Abstract: This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes equations. The thesis is divided in four independent chapters.The first chapter involves a rigorous discussion about the energy's dissipation law, proposed by theory of the turbulence K41, in the deterministic setting of the homogeneous and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with a stationary external force (the force only depends of the spatial variable) and on the whole space R3. The energy's dissipation law, also called the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, characterizes the energy's dissipation rate (in the form of heat) of a turbulent fluid and this law was developed by A.N.

Kolmogorov in 1941. However, its deduction (which uses mainly tools of statistics) is not fully understood until our days and then an active research area consists in studying this law in the rigorous framework of the Navier-Stokes equations which describe in a mathematical way the fluids motion and in particular the movement of turbulent fluids. In this setting, the purpose of this chapter is to highlight the fact that if we consider the Navier-Stokes equations on R3 then certain physical quantities, necessary for the study of the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, have no a rigorous definition and then to give a sense to these quantities we suggest to consider the Navier-Stokes equations with an additional damping term. In the framework of these damped equations, we obtain some estimates for the energy's dissipation rate according to the Kolmogorov's dissipation law.In the second chapter we are interested in study the stationary solutions of the damped Navier- Stokes introduced in the previous chapter. These stationary solutions are a particular type of solutions which do not depend of the temporal variable and their study is motivated by the fact that we always consider the Navier-Stokes equations with a stationary external force. In this chapter we study two properties of the stationary solutions : the first property concerns the stability of these solutions where we prove that if we have a control on the external force then all non stationary solution (with depends of both spatial and temporal variables) converges toward a stationary solution. The second property concerns the decay in spatial variable of the stationary solutions. These properties of stationary solutions are a consequence of the damping term introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations.In the third chapter we still study the stationary solutions of Navier-Stokes equations but now we consider the classical equations (without any additional damping term). The purpose of this chapter is to study an other problem related to the deterministic description of the turbulence : the frequency decay of the stationary solutions. Indeed, according to the K41 theory, if the fluid is in a laminar setting then the stationary solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations must exhibit a exponential frequency decay which starts at lows frequencies. But, if the fluid is in a turbulent setting then this exponential frequency decay must be observed only at highs frequencies. In this chapter, using some Fourier analysis tools, we give a precise description of this exponential frequency decay in the laminar and in the turbulent setting.In the fourth and last chapter we return to the stationary solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations and we study the uniqueness of these solutions in the particular case without any external force. Following some ideas of G. Seregin, we study the uniqueness of these solutions first in the framework of Lebesgue spaces of and then in the a general framework of Morrey spaces.","(624, 16)","The Navier-Stokes equations provide a fundamental framework for understanding the behavior of fluids in a wide range of applications. One phenomenon that is crucial to explaining such behavior is the turbulence that fluids exhibit. Turbulence is a complex, dynamic process that has resisted detailed analytical investigation due to its highly nonlinear nature. Instead, researchers often rely on numerical simulations, which in turn demand accurate and efficient models for describing turbulence. 

This paper presents a thorough overview of deterministic descriptions of turbulence within the realm of Navier-Stokes equations. By focusing on the use of deterministic models, we aim to better understand the nature of turbulence, how it arises, and how it can be controlled or harnessed for practical purposes. The need for such models is pressing, as they can be used to improve the design of fluid-based technologies, such as naval vessels, aircraft, and wind turbines, among others.

The main body of the paper is divided into several sections that cover different aspects of deterministic descriptions of turbulence. The first section introduces the Navier-Stokes equations and provides a brief overview of their solution. The second section then delves into deterministic models of turbulence, starting with a basic introduction to the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence and moving on to more advanced models. In particular, we investigate models based on the concepts of eddies and energy cascades, as well as models that use multiscale approaches to capture the range of phenomena that turbulence can exhibit.

In the third section of the paper, we turn our attention to numerical simulations of turbulence. We describe the use of high-performance computing and sophisticated algorithms to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, while titrating the advantages and limitations of various numerical methods. We then proceed to describe how deterministic descriptions of turbulence can be integrated into numerical simulations for optimal performance and predictive capabilities. 

The final section of the paper discusses some of the key challenges facing the field in the coming years. These include the need for more efficient and accurate models, the development of novel simulation techniques, and the integration of experimental data to improve model prediction. We conclude by highlighting some of the potential applications of deterministic models of turbulence to industrial processes, environmental studies, and even astrophysics.

Overall, this paper presents an in-depth review of deterministic descriptions of turbulence in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the nature of turbulence and the tools necessary to control it. It is our hope that this work will help to shape future research in this important and challenging area of physics.",455,,,"This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes equations. The main goal of this work is to understand the mechanism of the transition from the laminar flow to the fully developed turbulent flow. In order to achieve this goal, we use the direct numerical simulation (DNS) method to solve the Navier - Stokes equations. The DNS method is based on the discretization of the partial differential equations that describe the fluid flow. The discretization is performed using the finite difference method, which is a numerical method for solving partial differential equations. The finite difference method is used to approximate the derivatives in the partial differential equations by finite differences, which are the differences between the values of the function at different points in the domain. The resulting system of algebraic equations is then solved using an iterative method, such as the Gauss-Seidel method or the conjugate gradient method. The DNS method has been used to simulate a wide range of fluid flows, including laminar flows, transitional flows, and fully developed turbulent flows. In this thesis, we use the DNS method to study the transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow in a channel flow. The channel flow is a type of flow that occurs when a fluid flows through a channel with a constant cross-sectional area. The channel flow can be either laminar or turbulent, depending on the Reynolds number of the flow. The Reynolds number is a dimensionless number that is used to characterize the flow. It is defined as the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces in the flow. When the Reynolds number is low, the flow is laminar, and when the Reynolds number is high, the flow is turbulent. In our study, we start with a laminar flow and gradually increase the Reynolds number until the flow becomes fully developed turbulent. We observe that as the Reynolds number increases, the flow becomes more and more unstable, and eventually transitions to a fully developed turbulent state. We also observe that the transition to turbulence is accompanied by the formation of large-scale structures in the flow, such as vortices and eddies. These structures are responsible for the transport of momentum and energy in the flow, and they play a crucial role in the development of turbulence. In addition to the DNS method, we also use the spectral method to study the turbulence in the channel flow. The spectral method is a numerical method that is based on the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform is a mathematical operation that transforms a function from the time domain to the frequency domain. The spectral method uses the Fourier transform to represent the flow field as a superposition of sinusoidal waves with different frequencies.","[(503, 22)]","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes equations (NSE). The main goal of the research is to develop a mathematical model of the NSE, which can be used to predict the evolution of the turbulent flow.

The first part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of a mathematical model for the NSE. The model is based on the Eulerian description of the flow, which is supplemented by the Lagrangian description.

In the second part, the mathematical model is used to study the evolution of a turbulent flow. The results of the numerical simulations are compared with the experimental data.

Finally, the third part is devoted to the study of the influence of the Reynolds number on the flow. The Reynolds number is defined as the ratio of the inertial force to the viscous force.

This PhD thesis can be used as a basis for further research in the field of mathematical modeling of turbulent flows.","[(180, 9)]"

Abstract: Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is","Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of multivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular, the diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite naturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum Parsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the analyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve the major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their discretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an unsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction How do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform themselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to present-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout the Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between these, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract some digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is classification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From images obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his observations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter (the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four categories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the famous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these classes, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been refined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global classification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by Hubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used to represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the Hubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can be understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations found between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one must admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble classification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the most obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate, qualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to characterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant multivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since the year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble classification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble classification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet emerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate analyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling the observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar clusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant objects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our present day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.

Astrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in astrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum Parsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new exploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \& Fraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a larger number of objects must now be analysed. In this paper, I","(680, 35)","Clustering is a widely used technique in astrophysics to study celestial objects and their properties. However, traditional clustering approaches often fall short in properly accounting for the complex evolutionary relationships between objects, especially those involving large-scale astrophysical phenomena. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the use of phylogenetic tools in clustering analyses in order to better understand the underlying evolutionary processes governing celestial objects in astrophysical systems.

We begin by introducing the fundamentals of phylogenetics and how it can be applied to astrophysics. We describe the concept of a ""phylogenetic tree"" which captures the hypothesized evolutionary relationships between celestial objects based on their observable traits and characteristics. By constructing these phylogenetic trees, we can gain insights into the evolutionary processes that govern these objects and how they may have evolved over time.

We then discuss how these phylogenetic tools can be incorporated into clustering analyses. We introduce a novel method for constructing phylogenetic distance matrices, which can be used as input into traditional clustering algorithms. By utilizing these distance matrices, we can cluster celestial objects based not only on their observable traits, but also on their evolutionary relationships, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical systems.

We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study of a large-scale simulation of galaxy formation and evolution. We show that the use of phylogenetic-based clustering leads to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history of galaxies within the simulation. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be used to identify ""outlier"" objects that may have unique evolutionary histories or properties.

Finally, we discuss the potential applications of phylogenetic-based clustering in future astrophysical research. We highlight the usefulness of this approach in studying diverse astrophysical systems, including stars, planets, and even entire galaxies. We also propose potential extensions to our method, such as incorporating additional sources of data or refining the phylogenetic analyses themselves.

In conclusion, this paper showcases the power of using phylogenetic tools in clustering analyses within astrophysics. By accounting for the complex evolutionary relationships between celestial objects, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical systems and their properties. We hope that this paper serves as a starting point for future research into the application of phylogenetics within astrophysics and beyond.",382,,,"Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is one such field where phylogenetic methods have been successfully applied. In this paper, we propose a new method for clustering astrophysical data using phylogenetic tools. Our method is based on the principle of maximum parsimony, which states that the most likely explanation for a set of observations is the one that requires the fewest changes. We apply this principle to the problem of clustering astrophysical objects based on their physical properties. We show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. We also discuss potential applications of our method in other areas of astrophysics.","[(123, 7)]","Clustering is an important tool in astrophysics, as it allows astronomers to group objects according to their properties. Clustering methods can be divided into two main categories: hierarchical and non-hierarchical. Hierarchical clustering methods are based on the assumption that objects with similar properties are more likely to be clustered together than objects with different properties. Non-hierarchial clustering methods do not make this assumption, and can therefore be used to cluster objects with very different properties.

Method: The authors use a phylogenetic approach to cluster galaxies. Phylogenetic trees are used to represent the evolutionary history of a group of objects. In this case, the objects are galaxies, and the phylogenetic tree represents their evolutionary history from the Big Bang to the present day. The authors use this phylogenetic tree to group galaxies into clusters, and then use these clusters to predict their future evolution.

Results: The authors find that their method produces more accurate results than previous methods. They also show that it is possible to use their method to predict the evolution of galaxies in the future.

Conclusion: This paper shows that phylogenetic clustering is an effective tool for clustering galaxies. It is also possible to use phylogenetic clustering to predict future galaxy evolution.","[(225, 12)]"

Abstract: Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the value of the statistic statistically significant or nonsignificant on the bases of a P value derived from a null-hypothesis test.

Taking into account that studies are manly conducted in sample, the use of null hypothesis testing only allows estimating the true values (population) of the statistics used. However, evidence has grown in many areas of knowledge that this approach often leads to confusion and misinterpretation. To overcome this limitation they have recently emerged recommendations to support the statistical analysis with approaches that make use of more intuitive interpretations and more practical, especially based on the magnitudes (certainty / uncertainty) of the true values found. With the intent to provide alternative solutions to methodological designs recurrently used in research in sports sciences, this paper will seek to i) briefly spell out some of the weaknesses associated with the null hypothesis tests based in the P value; ii) reflect on the implications of the use of practical/clinical significance as opposed to statistical significance; iii) submit proposals for use the inferences based on the magnitude, particularly in the visualization and interpretation of results; iv) present and discuss the limitations of magnitude-based inference. Thus, this update article discourages, in a sustained-based, the use of significance tests based only on the concept of null hypothesis. Alternatively, it is proposed to use methods of inference based on magnitudes as they allow interpretations of the practical/clinical effects results obtained.","(274, 7)","The use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has been widely criticized in the field of sports science, leading to the call for alternative statistical methods that can offer better insight into the magnitude of effects. Inferential statistics based on magnitude-based inferences (MBI) have emerged as a promising alternative to NHST for investigating sports-related research questions.

MBI offers the possibility of quantifying the magnitude of differences between groups or treatments, rather than simply testing for statistically significant differences. This approach provides researchers with a more meaningful interpretation of their results and can ultimately lead to more informed conclusions that are relevant to practitioners and athletes alike.

The need to move away from NHST is not only due to its limitations in providing meaningful results, but also because of its reliance on arbitrary thresholds (e.g., a p-value of 0.05) that do not necessarily reflect the strength and importance of the observed effects. In contrast, MBI uses a statistical approach that is based on the estimation of effect sizes and their confidence intervals, enabling a more nuanced interpretation of the findings. 

Moreover, MBI can also mitigate problems associated with small sample sizes, which are common in sports science research. By focusing on effect size rather than the p-value, MBI can provide more stable and reliable estimates of the true population effect, even when working with small sample sizes.

MBI also offers advantages over other approaches, such as Bayesian statistics, in terms of its simplicity, ease of interpretation, and its potential to improve scientific communication. By adopting MBI, researchers and practitioners in sports science can overcome some of the limitations of NHST and obtain more meaningful and informative results.

In conclusion, the use of MBI in the investigation of sports-related research questions is becoming increasingly popular. MBI offers a more meaningful and informative approach to statistical inference, which can ultimately lead to more informed conclusions and practical implications for athletes and practitioners. The scientific community should continue to embrace and explore the potential of MBI as a valuable alternative to NHST in sports science research.",349,,,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of magnitude-based inference (MBI) in sports science research. The need to break away from null hypothesis testing (NHT) and p-values was highlighted. MBI was found to be a promising alternative to NHT, as it provides a more intuitive and informative approach to statistical analysis. However, further research is needed to fully understand the advantages and limitations of MBI in sports science research.","[(82, 4)]","Your role is a scientist writing a research abstract for the paper titled 'Infer\^encia Baseada em Magnitudes na investiga\c{c}\~ao em Ci\^encias do Esporte.

Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set","Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. A $k$-dimensional box is a Cartesian product of closed intervals $[a_1,b_1]\times [a_2,b_2]\times...\times [a_k,b_k]$. The {\it boxicity} of $G$, $\boxi(G)$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ can be represented as the intersection graph of $k$-dimensional boxes, i.e. each vertex is mapped to a $k$-dimensional box and two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and only if their corresponding boxes intersect. Let $\poset=(S,P)$ be a poset where $S$ is the ground set and $P$ is a reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive binary relation on $S$. The dimension of $\poset$, $\dim(\poset)$ is the minimum integer $t$ such that $P$ can be expressed as the intersection of $t$ total orders. Let $G_\poset$ be the \emph{underlying comparability graph} of $\poset$, i.e. $S$ is the vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are comparable in $\poset$. It is a well-known fact that posets with the same underlying comparability graph have the same dimension. The first result of this paper links the dimension of a poset to the boxicity of its underlying comparability graph. In particular, we show that for any poset $\poset$, $\boxi(G_\poset)/(\chi(G_\poset)-1) \le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$, where $\chi(G_\poset)$ is the chromatic number of $G_\poset$ and $\chi(G_\poset)\ne1$. It immediately follows that if $\poset$ is a height-2 poset, then $\boxi(G_\poset)\le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ since the underlying comparability graph of a height-2 poset is a bipartite graph. The second result of the paper relates the boxicity of a graph $G$ with a natural partial order associated with the \emph{extended double cover} of $G$, denoted as $G_c$: Note that $G_c$ is a bipartite graph with partite sets $A$ and $B$ which are copies of $V(G)$ such that corresponding to every $u\in V(G)$, there are two vertices $u_A\in A$ and $u_B\in B$ and $\{u_A,v_B\}$ is an edge in $G_c$ if and only if either $u=v$ or $u$ is adjacent to $v$ in $G$. Let $\poset_c$ be the natural height-2 poset associated with $G_c$ by making $A$ the set of minimal elements and $B$ the set of maximal elements. We show that $\frac{\boxi(G)}{2} \le \dim(\poset_c) \le 2\boxi(G)+4$. These results have some immediate and significant consequences. The upper bound $\dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ allows us to derive hitherto unknown upper bounds for poset dimension such as $\dim(\poset)\le 2\tw(G_\poset)+4$, since boxicity of any graph is known to be at most its $\tw+2$. In the other direction, using the already known bounds for partial order dimension we get the following: (1) The boxicity of any graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ is $O(\Delta\log^2\Delta)$ which is an improvement over the best known upper bound of $\Delta^2+2$. (2) There exist graphs with boxicity $\Omega(\Delta\log\Delta)$. This disproves a conjecture that the boxicity of a graph is $O(\Delta)$. (3) There exists no polynomial-time algorithm to approximate the boxicity of a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with a factor of $O(n^{0.5-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$, unless $NP=ZPP$.","(798, 21)","Boxicity and Poset Dimension are two closely related concepts in combinatorial optimization that have recently received extensive attention. Boxicity refers to the smallest integer k such that a graph can be represented as the intersection graph of k-dimensional axis-aligned boxes. Poset Dimension, on the other hand, measures the smallest number of linear extensions required to represent a partially ordered set (poset). While seemingly distinct, recent research has shown that these two concepts are closely related, and understanding one can give insight into the other.

The study of these two concepts has important practical applications in fields such as scheduling, logistics, and VLSI layout design. For example, in scheduling applications, boxicity can be used to construct scheduling models based on resource constraints where the resources have different capacities. These models are used in a variety of industries, such as manufacturing and transportation, to optimize the use of resources and increase efficiency.

In the past few decades, much research has been devoted to the algorithmic aspects of Boxicity and Poset Dimension. Algorithms have been developed to compute the boxicity and the poset dimension of a given graph, which have found applications in data analysis and optimization. Additionally, several linear time algorithms have been developed to compute the poset dimension of certain classes of posets such as grid posets.

Despite these algorithmic advances, there are still many open problems related to Boxicity and Poset Dimension. One such problem is determining the relationship between these two concepts for specific classes of graphs. Another open problem is determining the computational complexity of the poset dimension problem for certain classes of posets.

In recent years, researchers have also explored the relationship between Boxicity and Poset Dimension and other graph parameters, such as tree-width, clique number, and chromatic number. Several results have been obtained showing connections between these parameters, which can be useful when analyzing large datasets.

Overall, the study of Boxicity and Poset Dimension has applications in a wide range of fields and has stimulated much research in combinatorial optimization. Although many problems related to these concepts remain open, recent advances have shed light on their connections to other graph parameters, and further research in this area has the potential to unlock new insights and improve the efficiency of data analysis at large.",380,,,"Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$.

Each of the three countries has a regulatory framework and national technological innovation projects for education and digital education;- public and private academic institutions which, through their rectors, presidents and technical and pedagogical leaders, demonstrate their profound convictions for digital education (for reasons of quality, competitiveness and economic interest).

However, given the rather centralized governance model at state level, the majority of academic institutions in the three countries are often awaiting the promulgation of legal texts (decrees, charters, conventions, directives , Etc.) that enable them to act and adopt innovative solutions in teaching and research;- Teacher-researchers relatively little consulted in this expertise, but sufficiently engaged as actors on the ground to be able to predict their points of view with regard to the use of digital in their pedagogical and research activities. Teachers and researchers with relatively modest incomes would inevitably have a decisive role in any academic reform on the digital level if concrete mobilizing arguments could compensate for their shortfalls by joining digital training or development projects or programs.","(631, 14)","This research paper explores the potential of distance learning and digital tools for higher education and research in the Asia-Pacific region, specifically focusing on Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The second part of this paper presents a set of recommendations and a roadmap for implementing these technologies in these countries.

The first recommendation is to invest in infrastructure that supports digital learning. This includes building robust networks, providing access to digital devices, and training teachers and students on how to use these tools effectively. Governments and universities must collaborate to make these resources widely available.

The second recommendation is to create and curate high-quality digital content. Textbooks, lectures, and other learning materials should be developed or adapted for digital formats, and made available online for free or at a low cost. Collaboration between institutions can help pool resources and reduce duplication of effort.

The third recommendation is to develop interactive and collaborative learning tools. These tools can help students engage with course materials and with each other, even when they are studying remotely. This can include videoconferencing software, social media platforms, and online discussion forums.

The fourth recommendation is to ensure that the development of digital learning tools is based on research and best practices. This includes evaluating the effectiveness of different tools and approaches, and using this information to improve their design and implementation. Research should also be conducted on the impact of digital learning on student outcomes.

The final recommendation is to foster a culture of innovation and collaboration. This includes creating spaces for experimentation and learning, and providing opportunities for educators and researchers to share their experiences and insights. Governments and universities must work together to support this culture.

To achieve these recommendations, a roadmap is proposed that outlines the necessary steps and timelines. This includes identifying key stakeholders and partners, setting up pilot projects, and scaling up successful initiatives. The roadmap also highlights potential challenges and risks that must be addressed, such as the need for adequate funding and the risk of unequal access to digital resources.

Overall, this paper argues that distance learning and digital tools have the potential to transform higher education and research in the Asia-Pacific region, but that careful planning and implementation are necessary to ensure their effectiveness and accessibility. The recommendations and roadmap presented in this paper can serve as a starting point for governments, universities, and other stakeholders in the region who are interested in pursuing this path.",410,,,"Your role is a scientist writing a research abstract for the paper titled 'Formation {\`a} distance et outils num{\'e}riques pour l'enseignement sup{\'e}rieur et la recherche en Asie-Pacifique (Cambodge, Laos, Vietnam).

Abstract: CEA/IRFM is conducting R\&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the","CEA/IRFM is conducting R\&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the 5 GHz ITER LHCD system, which is expected to transmit 20 MW of RF power to the plasma. Two 5 GHz 500 kW BeO pill-box type window prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company, in close collaboration with CEA/IRFM. Both windows have been validated at low power, showing good agreement between measured and modeling, with a return loss better than 32 dB and an insertion loss below 0.05 dB. This paper reports on the window RF design and the low power measurements. The high power tests up to 500kW have been carried out in March 2013 in collaboration with NFRI. Results of these tests are also reported. In the current ITER LHCD design, 20 MW Continuous Wave (CW) of Radio-Frequency power at 5 GHz are expected to be generated and transmitted to the plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat waveguide pressure, forty eight 5 GHz 500kW CW windows are to be assembled on the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, forty eight additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate and monitor the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line pressure. These windows are identified as being one of the main critical components for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies [1] [2] [3] or more recently [4] [5] , and clearly require an important R\&D effort. In this context and even if the LHCD system is not part of the construction baseline, the CEA/IRFM is conducting a R\&D effort in order to validate a design and the performances of these RF windows. In order to begin the assessment of this need, two 5 GHz 500 kW/5 s pill-box type windows prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company in close collaboration with the CEA/IRFM [6]. The section 2 of this paper reports the RF and mechanical design of a 5 GHz window. Some features of the mechanical design and the experimental RF measurements at low power are reported in section 3. High power results, made in collaboration with NFRI, are detailed in section 4. The development of CW windows is discussed in the conclusion. 2-RF AND MECHANICAL DESIGN The proposed 5 GHz RF window is based on a pill-box design [2] , i.e. a ceramic brazed in portion of a circular waveguide, connected on either side to a rectangular waveguide section. Typical design rules of thumb of such device are circular section diameter about the same size of the diagonal of the rectangular waveguide (cf. FIGURE 1). Without taking into account the ceramic, the circular section length is approximately half a guided wavelength of the circular TE 11 mode, in order for the device to act as a half-wave transformer.

Once optimized, taking into account the ceramic, matching is correct only for a narrow band of frequency and is very sensitive to the device dimensions and the ceramic relative permittivity. The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be extracted by an active water cooling, depends on the inside electric field topology and of ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent). Undesirable modes due to parasitic resonances can be excited in the ceramic volume, raising the electric field and","(624, 24)","The development of next-generation fusion reactors, such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), requires the use of high power sources to generate and sustain plasma. The Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system is one such high-energy source that is designed to provide steady-state current drive for fusion reactor operation. In order to achieve this, the LHCD system requires a high-power window capable of transmitting RF power to the plasma.

This paper describes the design and RF measurements of a 5 GHz 500 kW window for the ITER LHCD system. The goal of this research was to develop an optimized design for the window that would meet the stringent requirements of the LHCD system, while also providing reliable and efficient operation. The window design was based on a number of key factors, including the transmission properties of the materials, the need for high power handling capability, and the thermal management of the structure.

Simulations were used to optimize the design of the window, and several prototypes were fabricated to investigate the performance of the design under a variety of conditions. RF measurements were taken on the prototypes to determine their transmission properties and to verify that they met the requirements of the LHCD system. The results of these measurements revealed that the window design was able to meet all of the high-power requirements of the ITER LHCD system.

The research also investigated the thermal behavior of the window during operation, using simulations and experimental measurements. The results showed that the thermal management of the window was critical to its performance, as high-power RF transmission caused significant heating of the window. The simulations and experiments showed that effective cooling of the window was necessary to maintain reliable and efficient operation.

In conclusion, this paper presents the design and RF measurements of a 5 GHz 500 kW window for the ITER LHCD system. The research demonstrated the feasibility of the window design, and provided important insights into the challenges associated with high-power RF transmission and thermal management.

The LHCD window is a critical component for the LHCD (Laser-Heated Confinement Divertor) system of ITER. The window is designed to operate at 5 GHz with a maximum power of 500 kW. The window design is based on the use of a 1.5 mm-thick Al-Cu-Mg alloy with a 0.5 mm thick Cu-Mg-Ni-Zr (CMNZ) coating. The CMNZ coating is deposited on the Al-Cu alloy by means of an electron-beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) process. The EB-PVD process is used to deposit the CMNZ coating in order to improve the mechanical properties of the window. The mechanical properties are improved by increasing the hardness of the coating and by decreasing the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the coating. The CTE of the CMNZ-coated window is lower than that of the uncoated window by a factor of 2.5. The mechanical and thermal properties of the coated and uncoated windows are measured by means of nanoindentation and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. The nanoindentation measurements show that the hardness and Young's modulus of the coated window are higher than those of uncoated window. The DSC measurements indicate that the thermal expansion coefficient of the coated windows is lower than the uncoated windows. The results of the nanoindentation tests and the DSC measurements are in good agreement with each other and with the theoretical predictions. The results show that the coating improves the mechanical properties and reduces the thermal expansion of the window material. The results also show that","[(319, 15)]"

Abstract: Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron","Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron to centimeter size. Meteorites are evidence that individual grains of those sizes were collected and assembled into planetesimals in the young solar system. Aims. We assess the efficiency of dust collection of a swarm of non-drifting planetesimals {\rev with radii ranging from 1 to $10^3$\,km and beyond. Methods. We calculate the collision probability of dust drifting in the disk due to gas drag by planetesimal accounting for several regimes depending on the size of the planetesimal, dust, and orbital distance: the geometric, Safronov, settling, and three-body regimes. We also include a hydrodynamical regime to account for the fact that small grains tend to be carried by the gas flow around planetesimals. Results. We provide expressions for the collision probability of dust by planetesimals and for the filtering efficiency by a swarm of planetesimals. For standard turbulence conditions (i.e., a turbulence parameter $\alpha=10^{-2}$), filtering is found to be inefficient, meaning that when crossing a minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) belt of planetesimals extending between 0.1 AU and 35 AU most dust particles are eventually accreted by the central star rather than colliding with planetesimals. However, if the disk is weakly turbulent ($\alpha=10^{-4}$) filtering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all smaller than about 10 km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in the geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km in size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller than one tenth of the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case most collisions take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very different properties: we find that the local filtering efficiency $x_{filter,MMSN}$ scales with $r^{-7/4}$ (where $r$ is the orbital distance) in the geometric regime, but with $r^{-1/4}$ to $r^{1/4}$ in the settling regime.

This implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur close to the central star and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the other hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling regime is expected to be more gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust particles much smaller than millimeter size tend only to be captured by the smallest planetesimals because they otherwise move on gas streamlines and their collisions take place in the hydrodynamical regime. Conclusions. Our results hint at an inside-out formation of planetesimals in the infant solar system because small planetesimals in the geometrical limit can filter dust much more efficiently close to the central star. However, even a fully-formed belt of planetesimals such as the MMSN only marginally captures inward-drifting dust and this seems to imply that dust in the protosolar disk has been filtered by planetesimals even smaller than 1 km (not included in this study) or that it has been assembled into planetesimals by other mechanisms (e.g., orderly growth, capture into vortexes). Further refinement of our work concerns, among other things: a quantitative description of the transition region between the hydro and settling regimes; an assessment of the role of disk turbulence for collisions, in particular in the hydro regime; and the coupling of our model to a planetesimal formation model.","(646, 20)","This research paper explores the mechanisms of dust filtering and processing in planetesimals, specifically focusing on non-drifting planetesimals. The collision probabilities for such planetesimals were derived and analyzed to illuminate their impacts on the filtration and processing of dust. These collision probabilities were analyzed through numerical simulations, which incorporated varied parameters such as planetesimal radius and density as well as dust particle size and distribution.


The results of the analysis show that non-drifting planetesimals play a significant role in the early stages of planet formation through their ability to filter and process dust. Through collisions with dust particles, these planetesimals are able to both grow in size and remove debris from the surrounding environment. The effects of this filtering and processing are not only important for the planetesimal itself, but also relevant for later stages of planet formation when large bodies form through collisions of planetesimals.


The analytical framework and numerical simulations used in the research provide a foundation for future studies into the processes of dust filtering and processing by planetesimals. The collision probabilities derived for non-drifting planetesimals can be applied to other studies of planetesimal growth and dust filtration, improving our understanding of early stages of planetary formation.


An important implication of this research is that the mechanisms of dust filtration and processing by non-drifting planetesimals enable the successful formation of larger bodies like planets and asteroids, crucial to the evolution of our solar system and others. By examining these mechanisms, insights can be gained not only into the formation of planets, but also into the evolution of other celestial bodies throughout the universe.


In conclusion, this research paper provides a thorough analysis of the collision probabilities for non-drifting planetesimals and their impact on the processing and filtering of dust. The results show that non-drifting planetesimals play an important role in the early stages of planet formation through their ability to remove debris and grow in size. This research can improve our understanding of the formation of planets not only in our solar system, but throughout the universe as well. The analytical framework and numerical simulations used in this study provide a strong foundation for further research in this field.",368,,,"Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron-sized grains to pebbles up to several centimeters in size. These dust grains are thought to be the building blocks of planetesimals, which in turn form planets. However, the process by which dust grains grow into planetesimals is not well understood. Aims. We aim to study the growth of dust grains into planetesimals by considering the effects of collisions between dust grains and planetesimals. Methods. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to model the collisional evolution of dust grains in a protoplanetary disk. We assume that the dust grains are spherical and have a size distribution that follows a power law with an exponent of -3.5. We also assume that the planetesimals are drifting through the disk at a constant velocity. Results. We find that the collision probability between a dust grain and a planetesimal increases with the size of the dust grain. This is because larger dust grains have a larger cross-sectional area and are therefore more likely to collide with a planetesimal. We also find that the drift velocity of the planetesimals has a significant effect on the collision probability. When the drift velocity is low, the collision probability is higher because the planetesimals have more time to interact with the dust grains. However, when the drift velocity is high, the planetesimals move too quickly to interact effectively with the dust grains, resulting in a lower collision probability. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the growth of dust particles into planetesimals may be limited by the collisional interactions between the dust grains and the planetesimals.","[(294, 18)]","Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging in size from 0.1 to 1000 μm. Planetesimals are believed to be the main source of this dust.

Methodology. We used a 3D hydrodynamical model of a protoplanetary disk to simulate the evolution of a planetesimal population.

Abstract: Stylolites are ubiquitous geo-patterns observed in rocks in the upper crust, from geological reservoirs in","Stylolites are ubiquitous geo-patterns observed in rocks in the upper crust, from geological reservoirs in sedimentary rocks to deformation zones, in folds, faults, and shear zones. These rough surfaces play a major role in the dissolution of rocks around stressed contacts, the transport of dissolved material and the precipitation in surrounding pores. Consequently, they play an active role in the evolution of rock microstructures and rheological properties in the Earth's crust. They are observed individually or in networks, in proximity to fractures and joints, and in numerous geological settings. This review article deals with their geometrical and compositional characteristics and the factors leading to their genesis. The main questions this review focuses on are the following: How do they form? How can they be used to measure strain and formation stress? How do they control fluid flow in the upper crust?

Geometrically, stylolites have fractal roughness, with fractal geometrical properties exhibiting typically three scaling regimes: a self-affine scaling with Hurst exponent 1.1+/-0.1 at small scale (up to tens or hundreds of microns), another one with Hurst exponent around 0.5 to 0.6 at intermediate scale (up to millimeters or centimeters), and in the case of sedimentary stylolites, a flat scaling at large scale. More complicated anisotropic scaling (scaling laws depending of the direction of the profile considered) is found in the case of tectonic stylolites. We report models based on first principles from physical chemistry and statistical physics, including a mechanical component for the free-energy associated with stress concentrations, and a precise tracking of the influence of grain-scale heterogeneities and disorder on the resulting (micro)structures. Experimental efforts to reproduce stylolites in the laboratory are also reviewed. We show that although micrometer-size stylolite teeth are obtained in laboratory experiments, teeth deforming numerous grains have not yet been obtained experimentally, which is understandable given the very long formation time of such geometries. Finally, the applications of stylolites as strain and stress markers, to determine paleostress magnitude are reviewed. We show that the scalings in stylolite heights and the crossover scale between these scalings can be used to determine the stress magnitude (its scalar value) perpendicular to the stylolite surface during the stylolite formation, and that the stress anisotropy in the stylolite plane can be determined for the case of tectonic stylolites. We also show that the crossover between medium (millimetric) scales and large (pluricentimetric) scales, in the case of sedimentary stylolites, provides a good marker for the total amount of dissolution, which is still valid even when the largest teeth start to dissolve -- which leads to the loss of information, since the total deformation is not anymore recorded in a single marker structure. We discuss the impact of the stylolites on the evolution of the transport properties of the hosting rock, and show that they promote a permeability increase parallel to the stylolites, whereas their effect on the permeability transverse to the stylolite can be negligible, or may reduce the permeability, depending on the development of the stylolite.

Highlights: Stylolite formation depends on rock composition and structure, stress and fluids. Stylolite geometry, fractal and self-affine properties, network structure, are investigated. The experiments and physics-based numerical models for their formation are reviewed. Stylolites can be used as markers of strain, paleostress orientation and magnitude. Stylolites impact transport properties, as function of maturity and flow direction.","(627, 22)","Stylolites are a critical feature in sedimentary rocks, which have garnered significant interest over the years given their widespread occurrence and potential significance in several geological processes. In this review, we provide an extensive analysis of the literature available on stylolites, thereby enabling a better understanding of their behavior and formation mechanisms. First, we discuss the various historical perspectives on stylolites and the evolution of ideas explaining their formation. Subsequently, we delve into the current understanding of the physical and chemical processes that induce and animate stylolites. We highlight field and laboratory studies, alongside analytical techniques such as petrography, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe, and Raman spectroscopy, which have contributed significantly to the current state of knowledge on stylolites.

We further analyze the composition and mineralogy of stylolites with a discussion on their role in hydrocarbon exploration. We evaluate the interplay between mechanical and chemical compaction mechanisms in their formation and briefly examine some of the significant implications in reservoir quality assessments. We discuss how their presence can affect porosity, permeability, and ultimately oil recovery in underground reservoirs and provide a comprehensive review of the available literature on stylolites as a tool in hydrocarbon exploration. 

Furthermore, we expound on the association of stylolites with various geological phenomena, including deformation stress, fluid activity, and diagenesis. We examine the evidence of syn-sedimentary versus post-sedimentary origin of stylolites, which has significant implications for their interpretation and paleo-environmental reconstructions. The review offers insight into the potential use of stylolites in paleostress and paleohydrology analysis and their significance as proxies for burial depth. 

We conclude our review by discussing current controversies in the field of stylolites such as their mode of initiation, the extent of their influence on rock properties, and their role as deformation markers.

Stylolites form as a result of the crystallization of silica-rich magma in the presence of water and carbon dioxide. The crystallization of the silica-rich melt results in the formation of a network of silica veins, which can be up to a few centimeters in diameter. These veins are filled with silica-rich minerals, such as quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite. The silica-rich veins are surrounded by a silica-poor matrix, which is typically composed of plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene, olivine, amphibole, and biotite.

Stylolitic rocks can be found in a wide range of geological environments, including sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. Stylolitic rocks are commonly found in sedimentary rocks, such as sandstones, shales, and limestones. They are also commonly found in igneous rocks, including granites, rhyolites, andesites, and basaltic rocks. In metamorphic environments, stylolites are typically found in gneisses, schists, and amphibolites.

The formation of stylolites is a complex process that involves the interaction of a number of factors, including temperature, pressure, and composition of the magma. The formation of a stylolite begins when a silica-rich body of magma begins to crystallize. As the magma crystallizes, it forms a network of quartz veins, which are then filled with silica minerals such as cristobalite and quartz. The quartz veins are then surrounded by a matrix of silica-poor material, which typically consists of feldspars, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and olivines.

As the magma continues to crystallize, the quartz veins continue to grow","[(304, 14)]"

Abstract: Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to give","Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to give H(2)O(2). Recently, the mutation of the Glu47 residue into alanine (E47A) in the active site of SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii has allowed the stabilization of an iron-peroxo species when quickly reacted with H(2)O(2) [Math{\'e} et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 4966-4967]. To further investigate this non-heme peroxo-iron species, we have carried out a M{\""o}ssbauer study of the (57)Fe-enriched E47A SOR from D. baarsii reacted quickly with H(2)O(2). Considering the M{\""o}ssbauer data, we conclude, in conjunction with the other spectroscopic data available and with the results of density functional calculations on related models, that this species corresponds to a high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) complex. This is one of the first examples of such a species in a biological system for which M{\""o}ssbauer parameters are now available: delta(/Fe) = 0.54 (1) mm/s, DeltaE(Q) = -0.80 (5) mm/s, and the asymmetry parameter eta = 0.60 (5) mm/s. The M{\""o}ssbauer and spin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on peroxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center in SOR from Pyrococcus furiosus, for which structural data are available in the literature [Yeh et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2499-2508]. For comparison, similar calculations have been carried out on a model derived from 2 (model 3), where the [CH(3)-S](1)(-) group has been replaced by the neutral [NH(3)](0) group [Neese and Solomon (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12829-12848]. Both models 2 and 3 contain a formally high-spin Fe(3+) ion (i.e., with empty minority spin orbitals). We found, however, a significant fraction (approximately 0.6 for 2, approximately 0.8 for 3) of spin (equivalently charge) spread over two occupied (minority spin) orbitals. The quadrupole splitting value for 2 is found to be negative and matches quite well the experimental value. The computed quadrupole tensors are rhombic in the case of 2 and axial in the case of 3. This difference originates directly from the presence of the thiolate ligand in 2. A correlation between experimental isomer shifts for Fe(3+) mononuclear complexes with computed electron densities at the iron nucleus has been built and used to evaluate the isomer shift values for 2 and 3 (0.56 and 0.63 mm/s, respectively). A significant increase of isomer shift value is found upon going from a methylthiolate to a nitrogen ligand for the Fe(3+) ion, consistent with covalency effects due to the presence of the axial thiolate ligand. Considering that the isomer shift value for 3 is likely to be in the 0.61-0.65 mm/s range [Horner et al. (2002) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 3278-3283], the isomer shift value for a high-spin eta(2)-O(2) Fe(3+) complex with an axial thiolate group can be estimated to be in the 0.54-0.58 mm/s range. The occurrence of a side-on peroxo intermediate in SOR is discussed in relation to the recent data published for a side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) species in another biological system [Karlsson et al.

Abstract: Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive","Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive reasoning. This is so because there are general and definite rules for the change of subjective probabilities through information or experience; induction and belief change are one and same topic, after all. The most basic of these rules is simply to conditionalize with respect to the information received; and there are similar and more general rules. 1 Hence, a fundamental reason for the epistemological success of probability theory is that there at all exists a well-behaved concept of conditional probability. Still, people have, and have reasons for, various concerns over probability theory. One of these is my starting point: Intuitively, we have the notion of plain belief; we believe propositions2 to be true (or to be false or neither). Probability theory, however, offers no formal counterpart to this notion. Believing A is not the same as having probability 1 for A, because probability 1 is incorrigible3; but plain belief is clearly corrigible. And believing A is not the same as giving A a probability larger than some 1 - c, because believing A and believing B is usually taken to be equivalent to believing A & B.4 Thus, it seems that the formal representation of plain belief has to take a non-probabilistic route. Indeed, representing plain belief seems easy enough: simply represent an epistemic state by the set of all propositions believed true in it or, since I make the common assumption that plain belief is deductively closed, by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it. But this does not yet provide a theory of induction, i.e.

an answer to the question how epistemic states so represented are changed tbrough information or experience. There is a convincing partial answer: if the new information is compatible with the old epistemic state, then the new epistemic state is simply represented by the conjunction of the new information and the old beliefs. This answer is partial because it does not cover the quite common case where the new information is incompatible with the old beliefs. It is, however, important to complete the answer and to cover this case, too; otherwise, we would not represent plain belief as conigible. The crucial problem is that there is no good completion. When epistemic states are represented simply by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it, the answer cannot be completed; and though there is a lot of fruitful work, no other representation of epistemic states has been proposed, as far as I know, which provides a complete solution to this problem. In this paper, I want to suggest such a solution. In [4], I have more fully argued that this is the only solution, if certain plausible desiderata are to be satisfied. Here, in section 2, I will be content with formally defining and intuitively explaining my proposal. I will compare my proposal with probability theory in section 3. It will turn out that the theory I am proposing is structurally homomorphic to probability theory in important respects and that it is thus equally easily implementable, but moreover computationally simpler. Section 4 contains a very brief comparison with various kinds of logics, in particular conditional logic, with Shackle's functions of potential surprise and related theories, and with the Dempster - Shafer theory of belief functions.","(632, 23)","Inductive reasoning plays a vital role in scientific inquiry by enabling the inference of conclusions from empirical data. Despite its significance, there exist fundamental challenges in explicating the foundations of inductive reasoning. In particular, traditional approaches have used probabilistic frameworks as the primary tool for modeling inductive reasoning. However, this approach has limited application in real-life scenarios, and even fails to provide an adequate explanation for phenomena that involve non-probabilistic or correlated uncertainties. In this paper, we introduce a general non-probabilistic theory of inductive reasoning, which offers a fresh perspective on traditional models of reasoning. Our theory considers inductive reasoning as a process of developing theories about the causal structure of a given phenomenon, and seeks to provide a systematic framework for this process. Our approach considers the problem of inductive reasoning as part of a larger context of decision-making under uncertainty, and utilizes tools from causal inference, game theory, and information theory.

Through the lens of our theory, we can better understand and formalize the process of inductive reasoning. Specifically, we articulate a new framework that identifies the causal structure of a given phenomenon as the key element for making sound inductive inferences, and further explore how this structure can be uncovered. Our framework is founded on the idea that inductive reasoning can be viewed as a game between the reasoner and nature, and that the optimal strategy in this game requires an analysis of the causal structure. We then introduce a new class of models that capture non-probabilistic uncertainties and are well-defined within this framework. These models are shown to be as versatile as probabilistic models in describing inductive reasoning, and in fact, can better capture the nuances of non-probabilistic uncertainties.

Overall, the proposed non-probabilistic theory of inductive reasoning offers a new approach to model and solve complicated inductive inference problems. It leverages advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence to bring us one step closer to achieving a more general understanding of inductive reasoning. We conclude by highlighting some future directions for research, including the challenges in developing new methodologies and applications for the principle of inductive inference. Ultimately, this work is a stepping stone towards deeper insights into the fundamental question of how we do science and build theories in the face of uncertainty.",386,,,"Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive reasoning. However, probability theory is not the only game in town. In this paper, we present a general non-probabilistic theory of inductive reasoning that is based on the notion of similarity. We argue that our theory is at least as good as probability theory in accounting for inductive reasoning, and that it has several advantages over probability theory. In particular, our theory does not suffer from some of the problems that plague probability theory, such as the problem of logical omniscience and the problem of old evidence. We also show that our theory can be used to provide a unified account of both deductive and inductive reasoning. Finally, we discuss some of the implications of our theory for epistemology and philosophy of science.","[(154, 7)]","Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive reasoning. In this paper, we present a general, non-probabilistic theory of inductive inference. The theory is based on the idea that inductive inferences can be understood as inferences to the best explanation (IBE). We show that IBE is a generalization of Bayesian inference, and that IBE and Bayesian inference are special cases of our general theory. We also show that our general theory can be applied to a wide range of inductive problems, including the problem of induction, the problem of inductive generalization, and the problem of abductive inference. Finally, we show that our theory can be used to solve a number of open problems in inductive reasoning, such as the problem of the inductive gap.
