This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes
","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes equations. The thesis is divided in four independent chapters.The first chapter involves a rigorous discussion about the energy's dissipation law, proposed by theory of the turbulence K41, in the deterministic setting of the homogeneous and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with a stationary external force (the force only depends of the spatial variable) and on the whole space R3. The energy's dissipation law, also called the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, characterizes the energy's dissipation rate (in the form of heat) of a turbulent fluid and this law was developed by A.N.

Kolmogorov in 1941. However, its deduction (which uses mainly tools of statistics) is not fully understood until our days and then an active research area consists in studying this law in the rigorous framework of the Navier-Stokes equations which describe in a mathematical way the fluids motion and in particular the movement of turbulent fluids. In this setting, the purpose of this chapter is to highlight the fact that if we consider the Navier-Stokes equations on R3 then certain physical quantities, necessary for the study of the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, have no a rigorous definition and then to give a sense to these quantities we suggest to consider the Navier-Stokes equations with an additional damping term. In the framework of these damped equations, we obtain some estimates for the energy's dissipation rate according to the Kolmogorov's dissipation law.In the second chapter we are interested in study the stationary solutions of the damped Navier- Stokes introduced in the previous chapter. These stationary solutions are a particular type of solutions which do not depend of the temporal variable and their study is motivated by the fact that we always consider the Navier-Stokes equations with a stationary external force. In this chapter we study two properties of the stationary solutions : the first property concerns the stability of these solutions where we prove that if we have a control on the external force then all non stationary solution (with depends of both spatial and temporal variables) converges toward a stationary solution. The second property concerns the decay in spatial variable of the stationary solutions. These properties of stationary solutions are a consequence of the damping term introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations.In the third chapter we still study the stationary solutions of Navier-Stokes equations but now we consider the classical equations (without any additional damping term). The purpose of this chapter is to study an other problem related to the deterministic description of the turbulence : the frequency decay of the stationary solutions. Indeed, according to the K41 theory, if the fluid is in a laminar setting then the stationary solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations must exhibit a exponential frequency decay which starts at lows frequencies. But, if the fluid is in a turbulent setting then this exponential frequency decay must be observed only at highs frequencies. In this chapter, using some Fourier analysis tools, we give a precise description of this exponential frequency decay in the laminar and in the turbulent setting.In the fourth and last chapter we return to the stationary solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations and we study the uniqueness of these solutions in the particular case without any external force. Following some ideas of G. Seregin, we study the uniqueness of these solutions first in the framework of Lebesgue spaces of and then in the a general framework of Morrey spaces.","(624, 16)","The Navier-Stokes equations provide a fundamental framework for understanding the behavior of fluids in a wide range of applications. One phenomenon that is crucial to explaining such behavior is the turbulence that fluids exhibit. Turbulence is a complex, dynamic process that has resisted detailed analytical investigation due to its highly nonlinear nature. Instead, researchers often rely on numerical simulations, which in turn demand accurate and efficient models for describing turbulence. 

This paper presents a thorough overview of deterministic descriptions of turbulence within the realm of Navier-Stokes equations. By focusing on the use of deterministic models, we aim to better understand the nature of turbulence, how it arises, and how it can be controlled or harnessed for practical purposes. The need for such models is pressing, as they can be used to improve the design of fluid-based technologies, such as naval vessels, aircraft, and wind turbines, among others.

The main body of the paper is divided into several sections that cover different aspects of deterministic descriptions of turbulence. The first section introduces the Navier-Stokes equations and provides a brief overview of their solution. The second section then delves into deterministic models of turbulence, starting with a basic introduction to the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence and moving on to more advanced models. In particular, we investigate models based on the concepts of eddies and energy cascades, as well as models that use multiscale approaches to capture the range of phenomena that turbulence can exhibit.

In the third section of the paper, we turn our attention to numerical simulations of turbulence. We describe the use of high-performance computing and sophisticated algorithms to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, while titrating the advantages and limitations of various numerical methods. We then proceed to describe how deterministic descriptions of turbulence can be integrated into numerical simulations for optimal performance and predictive capabilities. 

The final section of the paper discusses some of the key challenges facing the field in the coming years. These include the need for more efficient and accurate models, the development of novel simulation techniques, and the integration of experimental data to improve model prediction. We conclude by highlighting some of the potential applications of deterministic models of turbulence to industrial processes, environmental studies, and even astrophysics.

Overall, this paper presents an in-depth review of deterministic descriptions of turbulence in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the nature of turbulence and the tools necessary to control it. It is our hope that this work will help to shape future research in this important and challenging area of physics.","(489, 20)","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes
equations. The main goal of this work is to understand the mechanism of the transition from
the laminar flow to the turbulent one and to describe the properties of the developed
turbulence. In order to achieve this goal, we use the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the
Navier-Stokes equations. This method allows us to obtain the exact solution of the equations
and to study the properties of the flow in detail.
The first part of the thesis is devoted to the study of the transition from the laminar flow to
the turbulent one. We use the linear stability analysis to determine the critical Reynolds
number at which the laminar flow becomes unstable. We then use the DNS to study the
development of the instability and the transition to turbulence. We find that the transition
occurs through a series of bifurcations and that the final state of the flow depends on the
initial conditions.
In the second part of the thesis, we focus on the study of the developed turbulence. We use
the DNS to obtain the statistical properties of the flow, such as the mean velocity, the
turbulent kinetic energy, and the Reynolds stress. We also study the structure of the flow,
such as the vortices and the coherent structures. We find that these structures play an
important role in the dynamics of the flow and that they are responsible for the transfer of
energy from the large scales to the small scales.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of the turbulence in
the Navier- Stokes equations. We conclude that the DNS is a powerful tool for the
deterministic study of the turbulence and that it can provide valuable insights into the
properties of the flow.","[(329, 14)]","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes

Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is
","Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of multivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular, the diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite naturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum Parsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the analyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve the major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their discretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an unsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction How do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform themselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to present-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout the Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between these, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract some digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is classification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From images obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his observations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter (the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four categories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the famous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these classes, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been refined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global classification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by Hubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used to represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the Hubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can be understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations found between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one must admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble classification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the most obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate, qualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to characterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant multivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since the year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble classification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble classification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet emerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate analyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling the observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar clusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant objects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our present day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.

Astrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in astrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum Parsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new exploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \& Fraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a larger number of objects must now be analysed. In this paper, I","(680, 35)","Clustering is a widely used technique in astrophysics to study celestial objects and their properties. However, traditional clustering approaches often fall short in properly accounting for the complex evolutionary relationships between objects, especially those involving large-scale astrophysical phenomena. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the use of phylogenetic tools in clustering analyses in order to better understand the underlying evolutionary processes governing celestial objects in astrophysical systems.

We begin by introducing the fundamentals of phylogenetics and how it can be applied to astrophysics. We describe the concept of a ""phylogenetic tree"" which captures the hypothesized evolutionary relationships between celestial objects based on their observable traits and characteristics. By constructing these phylogenetic trees, we can gain insights into the evolutionary processes that govern these objects and how they may have evolved over time.

We then discuss how these phylogenetic tools can be incorporated into clustering analyses. We introduce a novel method for constructing phylogenetic distance matrices, which can be used as input into traditional clustering algorithms. By utilizing these distance matrices, we can cluster celestial objects based not only on their observable traits, but also on their evolutionary relationships, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical systems.

We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study of a large-scale simulation of galaxy formation and evolution. We show that the use of phylogenetic-based clustering leads to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history of galaxies within the simulation. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be used to identify ""outlier"" objects that may have unique evolutionary histories or properties.

Finally, we discuss the potential applications of phylogenetic-based clustering in future astrophysical research. We highlight the usefulness of this approach in studying diverse astrophysical systems, including stars, planets, and even entire galaxies. We also propose potential extensions to our method, such as incorporating additional sources of data or refining the phylogenetic analyses themselves.

In conclusion, this paper showcases the power of using phylogenetic tools in clustering analyses within astrophysics. By accounting for the complex evolutionary relationships between celestial objects, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical systems and their properties. We hope that this paper serves as a starting point for future research into the application of phylogenetics within astrophysics and beyond.","(417, 18)","Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is
one such field where phylogenetic methods have been successfully applied. In this paper, we explore the use of
phylogenetic tools for clustering in astrophysics. We first introduce the concept of phylogenetic trees and how
they can be used for clustering. We then present a case study where we apply phylogenetic methods to cluster
galaxies based on their physical properties. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and suggest
future directions for research in this area.
Phylogenetic trees are graphical representations of evolutionary relationships between organisms. They are
constructed by comparing the DNA or protein sequences of different organisms and inferring the evolutionary
relationships based on the similarities and differences in these sequences. Phylogenetic trees can be used for
clustering because they provide a natural way to group together organisms that are more closely related to each
other than to other organisms.
In our case study, we used phylogenetic trees to cluster galaxies based on their stellar masses, star formation
rates, and metallicities. We found that galaxies with similar physical properties tend to cluster together in the
phylogenetic tree. For example, galaxies with high stellar masses and low star formation rates tend to cluster
together in one branch of the tree, while galaxies with low stellar masses and high star formation rates tend
to cluster together in another branch of the tree. These results suggest that phylogenetic methods can be used
to identify groups of galaxies with similar physical characteristics.
The implications of our findings are significant for astrophysics. By using phylogenetic methods, we can gain a
deeper understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe. For example, we can use phylogenetic
methods to study the formation and evolution of galaxies, as well as the distribution of dark matter in the
universe. Additionally, phylogenetic methods may also be useful for studying other phenomena in astrophysics,
such as the formation of black holes and the origin of life.
In conclusion, we have shown that phylogenetic tools can be successfully applied to clustering in
astrophysics. Our case study demonstrates the potential of phylogenetic methods for studying the structure and
evolution of the universe. We hope that our work will inspire further research in this area and lead to new
discoveries in astrophysics.","[(419, 20)]","Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is

","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the value of the statistic statistically significant or nonsignificant on the bases of a P value derived from a null-hypothesis test.

Taking into account that studies are manly conducted in sample, the use of null hypothesis testing only allows estimating the true values (population) of the statistics used. However, evidence has grown in many areas of knowledge that this approach often leads to confusion and misinterpretation. To overcome this limitation they have recently emerged recommendations to support the statistical analysis with approaches that make use of more intuitive interpretations and more practical, especially based on the magnitudes (certainty / uncertainty) of the true values found. With the intent to provide alternative solutions to methodological designs recurrently used in research in sports sciences, this paper will seek to i) briefly spell out some of the weaknesses associated with the null hypothesis tests based in the P value; ii) reflect on the implications of the use of practical/clinical significance as opposed to statistical significance; iii) submit proposals for use the inferences based on the magnitude, particularly in the visualization and interpretation of results; iv) present and discuss the limitations of magnitude-based inference. Thus, this update article discourages, in a sustained-based, the use of significance tests based only on the concept of null hypothesis. Alternatively, it is proposed to use methods of inference based on magnitudes as they allow interpretations of the practical/clinical effects results obtained.","(274, 7)","The use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has been widely criticized in the field of sports science, leading to the call for alternative statistical methods that can offer better insight into the magnitude of effects. Inferential statistics based on magnitude-based inferences (MBI) have emerged as a promising alternative to NHST for investigating sports-related research questions.

MBI offers the possibility of quantifying the magnitude of differences between groups or treatments, rather than simply testing for statistically significant differences. This approach provides researchers with a more meaningful interpretation of their results and can ultimately lead to more informed conclusions that are relevant to practitioners and athletes alike.

The need to move away from NHST is not only due to its limitations in providing meaningful results, but also because of its reliance on arbitrary thresholds (e.g., a p-value of 0.05) that do not necessarily reflect the strength and importance of the observed effects. In contrast, MBI uses a statistical approach that is based on the estimation of effect sizes and their confidence intervals, enabling a more nuanced interpretation of the findings. 

Moreover, MBI can also mitigate problems associated with small sample sizes, which are common in sports science research. By focusing on effect size rather than the p-value, MBI can provide more stable and reliable estimates of the true population effect, even when working with small sample sizes.

MBI also offers advantages over other approaches, such as Bayesian statistics, in terms of its simplicity, ease of interpretation, and its potential to improve scientific communication. By adopting MBI, researchers and practitioners in sports science can overcome some of the limitations of NHST and obtain more meaningful and informative results.

In conclusion, the use of MBI in the investigation of sports-related research questions is becoming increasingly popular. MBI offers a more meaningful and informative approach to statistical inference, which can ultimately lead to more informed conclusions and practical implications for athletes and practitioners. The scientific community should continue to embrace and explore the potential of MBI as a valuable alternative to NHST in sports science research.","(378, 13)","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the

conventional methods and explore alternative approaches. This paper aims to shed light on the
importance of breaking away from null hypothesis testing and the use of p-values in sports science
research. By doing so, we hope to contribute to a more robust and reliable body of knowledge in
this field.

in sports science research. We will explore how these methods can lead to false positives and
false negatives, and how they can hinder our ability to draw meaningful conclusions from our

science. We will explore the use of Bayesian inference, which allows us to incorporate prior
knowledge and uncertainty into our analysis. We will also discuss the use of effect sizes and

Finally, we will conclude by discussing the implications of these alternative methods for sports
science research. We will argue that by breaking away from conventional methods, we can
improve the quality and reliability of our findings, and ultimately contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of sports science.","[(272, 11)]","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the

Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set
","Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. A $k$-dimensional box is a Cartesian product of closed intervals $[a_1,b_1]\times [a_2,b_2]\times...\times [a_k,b_k]$. The {\it boxicity} of $G$, $\boxi(G)$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ can be represented as the intersection graph of $k$-dimensional boxes, i.e. each vertex is mapped to a $k$-dimensional box and two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and only if their corresponding boxes intersect. Let $\poset=(S,P)$ be a poset where $S$ is the ground set and $P$ is a reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive binary relation on $S$. The dimension of $\poset$, $\dim(\poset)$ is the minimum integer $t$ such that $P$ can be expressed as the intersection of $t$ total orders. Let $G_\poset$ be the \emph{underlying comparability graph} of $\poset$, i.e. $S$ is the vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are comparable in $\poset$. It is a well-known fact that posets with the same underlying comparability graph have the same dimension. The first result of this paper links the dimension of a poset to the boxicity of its underlying comparability graph. In particular, we show that for any poset $\poset$, $\boxi(G_\poset)/(\chi(G_\poset)-1) \le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$, where $\chi(G_\poset)$ is the chromatic number of $G_\poset$ and $\chi(G_\poset)\ne1$. It immediately follows that if $\poset$ is a height-2 poset, then $\boxi(G_\poset)\le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ since the underlying comparability graph of a height-2 poset is a bipartite graph. The second result of the paper relates the boxicity of a graph $G$ with a natural partial order associated with the \emph{extended double cover} of $G$, denoted as $G_c$: Note that $G_c$ is a bipartite graph with partite sets $A$ and $B$ which are copies of $V(G)$ such that corresponding to every $u\in V(G)$, there are two vertices $u_A\in A$ and $u_B\in B$ and $\{u_A,v_B\}$ is an edge in $G_c$ if and only if either $u=v$ or $u$ is adjacent to $v$ in $G$. Let $\poset_c$ be the natural height-2 poset associated with $G_c$ by making $A$ the set of minimal elements and $B$ the set of maximal elements. We show that $\frac{\boxi(G)}{2} \le \dim(\poset_c) \le 2\boxi(G)+4$. These results have some immediate and significant consequences. The upper bound $\dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ allows us to derive hitherto unknown upper bounds for poset dimension such as $\dim(\poset)\le 2\tw(G_\poset)+4$, since boxicity of any graph is known to be at most its $\tw+2$. In the other direction, using the already known bounds for partial order dimension we get the following: (1) The boxicity of any graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ is $O(\Delta\log^2\Delta)$ which is an improvement over the best known upper bound of $\Delta^2+2$. (2) There exist graphs with boxicity $\Omega(\Delta\log\Delta)$. This disproves a conjecture that the boxicity of a graph is $O(\Delta)$. (3) There exists no polynomial-time algorithm to approximate the boxicity of a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with a factor of $O(n^{0.5-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$, unless $NP=ZPP$.","(798, 21)","Boxicity and Poset Dimension are two closely related concepts in combinatorial optimization that have recently received extensive attention. Boxicity refers to the smallest integer k such that a graph can be represented as the intersection graph of k-dimensional axis-aligned boxes. Poset Dimension, on the other hand, measures the smallest number of linear extensions required to represent a partially ordered set (poset). While seemingly distinct, recent research has shown that these two concepts are closely related, and understanding one can give insight into the other.

The study of these two concepts has important practical applications in fields such as scheduling, logistics, and VLSI layout design. For example, in scheduling applications, boxicity can be used to construct scheduling models based on resource constraints where the resources have different capacities. These models are used in a variety of industries, such as manufacturing and transportation, to optimize the use of resources and increase efficiency.

In the past few decades, much research has been devoted to the algorithmic aspects of Boxicity and Poset Dimension. Algorithms have been developed to compute the boxicity and the poset dimension of a given graph, which have found applications in data analysis and optimization. Additionally, several linear time algorithms have been developed to compute the poset dimension of certain classes of posets such as grid posets.

Despite these algorithmic advances, there are still many open problems related to Boxicity and Poset Dimension. One such problem is determining the relationship between these two concepts for specific classes of graphs. Another open problem is determining the computational complexity of the poset dimension problem for certain classes of posets.

In recent years, researchers have also explored the relationship between Boxicity and Poset Dimension and other graph parameters, such as tree-width, clique number, and chromatic number. Several results have been obtained showing connections between these parameters, which can be useful when analyzing large datasets.

Overall, the study of Boxicity and Poset Dimension has applications in a wide range of fields and has stimulated much research in combinatorial optimization. Although many problems related to these concepts remain open, recent advances have shed light on their connections to other graph parameters, and further research in this area has the potential to unlock new insights and improve the efficiency of data analysis at large.","(418, 17)","Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set

","This second part of a 2 volume-expertise is mainly based on the results of the inventory described in the first part. It is also based on a ""worrying"" statement in the terms of reference of this expert report 1, which states that ""Asia enjoys a favourable technological context [in terms of equipment according to UN statistics]. Nevertheless, digital technology is still hardly present in the practices of the member institutions of the Agency and the francophone university community; So distance education is not well developed: there are currently no French-language distance training courses offered by an establishment in Asia; The region has only 14 enrolled in ODL over the period 2010 - 2014; Only three institutions have responded to the AUF's ""Mooc"" calls for projects over the last two years, etc."". The terms of reference also indicate a state of deficiency ""in the Francophone digital campuses whose officials explain that the computer equipment are less and less used for individual practices"". The proliferation of mobile digital technologies that would normally constitute an important asset for the development of teaching practices and innovative research around the Francophone digital campuses has not lived up to expectations. The paper refers to another no less important detail that would explain the paradox between the proliferation of technological tools and the reduction in usage when it indicates that, in parallel, and contrary to the francophone campuses, In English a positive dynamics of integration of T ICE and distance"". The document provides concrete examples, such as the ASEAN Cyber University (ACU) program run by South Korea and its e-learning centers in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar, The Vietnamese language and the fablab set up in the region since 2014 without the Francophonie being involved. A first hypothesis emerges from this premonitory observation that it is not technology that justifies the gradual demobilization (or even demotivation) of local actors to establish forms of Francophone partnerships for training and research. Nor is it a question of political will to improve technological infrastructure in digital training and research.

Almost all the interviews carried out within the framework of this mission demonstrated the convergence of views and ambitious attitudes expressed by three categories of actors encountered:- political actors met in the ministries of education of the three countries who are aware of the importance of digital education and the added value generated by technologies for education. Each of the three countries has a regulatory framework and national technological innovation projects for education and digital education;- public and private academic institutions which, through their rectors, presidents and technical and pedagogical leaders, demonstrate their profound convictions for digital education (for reasons of quality, competitiveness and economic interest).

However, given the rather centralized governance model at state level, the majority of academic institutions in the three countries are often awaiting the promulgation of legal texts (decrees, charters, conventions, directives , Etc.) that enable them to act and adopt innovative solutions in teaching and research;- Teacher-researchers relatively little consulted in this expertise, but sufficiently engaged as actors on the ground to be able to predict their points of view with regard to the use of digital in their pedagogical and research activities. Teachers and researchers with relatively modest incomes would inevitably have a decisive role in any academic reform on the digital level if concrete mobilizing arguments could compensate for their shortfalls by joining digital training or development projects or programs.","(631, 14)","This research paper explores the potential of distance learning and digital tools for higher education and research in the Asia-Pacific region, specifically focusing on Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The second part of this paper presents a set of recommendations and a roadmap for implementing these technologies in these countries.

The first recommendation is to invest in infrastructure that supports digital learning. This includes building robust networks, providing access to digital devices, and training teachers and students on how to use these tools effectively. Governments and universities must collaborate to make these resources widely available.

The second recommendation is to create and curate high-quality digital content. Textbooks, lectures, and other learning materials should be developed or adapted for digital formats, and made available online for free or at a low cost. Collaboration between institutions can help pool resources and reduce duplication of effort.

The third recommendation is to develop interactive and collaborative learning tools. These tools can help students engage with course materials and with each other, even when they are studying remotely. This can include videoconferencing software, social media platforms, and online discussion forums.

The fourth recommendation is to ensure that the development of digital learning tools is based on research and best practices. This includes evaluating the effectiveness of different tools and approaches, and using this information to improve their design and implementation. Research should also be conducted on the impact of digital learning on student outcomes.

The final recommendation is to foster a culture of innovation and collaboration. This includes creating spaces for experimentation and learning, and providing opportunities for educators and researchers to share their experiences and insights. Governments and universities must work together to support this culture.

To achieve these recommendations, a roadmap is proposed that outlines the necessary steps and timelines. This includes identifying key stakeholders and partners, setting up pilot projects, and scaling up successful initiatives. The roadmap also highlights potential challenges and risks that must be addressed, such as the need for adequate funding and the risk of unequal access to digital resources.

","CEA/IRFM is conducting R\&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the 5 GHz ITER LHCD system, which is expected to transmit 20 MW of RF power to the plasma. Two 5 GHz 500 kW BeO pill-box type window prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company, in close collaboration with CEA/IRFM. Both windows have been validated at low power, showing good agreement between measured and modeling, with a return loss better than 32 dB and an insertion loss below 0.05 dB. This paper reports on the window RF design and the low power measurements. The high power tests up to 500kW have been carried out in March 2013 in collaboration with NFRI. Results of these tests are also reported. In the current ITER LHCD design, 20 MW Continuous Wave (CW) of Radio-Frequency power at 5 GHz are expected to be generated and transmitted to the plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat waveguide pressure, forty eight 5 GHz 500kW CW windows are to be assembled on the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, forty eight additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate and monitor the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line pressure. These windows are identified as being one of the main critical components for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies [1] [2] [3] or more recently [4] [5] , and clearly require an important R\&D effort. In this context and even if the LHCD system is not part of the construction baseline, the CEA/IRFM is conducting a R\&D effort in order to validate a design and the performances of these RF windows. In order to begin the assessment of this need, two 5 GHz 500 kW/5 s pill-box type windows prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company in close collaboration with the CEA/IRFM [6]. The section 2 of this paper reports the RF and mechanical design of a 5 GHz window. Some features of the mechanical design and the experimental RF measurements at low power are reported in section 3. High power results, made in collaboration with NFRI, are detailed in section 4. The development of CW windows is discussed in the conclusion. 2-RF AND MECHANICAL DESIGN The proposed 5 GHz RF window is based on a pill-box design [2] , i.e. a ceramic brazed in portion of a circular waveguide, connected on either side to a rectangular waveguide section. Typical design rules of thumb of such device are circular section diameter about the same size of the diagonal of the rectangular waveguide (cf. FIGURE 1). Without taking into account the ceramic, the circular section length is approximately half a guided wavelength of the circular TE 11 mode, in order for the device to act as a half-wave transformer.

Once optimized, taking into account the ceramic, matching is correct only for a narrow band of frequency and is very sensitive to the device dimensions and the ceramic relative permittivity. The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be extracted by an active water cooling, depends on the inside electric field topology and of ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent). Undesirable modes due to parasitic resonances can be excited in the ceramic volume, raising the electric field and","(624, 24)","The development of next-generation fusion reactors, such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), requires the use of high power sources to generate and sustain plasma. The Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system is one such high-energy source that is designed to provide steady-state current drive for fusion reactor operation. In order to achieve this, the LHCD system requires a high-power window capable of transmitting RF power to the plasma.

This paper describes the design and RF measurements of a 5 GHz 500 kW window for the ITER LHCD system. The goal of this research was to develop an optimized design for the window that would meet the stringent requirements of the LHCD system, while also providing reliable and efficient operation. The window design was based on a number of key factors, including the transmission properties of the materials, the need for high power handling capability, and the thermal management of the structure.

Simulations were used to optimize the design of the window, and several prototypes were fabricated to investigate the performance of the design under a variety of conditions. RF measurements were taken on the prototypes to determine their transmission properties and to verify that they met the requirements of the LHCD system. The results of these measurements revealed that the window design was able to meet all of the high-power requirements of the ITER LHCD system.

The research also investigated the thermal behavior of the window during operation, using simulations and experimental measurements. The results showed that the thermal management of the window was critical to its performance, as high-power RF transmission caused significant heating of the window. The simulations and experiments showed that effective cooling of the window was necessary to maintain reliable and efficient operation.

In conclusion, this paper presents the design and RF measurements of a 5 GHz 500 kW window for the ITER LHCD system. The research demonstrated the feasibility of the window design, and provided important insights into the challenges associated with high-power RF transmission and thermal management. The results of this research will be useful in the development of next-generation fusion reactors, as they will help to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of the LHCD system.","(397, 15)","CEA/IRFM is conducting R\&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor's (ITER) Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD)
system. One of these components is a 5 GHz, 500 kW window that will be used to transmit
microwaves from the gyrotron to the plasma. In this paper, we present the design and RF
measurements of this window.
The window is designed to operate at a frequency of 5 GHz and a power level of 500 kW. It
consists of a dielectric layer sandwiched between two metallic layers. The dielectric layer is
made of alumina (Al2O3), which has a high dielectric constant and a low loss tangent. The
metallic layers are made of copper, which has a high electrical conductivity and a low
resistivity. The thickness of the dielectric layer is 0.5 mm, while the thickness of the metallic
layers is 0.1 mm.
The window was fabricated using a combination of machining and chemical etching. The
dielectric layer was machined to the desired shape and size using a computer numerical
control (CNC) milling machine. The metallic layers were chemically etched using a solution
of ferric chloride (FeCl3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). The etching process was carefully
controlled to ensure that the thickness of the layers was uniform and within the specified
tolerances.
The RF measurements of the window were performed using a vector network analyzer (VNA).
The VNA was connected to the input and output ports of the window using coaxial cables. The
S-parameters of the window were measured at different frequencies and power levels. The
results showed that the window had a low insertion loss (less than 0.1 dB) and a high return
loss (greater than 20 dB) over the entire frequency range of interest. The window also had a
low phase shift (less than 5 degrees) and a high isolation (greater than 30 dB) between the
input and output ports.
Based on these results, we conclude that the window meets the requirements for the ITER
LHCD system. It has a low insertion loss, a high return loss, a low phase shift, and a high
isolation. It is also robust and reliable, as it can withstand high power levels and harsh
environmental conditions. We believe that this window will play a critical role in the success
of the ITER project.","[(442, 21)]","CEA/IRFM is conducting R\&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the

tokamak in order to heat and confine the plasma.
In this paper, we present the design of a 500 kW, 5 GHz window for the LHCD system, and the
results of its RF measurements. The window is based on a 2.5 m long, 1.5 m wide, and 0.5 m
thick aluminum plate. The window has a 0.2 mm thick, 0.3 mm wide, 1 mm deep, and 1 mm wide
rectangular hole in the center of the plate. The hole is surrounded by 0.1 mm thick aluminum
plates on both sides of the hole.
The window is designed to operate at 5 GHz with a power level of 500 kW. The window was
measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA). The VNA was used to measure the reflection
coefficient of the window at 5.2 GHz, 5.4 GHz, and 5.6 GHz. The VNA also measured the
impedance of the window.
The results of the measurements show that the window has a reflection coefficient of less
than -10 dB at all three frequencies. The impedance of the window is less than 50 ohms at all
three frequencies. The results indicate that the window is suitable for use in the LHCD
system.","[(284, 14)]"

Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron
","Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron to centimeter size. Meteorites are evidence that individual grains of those sizes were collected and assembled into planetesimals in the young solar system. Aims. We assess the efficiency of dust collection of a swarm of non-drifting planetesimals {\rev with radii ranging from 1 to $10^3$\,km and beyond. Methods. We calculate the collision probability of dust drifting in the disk due to gas drag by planetesimal accounting for several regimes depending on the size of the planetesimal, dust, and orbital distance: the geometric, Safronov, settling, and three-body regimes. We also include a hydrodynamical regime to account for the fact that small grains tend to be carried by the gas flow around planetesimals. Results. We provide expressions for the collision probability of dust by planetesimals and for the filtering efficiency by a swarm of planetesimals. For standard turbulence conditions (i.e., a turbulence parameter $\alpha=10^{-2}$), filtering is found to be inefficient, meaning that when crossing a minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) belt of planetesimals extending between 0.1 AU and 35 AU most dust particles are eventually accreted by the central star rather than colliding with planetesimals. However, if the disk is weakly turbulent ($\alpha=10^{-4}$) filtering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all smaller than about 10 km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in the geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km in size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller than one tenth of the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case most collisions take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very different properties: we find that the local filtering efficiency $x_{filter,MMSN}$ scales with $r^{-7/4}$ (where $r$ is the orbital distance) in the geometric regime, but with $r^{-1/4}$ to $r^{1/4}$ in the settling regime.

This implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur close to the central star and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the other hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling regime is expected to be more gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust particles much smaller than millimeter size tend only to be captured by the smallest planetesimals because they otherwise move on gas streamlines and their collisions take place in the hydrodynamical regime. Conclusions. Our results hint at an inside-out formation of planetesimals in the infant solar system because small planetesimals in the geometrical limit can filter dust much more efficiently close to the central star. However, even a fully-formed belt of planetesimals such as the MMSN only marginally captures inward-drifting dust and this seems to imply that dust in the protosolar disk has been filtered by planetesimals even smaller than 1 km (not included in this study) or that it has been assembled into planetesimals by other mechanisms (e.g., orderly growth, capture into vortexes). Further refinement of our work concerns, among other things: a quantitative description of the transition region between the hydro and settling regimes; an assessment of the role of disk turbulence for collisions, in particular in the hydro regime; and the coupling of our model to a planetesimal formation model.","(646, 20)","This research paper explores the mechanisms of dust filtering and processing in planetesimals, specifically focusing on non-drifting planetesimals. The collision probabilities for such planetesimals were derived and analyzed to illuminate their impacts on the filtration and processing of dust. These collision probabilities were analyzed through numerical simulations, which incorporated varied parameters such as planetesimal radius and density as well as dust particle size and distribution.


The results of the analysis show that non-drifting planetesimals play a significant role in the early stages of planet formation through their ability to filter and process dust. Through collisions with dust particles, these planetesimals are able to both grow in size and remove debris from the surrounding environment. The effects of this filtering and processing are not only important for the planetesimal itself, but also relevant for later stages of planet formation when large bodies form through collisions of planetesimals.


The analytical framework and numerical simulations used in the research provide a foundation for future studies into the processes of dust filtering and processing by planetesimals. The collision probabilities derived for non-drifting planetesimals can be applied to other studies of planetesimal growth and dust filtration, improving our understanding of early stages of planetary formation.


An important implication of this research is that the mechanisms of dust filtration and processing by non-drifting planetesimals enable the successful formation of larger bodies like planets and asteroids, crucial to the evolution of our solar system and others. By examining these mechanisms, insights can be gained not only into the formation of planets, but also into the evolution of other celestial bodies throughout the universe.


In conclusion, this research paper provides a thorough analysis of the collision probabilities for non-drifting planetesimals and their impact on the processing and filtering of dust. The results show that non-drifting planetesimals play an important role in the early stages of planet formation through their ability to remove debris and grow in size. This research can improve our understanding of the formation of planets not only in our solar system, but throughout the universe as well. The analytical framework and numerical simulations used in this study provide a strong foundation for further research in this field.","(386, 14)","Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron
sized grains to pebbles up to several centimeters in size. These dust grains are thought to be
the building blocks of planetesimals and planets. However, the process by which dust grains
grow into planetesimals is not well understood. In this paper, we present a new model for the
growth of dust grains into planetesimals, which takes into account the effects of collisions
between dust grains and planetesimals. We show that collisions between dust grains and
planetesimals can lead to the formation of planetesimals, and we derive an expression for the
probability of a collision between a dust grain and a planetesimal.
Methodology. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to model the growth of dust grains into
planetesimals. We assume that the dust grains are distributed uniformly throughout the disk,
and that the planetesimals are randomly distributed throughout the disk. We also assume that
the planetesimals are spherical and have a uniform density. We use a random number generator
to determine the position and velocity of each dust grain and planetesimal, and we use a
collision detection algorithm to determine whether or not a collision occurs between a dust
grain and a planetesimal. If a collision occurs, we use a collision response algorithm to
determine the outcome of the collision.
Findings. We find that the probability of a dust grain colliding with a planetesimal is
proportional to the square of the relative velocity between the dust grain and the planetesimal,
and inversely proportional to the radius of the planetesimal. We also find that the probability
of a dust grain growing into a planetesimal is proportional to the cube of the radius of the
Implications. Our results have important implications for the formation of planets in
circumstellar disks. We show that dust grains can grow into planetesimals through collisions
with planetesimals. This suggests that planetesimals may play an important role in the
formation of planets in circumstellar disks. Our results also suggest that the growth of dust
grains into planetesimals may be a more efficient process than previously thought.","[(379, 19)]","Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron
grains to centimeter-sized particles. These dust grains are thought to originate from
planetesimals, which are believed to be the precursors of planets.

Question. What are the collision probabilities for planetesimal-planetesimal collisions?

Methodology. We used N-body simulations of planetesimal collisions to calculate the
collision probabilities between planetesimal and planetesimal dust grains.

Findings. We found that the collision probability between a planetesimal grain and
another planetesimal depends on the size of the planetesimal.

Implications. These collision probabilities can be used to estimate the amount of dust
grains in the circumstellar disk of a planet.","[(119, 11)]"

Stylolites are ubiquitous geo-patterns observed in rocks in the upper crust, from geological reservoirs in
","Stylolites are ubiquitous geo-patterns observed in rocks in the upper crust, from geological reservoirs in sedimentary rocks to deformation zones, in folds, faults, and shear zones. These rough surfaces play a major role in the dissolution of rocks around stressed contacts, the transport of dissolved material and the precipitation in surrounding pores. Consequently, they play an active role in the evolution of rock microstructures and rheological properties in the Earth's crust. They are observed individually or in networks, in proximity to fractures and joints, and in numerous geological settings. This review article deals with their geometrical and compositional characteristics and the factors leading to their genesis. The main questions this review focuses on are the following: How do they form? How can they be used to measure strain and formation stress? How do they control fluid flow in the upper crust?

Geometrically, stylolites have fractal roughness, with fractal geometrical properties exhibiting typically three scaling regimes: a self-affine scaling with Hurst exponent 1.1+/-0.1 at small scale (up to tens or hundreds of microns), another one with Hurst exponent around 0.5 to 0.6 at intermediate scale (up to millimeters or centimeters), and in the case of sedimentary stylolites, a flat scaling at large scale. More complicated anisotropic scaling (scaling laws depending of the direction of the profile considered) is found in the case of tectonic stylolites. We report models based on first principles from physical chemistry and statistical physics, including a mechanical component for the free-energy associated with stress concentrations, and a precise tracking of the influence of grain-scale heterogeneities and disorder on the resulting (micro)structures. Experimental efforts to reproduce stylolites in the laboratory are also reviewed. We show that although micrometer-size stylolite teeth are obtained in laboratory experiments, teeth deforming numerous grains have not yet been obtained experimentally, which is understandable given the very long formation time of such geometries. Finally, the applications of stylolites as strain and stress markers, to determine paleostress magnitude are reviewed. We show that the scalings in stylolite heights and the crossover scale between these scalings can be used to determine the stress magnitude (its scalar value) perpendicular to the stylolite surface during the stylolite formation, and that the stress anisotropy in the stylolite plane can be determined for the case of tectonic stylolites. We also show that the crossover between medium (millimetric) scales and large (pluricentimetric) scales, in the case of sedimentary stylolites, provides a good marker for the total amount of dissolution, which is still valid even when the largest teeth start to dissolve -- which leads to the loss of information, since the total deformation is not anymore recorded in a single marker structure. We discuss the impact of the stylolites on the evolution of the transport properties of the hosting rock, and show that they promote a permeability increase parallel to the stylolites, whereas their effect on the permeability transverse to the stylolite can be negligible, or may reduce the permeability, depending on the development of the stylolite.

Highlights: Stylolite formation depends on rock composition and structure, stress and fluids. Stylolite geometry, fractal and self-affine properties, network structure, are investigated. The experiments and physics-based numerical models for their formation are reviewed. Stylolites can be used as markers of strain, paleostress orientation and magnitude. Stylolites impact transport properties, as function of maturity and flow direction.","(627, 22)","Stylolites are a critical feature in sedimentary rocks, which have garnered significant interest over the years given their widespread occurrence and potential significance in several geological processes. In this review, we provide an extensive analysis of the literature available on stylolites, thereby enabling a better understanding of their behavior and formation mechanisms. First, we discuss the various historical perspectives on stylolites and the evolution of ideas explaining their formation. Subsequently, we delve into the current understanding of the physical and chemical processes that induce and animate stylolites. We highlight field and laboratory studies, alongside analytical techniques such as petrography, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe, and Raman spectroscopy, which have contributed significantly to the current state of knowledge on stylolites.

We further analyze the composition and mineralogy of stylolites with a discussion on their role in hydrocarbon exploration. We evaluate the interplay between mechanical and chemical compaction mechanisms in their formation and briefly examine some of the significant implications in reservoir quality assessments. We discuss how their presence can affect porosity, permeability, and ultimately oil recovery in underground reservoirs and provide a comprehensive review of the available literature on stylolites as a tool in hydrocarbon exploration. 

Furthermore, we expound on the association of stylolites with various geological phenomena, including deformation stress, fluid activity, and diagenesis. We examine the evidence of syn-sedimentary versus post-sedimentary origin of stylolites, which has significant implications for their interpretation and paleo-environmental reconstructions. The review offers insight into the potential use of stylolites in paleostress and paleohydrology analysis and their significance as proxies for burial depth. 

We conclude our review by discussing current controversies in the field of stylolites such as their mode of initiation, the extent of their influence on rock properties, and their role as deformation markers. Additionally, we highlight some of the gaps in current knowledge on stylolites and offer suggestions for future research areas.

Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to give
","Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to give H(2)O(2). Recently, the mutation of the Glu47 residue into alanine (E47A) in the active site of SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii has allowed the stabilization of an iron-peroxo species when quickly reacted with H(2)O(2) [Math{\'e} et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 4966-4967]. To further investigate this non-heme peroxo-iron species, we have carried out a M{\""o}ssbauer study of the (57)Fe-enriched E47A SOR from D. baarsii reacted quickly with H(2)O(2). Considering the M{\""o}ssbauer data, we conclude, in conjunction with the other spectroscopic data available and with the results of density functional calculations on related models, that this species corresponds to a high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) complex. This is one of the first examples of such a species in a biological system for which M{\""o}ssbauer parameters are now available: delta(/Fe) = 0.54 (1) mm/s, DeltaE(Q) = -0.80 (5) mm/s, and the asymmetry parameter eta = 0.60 (5) mm/s. The M{\""o}ssbauer and spin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on peroxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center in SOR from Pyrococcus furiosus, for which structural data are available in the literature [Yeh et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2499-2508]. For comparison, similar calculations have been carried out on a model derived from 2 (model 3), where the [CH(3)-S](1)(-) group has been replaced by the neutral [NH(3)](0) group [Neese and Solomon (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12829-12848]. Both models 2 and 3 contain a formally high-spin Fe(3+) ion (i.e., with empty minority spin orbitals). We found, however, a significant fraction (approximately 0.6 for 2, approximately 0.8 for 3) of spin (equivalently charge) spread over two occupied (minority spin) orbitals. The quadrupole splitting value for 2 is found to be negative and matches quite well the experimental value. The computed quadrupole tensors are rhombic in the case of 2 and axial in the case of 3. This difference originates directly from the presence of the thiolate ligand in 2. A correlation between experimental isomer shifts for Fe(3+) mononuclear complexes with computed electron densities at the iron nucleus has been built and used to evaluate the isomer shift values for 2 and 3 (0.56 and 0.63 mm/s, respectively). A significant increase of isomer shift value is found upon going from a methylthiolate to a nitrogen ligand for the Fe(3+) ion, consistent with covalency effects due to the presence of the axial thiolate ligand. Considering that the isomer shift value for 3 is likely to be in the 0.61-0.65 mm/s range [Horner et al. (2002) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 3278-3283], the isomer shift value for a high-spin eta(2)-O(2) Fe(3+) complex with an axial thiolate group can be estimated to be in the 0.54-0.58 mm/s range. The occurrence of a side-on peroxo intermediate in SOR is discussed in relation to the recent data published for a side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) species in another biological system [Karlsson et al.

(2003) Science 299, 1039-1042].","(694, 30)","In this study, we focus on the M{\""o}ssbauer characterization of an unusual high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe3+ species in the active site of superoxide reductase from Desulfoarculus Baarsii and complement our findings with density functional calculations on related models. Our investigation sheds light on the structure and properties of this particular peroxo-Fe3+ species, with implications for elucidating the mechanism of superoxide reduction by this enzyme. 

Our M{\""o}ssbauer spectroscopy measurements reveal the presence of a high-spin Fe3+ center in the peroxo species, which exhibits an unusual side-on binding mode. This finding is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which predict a high-spin, side-on peroxo-Fe3+ species as the most stable configuration. Our theoretical calculation of the M{\""o}ssbauer spectrum of the proposed side-on peroxo-Fe3+ species shows good agreement with the experimental spectrum. 

Additionally, we investigate the effect of various ligands on the stability and electronic properties of the peroxo species using DFT. Our calculations indicate that specific ligands, such as imidazole, can have a significant impact on the electronic structure of the peroxo-Fe3+ center. We also investigate the reactivity of the peroxo species towards superoxide, using DFT to calculate the activation barriers for the reaction. Our results suggest that the high-spin, side-on peroxo-Fe3+ species is a likely intermediate for the reduction of superoxide by the enzyme.

Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive
","Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive reasoning. This is so because there are general and definite rules for the change of subjective probabilities through information or experience; induction and belief change are one and same topic, after all. The most basic of these rules is simply to conditionalize with respect to the information received; and there are similar and more general rules. 1 Hence, a fundamental reason for the epistemological success of probability theory is that there at all exists a well-behaved concept of conditional probability. Still, people have, and have reasons for, various concerns over probability theory. One of these is my starting point: Intuitively, we have the notion of plain belief; we believe propositions2 to be true (or to be false or neither). Probability theory, however, offers no formal counterpart to this notion. Believing A is not the same as having probability 1 for A, because probability 1 is incorrigible3; but plain belief is clearly corrigible. And believing A is not the same as giving A a probability larger than some 1 - c, because believing A and believing B is usually taken to be equivalent to believing A & B.4 Thus, it seems that the formal representation of plain belief has to take a non-probabilistic route. Indeed, representing plain belief seems easy enough: simply represent an epistemic state by the set of all propositions believed true in it or, since I make the common assumption that plain belief is deductively closed, by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it. But this does not yet provide a theory of induction, i.e.

an answer to the question how epistemic states so represented are changed tbrough information or experience. There is a convincing partial answer: if the new information is compatible with the old epistemic state, then the new epistemic state is simply represented by the conjunction of the new information and the old beliefs. This answer is partial because it does not cover the quite common case where the new information is incompatible with the old beliefs. It is, however, important to complete the answer and to cover this case, too; otherwise, we would not represent plain belief as conigible. The crucial problem is that there is no good completion. When epistemic states are represented simply by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it, the answer cannot be completed; and though there is a lot of fruitful work, no other representation of epistemic states has been proposed, as far as I know, which provides a complete solution to this problem. In this paper, I want to suggest such a solution. In [4], I have more fully argued that this is the only solution, if certain plausible desiderata are to be satisfied. Here, in section 2, I will be content with formally defining and intuitively explaining my proposal. I will compare my proposal with probability theory in section 3. It will turn out that the theory I am proposing is structurally homomorphic to probability theory in important respects and that it is thus equally easily implementable, but moreover computationally simpler. Section 4 contains a very brief comparison with various kinds of logics, in particular conditional logic, with Shackle's functions of potential surprise and related theories, and with the Dempster - Shafer theory of belief functions.","(632, 23)","Inductive reasoning plays a vital role in scientific inquiry by enabling the inference of conclusions from empirical data. Despite its significance, there exist fundamental challenges in explicating the foundations of inductive reasoning. In particular, traditional approaches have used probabilistic frameworks as the primary tool for modeling inductive reasoning. However, this approach has limited application in real-life scenarios, and even fails to provide an adequate explanation for phenomena that involve non-probabilistic or correlated uncertainties. In this paper, we introduce a general non-probabilistic theory of inductive reasoning, which offers a fresh perspective on traditional models of reasoning. Our theory considers inductive reasoning as a process of developing theories about the causal structure of a given phenomenon, and seeks to provide a systematic framework for this process. Our approach considers the problem of inductive reasoning as part of a larger context of decision-making under uncertainty, and utilizes tools from causal inference, game theory, and information theory.

Through the lens of our theory, we can better understand and formalize the process of inductive reasoning. Specifically, we articulate a new framework that identifies the causal structure of a given phenomenon as the key element for making sound inductive inferences, and further explore how this structure can be uncovered. Our framework is founded on the idea that inductive reasoning can be viewed as a game between the reasoner and nature, and that the optimal strategy in this game requires an analysis of the causal structure. We then introduce a new class of models that capture non-probabilistic uncertainties and are well-defined within this framework. These models are shown to be as versatile as probabilistic models in describing inductive reasoning, and in fact, can better capture the nuances of non-probabilistic uncertainties.

Overall, the proposed non-probabilistic theory of inductive reasoning offers a new approach to model and solve complicated inductive inference problems. It leverages advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence to bring us one step closer to achieving a more general understanding of inductive reasoning. We conclude by highlighting some future directions for research, including the challenges in developing new methodologies and applications for the principle of inductive inference. Ultimately, this work is a stepping stone towards deeper insights into the fundamental question of how we do science and build theories in the face of uncertainty.","(413, 16)","Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive

probabilistic accounts of inductive reasoning in several ways. First, GNTIR is more general than probabilistic
accounts of inductive reasoning because it does not require the assumption that the world is probabilistic. Second,
GNTIR is more parsimonious than probabilistic accounts of induction because it requires fewer assumptions about
the nature of the world. Third, GNTIR has greater explanatory power than probabilistic theories of induction
because it can explain a wider range of inductive phenomena. Finally, GNTIR offers a more satisfying account of
inductive reasoning than probabilistic theories because it does not suffer from the same problems as probabilistic
theories. In particular, GNTIR does not face the problem of logical omniscience, which is a major problem for
probabilistic theories of induction. Overall, we believe that GNTIR provides a superior account of inductive","[(201, 10)]","Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive

In this section, the author introduces the idea of IBE and explains how it can be used to solve the problem of induction.
The problem of induction is the problem of explaining how we can know that the future will be like the past.
There are two main approaches to solving this problem: the inductive approach and the deductive approach.
The inductive approach argues that we can know the future is like the past because we have observed that the past is like the
future.
The deductive approach, on the other hand, argues that we cannot know the future because we have not observed that the
past is like the future.
Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages.
