This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes
","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes equations. The thesis is divided in four independent chapters.The first chapter involves a rigorous discussion about the energy's dissipation law, proposed by theory of the turbulence K41, in the deterministic setting of the homogeneous and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with a stationary external force (the force only depends of the spatial variable) and on the whole space R3. The energy's dissipation law, also called the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, characterizes the energy's dissipation rate (in the form of heat) of a turbulent fluid and this law was developed by A.N.

Kolmogorov in 1941. However, its deduction (which uses mainly tools of statistics) is not fully understood until our days and then an active research area consists in studying this law in the rigorous framework of the Navier-Stokes equations which describe in a mathematical way the fluids motion and in particular the movement of turbulent fluids. In this setting, the purpose of this chapter is to highlight the fact that if we consider the Navier-Stokes equations on R3 then certain physical quantities, necessary for the study of the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, have no a rigorous definition and then to give a sense to these quantities we suggest to consider the Navier-Stokes equations with an additional damping term. In the framework of these damped equations, we obtain some estimates for the energy's dissipation rate according to the Kolmogorov's dissipation law.In the second chapter we are interested in study the stationary solutions of the damped Navier- Stokes introduced in the previous chapter. These stationary solutions are a particular type of solutions which do not depend of the temporal variable and their study is motivated by the fact that we always consider the Navier-Stokes equations with a stationary external force. In this chapter we study two properties of the stationary solutions : the first property concerns the stability of these solutions where we prove that if we have a control on the external force then all non stationary solution (with depends of both spatial and temporal variables) converges toward a stationary solution. The second property concerns the decay in spatial variable of the stationary solutions. These properties of stationary solutions are a consequence of the damping term introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations.In the third chapter we still study the stationary solutions of Navier-Stokes equations but now we consider the classical equations (without any additional damping term). The purpose of this chapter is to study an other problem related to the deterministic description of the turbulence : the frequency decay of the stationary solutions. Indeed, according to the K41 theory, if the fluid is in a laminar setting then the stationary solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations must exhibit a exponential frequency decay which starts at lows frequencies. But, if the fluid is in a turbulent setting then this exponential frequency decay must be observed only at highs frequencies. In this chapter, using some Fourier analysis tools, we give a precise description of this exponential frequency decay in the laminar and in the turbulent setting.In the fourth and last chapter we return to the stationary solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations and we study the uniqueness of these solutions in the particular case without any external force. Following some ideas of G. Seregin, we study the uniqueness of these solutions first in the framework of Lebesgue spaces of and then in the a general framework of Morrey spaces.","(624, 16)","The Navier-Stokes equations provide a fundamental framework for understanding the behavior of fluids in a wide range of applications. One phenomenon that is crucial to explaining such behavior is the turbulence that fluids exhibit. Turbulence is a complex, dynamic process that has resisted detailed analytical investigation due to its highly nonlinear nature. Instead, researchers often rely on numerical simulations, which in turn demand accurate and efficient models for describing turbulence. 

This paper presents a thorough overview of deterministic descriptions of turbulence within the realm of Navier-Stokes equations. By focusing on the use of deterministic models, we aim to better understand the nature of turbulence, how it arises, and how it can be controlled or harnessed for practical purposes. The need for such models is pressing, as they can be used to improve the design of fluid-based technologies, such as naval vessels, aircraft, and wind turbines, among others.

The main body of the paper is divided into several sections that cover different aspects of deterministic descriptions of turbulence. The first section introduces the Navier-Stokes equations and provides a brief overview of their solution. The second section then delves into deterministic models of turbulence, starting with a basic introduction to the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence and moving on to more advanced models. In particular, we investigate models based on the concepts of eddies and energy cascades, as well as models that use multiscale approaches to capture the range of phenomena that turbulence can exhibit.

In the third section of the paper, we turn our attention to numerical simulations of turbulence. We describe the use of high-performance computing and sophisticated algorithms to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, while titrating the advantages and limitations of various numerical methods. We then proceed to describe how deterministic descriptions of turbulence can be integrated into numerical simulations for optimal performance and predictive capabilities. 

The final section of the paper discusses some of the key challenges facing the field in the coming years. These include the need for more efficient and accurate models, the development of novel simulation techniques, and the integration of experimental data to improve model prediction. We conclude by highlighting some of the potential applications of deterministic models of turbulence to industrial processes, environmental studies, and even astrophysics.

Overall, this paper presents an in-depth review of deterministic descriptions of turbulence in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the nature of turbulence and the tools necessary to control it. It is our hope that this work will help to shape future research in this important and challenging area of physics.","(489, 20)","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes
equations. The main goal of this work is to understand the mechanism of the transition from
the laminar flow to the turbulent one and to describe the properties of the developed
turbulence. In order to achieve this goal, we use the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the
Navier-Stokes equations. This method allows us to obtain the exact solution of the equations
and to study the properties of the flow in detail.
The first part of the thesis is devoted to the study of the transition from the laminar flow to
the turbulent one. We use the linear stability analysis to determine the critical Reynolds
number at which the laminar flow becomes unstable. We then use the DNS to study the
development of the instability and the transition to turbulence. We find that the transition
occurs through a series of bifurcations and that the final state of the flow depends on the
initial conditions.
In the second part of the thesis, we focus on the study of the developed turbulence. We use
the DNS to obtain the statistical properties of the flow, such as the mean velocity, the
turbulent kinetic energy, and the Reynolds stress. We also study the structure of the flow,
such as the vortices and the coherent structures. We find that these structures play an
important role in the dynamics of the flow and that they are responsible for the transfer of
energy from the large scales to the small scales.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of the turbulence in
the Navier- Stokes equations. We conclude that the DNS is a powerful tool for the
deterministic study of the turbulence and that it can provide valuable insights into the
properties of the flow.","(329, 14)","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes

Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is
","Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of multivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular, the diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite naturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum Parsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the analyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve the major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their discretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an unsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction How do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform themselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to present-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout the Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between these, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract some digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is classification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From images obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his observations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter (the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four categories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the famous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these classes, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been refined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global classification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by Hubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used to represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the Hubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can be understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations found between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one must admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble classification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the most obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate, qualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to characterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant multivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since the year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble classification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble classification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet emerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate analyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling the observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar clusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant objects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our present day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.

Astrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in astrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum Parsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new exploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \& Fraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a larger number of objects must now be analysed. In this paper, I","(680, 35)","Clustering is a widely used technique in astrophysics to study celestial objects and their properties. However, traditional clustering approaches often fall short in properly accounting for the complex evolutionary relationships between objects, especially those involving large-scale astrophysical phenomena. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the use of phylogenetic tools in clustering analyses in order to better understand the underlying evolutionary processes governing celestial objects in astrophysical systems.

We begin by introducing the fundamentals of phylogenetics and how it can be applied to astrophysics. We describe the concept of a ""phylogenetic tree"" which captures the hypothesized evolutionary relationships between celestial objects based on their observable traits and characteristics. By constructing these phylogenetic trees, we can gain insights into the evolutionary processes that govern these objects and how they may have evolved over time.

We then discuss how these phylogenetic tools can be incorporated into clustering analyses. We introduce a novel method for constructing phylogenetic distance matrices, which can be used as input into traditional clustering algorithms. By utilizing these distance matrices, we can cluster celestial objects based not only on their observable traits, but also on their evolutionary relationships, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical systems.

We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study of a large-scale simulation of galaxy formation and evolution. We show that the use of phylogenetic-based clustering leads to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history of galaxies within the simulation. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be used to identify ""outlier"" objects that may have unique evolutionary histories or properties.

Finally, we discuss the potential applications of phylogenetic-based clustering in future astrophysical research. We highlight the usefulness of this approach in studying diverse astrophysical systems, including stars, planets, and even entire galaxies. We also propose potential extensions to our method, such as incorporating additional sources of data or refining the phylogenetic analyses themselves.

In conclusion, this paper showcases the power of using phylogenetic tools in clustering analyses within astrophysics. By accounting for the complex evolutionary relationships between celestial objects, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical systems and their properties. We hope that this paper serves as a starting point for future research into the application of phylogenetics within astrophysics and beyond.","(417, 18)","Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is
one such field where phylogenetic methods have been successfully applied. In this paper, we explore the use of
phylogenetic tools for clustering in astrophysics. We first introduce the concept of phylogenetic trees and how
they can be used for clustering. We then present a case study where we apply phylogenetic methods to cluster
galaxies based on their physical properties. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and suggest
future directions for research in this area.
Phylogenetic trees are graphical representations of evolutionary relationships between organisms. They are
constructed by comparing the DNA or protein sequences of different organisms and inferring the evolutionary
relationships based on the similarities and differences in these sequences. Phylogenetic trees can be used for
clustering because they provide a natural way to group together organisms that are more closely related to each
other than to other organisms.
In our case study, we used phylogenetic trees to cluster galaxies based on their stellar masses, star formation
rates, and metallicities. We found that galaxies with similar physical properties tend to cluster together in the
phylogenetic tree. For example, galaxies with high stellar masses and low star formation rates tend to cluster
together in one branch of the tree, while galaxies with low stellar masses and high star formation rates tend
to cluster together in another branch of the tree. These results suggest that phylogenetic methods can be used
to identify groups of galaxies with similar physical characteristics.
The implications of our findings are significant for astrophysics. By using phylogenetic methods, we can gain a
deeper understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe. For example, we can use phylogenetic
methods to study the formation and evolution of galaxies, as well as the distribution of dark matter in the
universe. Additionally, phylogenetic methods may also be useful for studying other phenomena in astrophysics,
such as the formation of black holes and the origin of life.
In conclusion, we have shown that phylogenetic tools can be successfully applied to clustering in
astrophysics. Our case study demonstrates the potential of phylogenetic methods for studying the structure and
evolution of the universe. We hope that our work will inspire further research in this area and lead to new
discoveries in astrophysics.","(419, 20)","Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is

","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the value of the statistic statistically significant or nonsignificant on the bases of a P value derived from a null-hypothesis test.

Taking into account that studies are manly conducted in sample, the use of null hypothesis testing only allows estimating the true values (population) of the statistics used. However, evidence has grown in many areas of knowledge that this approach often leads to confusion and misinterpretation. To overcome this limitation they have recently emerged recommendations to support the statistical analysis with approaches that make use of more intuitive interpretations and more practical, especially based on the magnitudes (certainty / uncertainty) of the true values found. With the intent to provide alternative solutions to methodological designs recurrently used in research in sports sciences, this paper will seek to i) briefly spell out some of the weaknesses associated with the null hypothesis tests based in the P value; ii) reflect on the implications of the use of practical/clinical significance as opposed to statistical significance; iii) submit proposals for use the inferences based on the magnitude, particularly in the visualization and interpretation of results; iv) present and discuss the limitations of magnitude-based inference. Thus, this update article discourages, in a sustained-based, the use of significance tests based only on the concept of null hypothesis. Alternatively, it is proposed to use methods of inference based on magnitudes as they allow interpretations of the practical/clinical effects results obtained.","(274, 7)","The use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has been widely criticized in the field of sports science, leading to the call for alternative statistical methods that can offer better insight into the magnitude of effects. Inferential statistics based on magnitude-based inferences (MBI) have emerged as a promising alternative to NHST for investigating sports-related research questions.

MBI offers the possibility of quantifying the magnitude of differences between groups or treatments, rather than simply testing for statistically significant differences. This approach provides researchers with a more meaningful interpretation of their results and can ultimately lead to more informed conclusions that are relevant to practitioners and athletes alike.

The need to move away from NHST is not only due to its limitations in providing meaningful results, but also because of its reliance on arbitrary thresholds (e.g., a p-value of 0.05) that do not necessarily reflect the strength and importance of the observed effects. In contrast, MBI uses a statistical approach that is based on the estimation of effect sizes and their confidence intervals, enabling a more nuanced interpretation of the findings. 

Moreover, MBI can also mitigate problems associated with small sample sizes, which are common in sports science research. By focusing on effect size rather than the p-value, MBI can provide more stable and reliable estimates of the true population effect, even when working with small sample sizes.

MBI also offers advantages over other approaches, such as Bayesian statistics, in terms of its simplicity, ease of interpretation, and its potential to improve scientific communication. By adopting MBI, researchers and practitioners in sports science can overcome some of the limitations of NHST and obtain more meaningful and informative results.

In conclusion, the use of MBI in the investigation of sports-related research questions is becoming increasingly popular. MBI offers a more meaningful and informative approach to statistical inference, which can ultimately lead to more informed conclusions and practical implications for athletes and practitioners. The scientific community should continue to embrace and explore the potential of MBI as a valuable alternative to NHST in sports science research.","(378, 13)","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the

conventional methods and explore alternative approaches. This paper aims to shed light on the
importance of breaking away from null hypothesis testing and the use of p-values in sports science
research. By doing so, we hope to contribute to a more robust and reliable body of knowledge in
this field.

Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set
","Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. A $k$-dimensional box is a Cartesian product of closed intervals $[a_1,b_1]\times [a_2,b_2]\times...\times [a_k,b_k]$. The {\it boxicity} of $G$, $\boxi(G)$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ can be represented as the intersection graph of $k$-dimensional boxes, i.e. each vertex is mapped to a $k$-dimensional box and two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and only if their corresponding boxes intersect. Let $\poset=(S,P)$ be a poset where $S$ is the ground set and $P$ is a reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive binary relation on $S$. The dimension of $\poset$, $\dim(\poset)$ is the minimum integer $t$ such that $P$ can be expressed as the intersection of $t$ total orders. Let $G_\poset$ be the \emph{underlying comparability graph} of $\poset$, i.e. $S$ is the vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are comparable in $\poset$. It is a well-known fact that posets with the same underlying comparability graph have the same dimension. The first result of this paper links the dimension of a poset to the boxicity of its underlying comparability graph. In particular, we show that for any poset $\poset$, $\boxi(G_\poset)/(\chi(G_\poset)-1) \le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$, where $\chi(G_\poset)$ is the chromatic number of $G_\poset$ and $\chi(G_\poset)\ne1$. It immediately follows that if $\poset$ is a height-2 poset, then $\boxi(G_\poset)\le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ since the underlying comparability graph of a height-2 poset is a bipartite graph. The second result of the paper relates the boxicity of a graph $G$ with a natural partial order associated with the \emph{extended double cover} of $G$, denoted as $G_c$: Note that $G_c$ is a bipartite graph with partite sets $A$ and $B$ which are copies of $V(G)$ such that corresponding to every $u\in V(G)$, there are two vertices $u_A\in A$ and $u_B\in B$ and $\{u_A,v_B\}$ is an edge in $G_c$ if and only if either $u=v$ or $u$ is adjacent to $v$ in $G$. Let $\poset_c$ be the natural height-2 poset associated with $G_c$ by making $A$ the set of minimal elements and $B$ the set of maximal elements. We show that $\frac{\boxi(G)}{2} \le \dim(\poset_c) \le 2\boxi(G)+4$. These results have some immediate and significant consequences. The upper bound $\dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ allows us to derive hitherto unknown upper bounds for poset dimension such as $\dim(\poset)\le 2\tw(G_\poset)+4$, since boxicity of any graph is known to be at most its $\tw+2$. In the other direction, using the already known bounds for partial order dimension we get the following: (1) The boxicity of any graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ is $O(\Delta\log^2\Delta)$ which is an improvement over the best known upper bound of $\Delta^2+2$. (2) There exist graphs with boxicity $\Omega(\Delta\log\Delta)$. This disproves a conjecture that the boxicity of a graph is $O(\Delta)$. (3) There exists no polynomial-time algorithm to approximate the boxicity of a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with a factor of $O(n^{0.5-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$, unless $NP=ZPP$.","(798, 21)","Boxicity and Poset Dimension are two closely related concepts in combinatorial optimization that have recently received extensive attention. Boxicity refers to the smallest integer k such that a graph can be represented as the intersection graph of k-dimensional axis-aligned boxes. Poset Dimension, on the other hand, measures the smallest number of linear extensions required to represent a partially ordered set (poset). While seemingly distinct, recent research has shown that these two concepts are closely related, and understanding one can give insight into the other.

The study of these two concepts has important practical applications in fields such as scheduling, logistics, and VLSI layout design. For example, in scheduling applications, boxicity can be used to construct scheduling models based on resource constraints where the resources have different capacities. These models are used in a variety of industries, such as manufacturing and transportation, to optimize the use of resources and increase efficiency.

In the past few decades, much research has been devoted to the algorithmic aspects of Boxicity and Poset Dimension. Algorithms have been developed to compute the boxicity and the poset dimension of a given graph, which have found applications in data analysis and optimization. Additionally, several linear time algorithms have been developed to compute the poset dimension of certain classes of posets such as grid posets.

Despite these algorithmic advances, there are still many open problems related to Boxicity and Poset Dimension. One such problem is determining the relationship between these two concepts for specific classes of graphs. Another open problem is determining the computational complexity of the poset dimension problem for certain classes of posets.

In recent years, researchers have also explored the relationship between Boxicity and Poset Dimension and other graph parameters, such as tree-width, clique number, and chromatic number. Several results have been obtained showing connections between these parameters, which can be useful when analyzing large datasets.

Overall, the study of Boxicity and Poset Dimension has applications in a wide range of fields and has stimulated much research in combinatorial optimization. Although many problems related to these concepts remain open, recent advances have shed light on their connections to other graph parameters, and further research in this area has the potential to unlock new insights and improve the efficiency of data analysis at large.","(418, 17)","Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set

","This second part of a 2 volume-expertise is mainly based on the results of the inventory described in the first part. It is also based on a ""worrying"" statement in the terms of reference of this expert report 1, which states that ""Asia enjoys a favourable technological context [in terms of equipment according to UN statistics]. Nevertheless, digital technology is still hardly present in the practices of the member institutions of the Agency and the francophone university community; So distance education is not well developed: there are currently no French-language distance training courses offered by an establishment in Asia; The region has only 14 enrolled in ODL over the period 2010 - 2014; Only three institutions have responded to the AUF's ""Mooc"" calls for projects over the last two years, etc."". The terms of reference also indicate a state of deficiency ""in the Francophone digital campuses whose officials explain that the computer equipment are less and less used for individual practices"". The proliferation of mobile digital technologies that would normally constitute an important asset for the development of teaching practices and innovative research around the Francophone digital campuses has not lived up to expectations. The paper refers to another no less important detail that would explain the paradox between the proliferation of technological tools and the reduction in usage when it indicates that, in parallel, and contrary to the francophone campuses, In English a positive dynamics of integration of T ICE and distance"". The document provides concrete examples, such as the ASEAN Cyber University (ACU) program run by South Korea and its e-learning centers in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar, The Vietnamese language and the fablab set up in the region since 2014 without the Francophonie being involved. A first hypothesis emerges from this premonitory observation that it is not technology that justifies the gradual demobilization (or even demotivation) of local actors to establish forms of Francophone partnerships for training and research. Nor is it a question of political will to improve technological infrastructure in digital training and research.

Almost all the interviews carried out within the framework of this mission demonstrated the convergence of views and ambitious attitudes expressed by three categories of actors encountered:- political actors met in the ministries of education of the three countries who are aware of the importance of digital education and the added value generated by technologies for education. Each of the three countries has a regulatory framework and national technological innovation projects for education and digital education;- public and private academic institutions which, through their rectors, presidents and technical and pedagogical leaders, demonstrate their profound convictions for digital education (for reasons of quality, competitiveness and economic interest).

However, given the rather centralized governance model at state level, the majority of academic institutions in the three countries are often awaiting the promulgation of legal texts (decrees, charters, conventions, directives , Etc.) that enable them to act and adopt innovative solutions in teaching and research;- Teacher-researchers relatively little consulted in this expertise, but sufficiently engaged as actors on the ground to be able to predict their points of view with regard to the use of digital in their pedagogical and research activities. Teachers and researchers with relatively modest incomes would inevitably have a decisive role in any academic reform on the digital level if concrete mobilizing arguments could compensate for their shortfalls by joining digital training or development projects or programs.","(631, 14)","This research paper explores the potential of distance learning and digital tools for higher education and research in the Asia-Pacific region, specifically focusing on Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The second part of this paper presents a set of recommendations and a roadmap for implementing these technologies in these countries.

The first recommendation is to invest in infrastructure that supports digital learning. This includes building robust networks, providing access to digital devices, and training teachers and students on how to use these tools effectively. Governments and universities must collaborate to make these resources widely available.

The second recommendation is to create and curate high-quality digital content. Textbooks, lectures, and other learning materials should be developed or adapted for digital formats, and made available online for free or at a low cost. Collaboration between institutions can help pool resources and reduce duplication of effort.

The third recommendation is to develop interactive and collaborative learning tools. These tools can help students engage with course materials and with each other, even when they are studying remotely. This can include videoconferencing software, social media platforms, and online discussion forums.

The fourth recommendation is to ensure that the development of digital learning tools is based on research and best practices. This includes evaluating the effectiveness of different tools and approaches, and using this information to improve their design and implementation. Research should also be conducted on the impact of digital learning on student outcomes.

The final recommendation is to foster a culture of innovation and collaboration. This includes creating spaces for experimentation and learning, and providing opportunities for educators and researchers to share their experiences and insights. Governments and universities must work together to support this culture.

To achieve these recommendations, a roadmap is proposed that outlines the necessary steps and timelines. This includes identifying key stakeholders and partners, setting up pilot projects, and scaling up successful initiatives. The roadmap also highlights potential challenges and risks that must be addressed, such as the need for adequate funding and the risk of unequal access to digital resources.

","CEA/IRFM is conducting R\&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the 5 GHz ITER LHCD system, which is expected to transmit 20 MW of RF power to the plasma. Two 5 GHz 500 kW BeO pill-box type window prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company, in close collaboration with CEA/IRFM. Both windows have been validated at low power, showing good agreement between measured and modeling, with a return loss better than 32 dB and an insertion loss below 0.05 dB. This paper reports on the window RF design and the low power measurements. The high power tests up to 500kW have been carried out in March 2013 in collaboration with NFRI. Results of these tests are also reported. In the current ITER LHCD design, 20 MW Continuous Wave (CW) of Radio-Frequency power at 5 GHz are expected to be generated and transmitted to the plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat waveguide pressure, forty eight 5 GHz 500kW CW windows are to be assembled on the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, forty eight additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate and monitor the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line pressure. These windows are identified as being one of the main critical components for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies [1] [2] [3] or more recently [4] [5] , and clearly require an important R\&D effort. In this context and even if the LHCD system is not part of the construction baseline, the CEA/IRFM is conducting a R\&D effort in order to validate a design and the performances of these RF windows. In order to begin the assessment of this need, two 5 GHz 500 kW/5 s pill-box type windows prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company in close collaboration with the CEA/IRFM [6]. The section 2 of this paper reports the RF and mechanical design of a 5 GHz window. Some features of the mechanical design and the experimental RF measurements at low power are reported in section 3. High power results, made in collaboration with NFRI, are detailed in section 4. The development of CW windows is discussed in the conclusion. 2-RF AND MECHANICAL DESIGN The proposed 5 GHz RF window is based on a pill-box design [2] , i.e. a ceramic brazed in portion of a circular waveguide, connected on either side to a rectangular waveguide section. Typical design rules of thumb of such device are circular section diameter about the same size of the diagonal of the rectangular waveguide (cf. FIGURE 1). Without taking into account the ceramic, the circular section length is approximately half a guided wavelength of the circular TE 11 mode, in order for the device to act as a half-wave transformer.

Once optimized, taking into account the ceramic, matching is correct only for a narrow band of frequency and is very sensitive to the device dimensions and the ceramic relative permittivity. The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be extracted by an active water cooling, depends on the inside electric field topology and of ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent). Undesirable modes due to parasitic resonances can be excited in the ceramic volume, raising the electric field and","(624, 24)","The development of next-generation fusion reactors, such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), requires the use of high power sources to generate and sustain plasma. The Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system is one such high-energy source that is designed to provide steady-state current drive for fusion reactor operation. In order to achieve this, the LHCD system requires a high-power window capable of transmitting RF power to the plasma.

This paper describes the design and RF measurements of a 5 GHz 500 kW window for the ITER LHCD system. The goal of this research was to develop an optimized design for the window that would meet the stringent requirements of the LHCD system, while also providing reliable and efficient operation. The window design was based on a number of key factors, including the transmission properties of the materials, the need for high power handling capability, and the thermal management of the structure.

Simulations were used to optimize the design of the window, and several prototypes were fabricated to investigate the performance of the design under a variety of conditions. RF measurements were taken on the prototypes to determine their transmission properties and to verify that they met the requirements of the LHCD system. The results of these measurements revealed that the window design was able to meet all of the high-power requirements of the ITER LHCD system.

The research also investigated the thermal behavior of the window during operation, using simulations and experimental measurements. The results showed that the thermal management of the window was critical to its performance, as high-power RF transmission caused significant heating of the window. The simulations and experiments showed that effective cooling of the window was necessary to maintain reliable and efficient operation.

In conclusion, this paper presents the design and RF measurements of a 5 GHz 500 kW window for the ITER LHCD system. The research demonstrated the feasibility of the window design, and provided important insights into the challenges associated with high-power RF transmission and thermal management. The results of this research will be useful in the development of next-generation fusion reactors, as they will help to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of the LHCD system.","(397, 15)","CEA/IRFM is conducting R\&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the

system. One of these components is a 5 GHz, 500 kW window that will be used to transmit
microwaves from the gyrotron to the plasma. In this paper, we present the design and RF
measurements of this window.
The window is designed to operate at a frequency of 5 GHz and a power level of 500 kW. It
consists of a dielectric layer sandwiched between two metallic layers. The dielectric layer is
made of alumina (Al2O3), which has a high dielectric constant and a low loss tangent. The
metallic layers are made of copper, which has a high electrical conductivity and a low
resistivity. The thickness of the dielectric layer is 0.5 mm, while the thickness of the metallic
layers is 0.1 mm.
The window was fabricated using a combination of machining and chemical etching. The
dielectric layer was machined to the desired shape and size using a computer numerical
control (CNC) milling machine. The metallic layers were chemically etched using a solution
of ferric chloride (FeCl3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). The etching process was carefully
controlled to ensure that the thickness of the layers was uniform and within the specified
tolerances.
The RF measurements of the window were performed using a vector network analyzer (VNA).
The VNA was connected to the input and output ports of the window using coaxial cables. The
S-parameters of the window were measured at different frequencies and power levels. The
results showed that the window had a low insertion loss (less than 0.1 dB) and a high return
loss (greater than 20 dB) over the entire frequency range of interest. The window also had a
low phase shift (less than 5 degrees) and a high isolation (greater than 30 dB) between the
input and output ports.
Based on these results, we conclude that the window meets the requirements for the ITER
LHCD system. It has a low insertion loss, a high return loss, a low phase shift, and a high
isolation. It is also robust and reliable, as it can withstand high power levels and harsh
environmental conditions. We believe that this window will play a critical role in the success
of the ITER project.","(442, 21)","CEA/IRFM is conducting R\&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the

Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron
","Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron to centimeter size. Meteorites are evidence that individual grains of those sizes were collected and assembled into planetesimals in the young solar system. Aims. We assess the efficiency of dust collection of a swarm of non-drifting planetesimals {\rev with radii ranging from 1 to $10^3$\,km and beyond. Methods. We calculate the collision probability of dust drifting in the disk due to gas drag by planetesimal accounting for several regimes depending on the size of the planetesimal, dust, and orbital distance: the geometric, Safronov, settling, and three-body regimes. We also include a hydrodynamical regime to account for the fact that small grains tend to be carried by the gas flow around planetesimals. Results. We provide expressions for the collision probability of dust by planetesimals and for the filtering efficiency by a swarm of planetesimals. For standard turbulence conditions (i.e., a turbulence parameter $\alpha=10^{-2}$), filtering is found to be inefficient, meaning that when crossing a minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) belt of planetesimals extending between 0.1 AU and 35 AU most dust particles are eventually accreted by the central star rather than colliding with planetesimals. However, if the disk is weakly turbulent ($\alpha=10^{-4}$) filtering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all smaller than about 10 km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in the geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km in size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller than one tenth of the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case most collisions take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very different properties: we find that the local filtering efficiency $x_{filter,MMSN}$ scales with $r^{-7/4}$ (where $r$ is the orbital distance) in the geometric regime, but with $r^{-1/4}$ to $r^{1/4}$ in the settling regime.

This implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur close to the central star and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the other hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling regime is expected to be more gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust particles much smaller than millimeter size tend only to be captured by the smallest planetesimals because they otherwise move on gas streamlines and their collisions take place in the hydrodynamical regime. Conclusions. Our results hint at an inside-out formation of planetesimals in the infant solar system because small planetesimals in the geometrical limit can filter dust much more efficiently close to the central star. However, even a fully-formed belt of planetesimals such as the MMSN only marginally captures inward-drifting dust and this seems to imply that dust in the protosolar disk has been filtered by planetesimals even smaller than 1 km (not included in this study) or that it has been assembled into planetesimals by other mechanisms (e.g., orderly growth, capture into vortexes). Further refinement of our work concerns, among other things: a quantitative description of the transition region between the hydro and settling regimes; an assessment of the role of disk turbulence for collisions, in particular in the hydro regime; and the coupling of our model to a planetesimal formation model.","(646, 20)","This research paper explores the mechanisms of dust filtering and processing in planetesimals, specifically focusing on non-drifting planetesimals. The collision probabilities for such planetesimals were derived and analyzed to illuminate their impacts on the filtration and processing of dust. These collision probabilities were analyzed through numerical simulations, which incorporated varied parameters such as planetesimal radius and density as well as dust particle size and distribution.


The results of the analysis show that non-drifting planetesimals play a significant role in the early stages of planet formation through their ability to filter and process dust. Through collisions with dust particles, these planetesimals are able to both grow in size and remove debris from the surrounding environment. The effects of this filtering and processing are not only important for the planetesimal itself, but also relevant for later stages of planet formation when large bodies form through collisions of planetesimals.


The analytical framework and numerical simulations used in the research provide a foundation for future studies into the processes of dust filtering and processing by planetesimals. The collision probabilities derived for non-drifting planetesimals can be applied to other studies of planetesimal growth and dust filtration, improving our understanding of early stages of planetary formation.


An important implication of this research is that the mechanisms of dust filtration and processing by non-drifting planetesimals enable the successful formation of larger bodies like planets and asteroids, crucial to the evolution of our solar system and others. By examining these mechanisms, insights can be gained not only into the formation of planets, but also into the evolution of other celestial bodies throughout the universe.


In conclusion, this research paper provides a thorough analysis of the collision probabilities for non-drifting planetesimals and their impact on the processing and filtering of dust. The results show that non-drifting planetesimals play an important role in the early stages of planet formation through their ability to remove debris and grow in size. This research can improve our understanding of the formation of planets not only in our solar system, but throughout the universe as well. The analytical framework and numerical simulations used in this study provide a strong foundation for further research in this field.","(386, 14)","Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron
sized grains to pebbles up to several centimeters in size. These dust grains are thought to be
the building blocks of planetesimals and planets. However, the process by which dust grains
grow into planetesimals is not well understood. In this paper, we present a new model for the
growth of dust grains into planetesimals, which takes into account the effects of collisions
between dust grains and planetesimals. We show that collisions between dust grains and
planetesimals can lead to the formation of planetesimals, and we derive an expression for the
probability of a collision between a dust grain and a planetesimal.
Methodology. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to model the growth of dust grains into
planetesimals. We assume that the dust grains are distributed uniformly throughout the disk,
and that the planetesimals are randomly distributed throughout the disk. We also assume that
the planetesimals are spherical and have a uniform density. We use a random number generator
to determine the position and velocity of each dust grain and planetesimal, and we use a
collision detection algorithm to determine whether or not a collision occurs between a dust
grain and a planetesimal. If a collision occurs, we use a collision response algorithm to
determine the outcome of the collision.
Findings. We find that the probability of a dust grain colliding with a planetesimal is
proportional to the square of the relative velocity between the dust grain and the planetesimal,
and inversely proportional to the radius of the planetesimal. We also find that the probability
of a dust grain growing into a planetesimal is proportional to the cube of the radius of the
Implications. Our results have important implications for the formation of planets in
circumstellar disks. We show that dust grains can grow into planetesimals through collisions
with planetesimals. This suggests that planetesimals may play an important role in the
formation of planets in circumstellar disks. Our results also suggest that the growth of dust
grains into planetesimals may be a more efficient process than previously thought.","(379, 19)","Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron

Methodology. We used N-body simulations of planetesimal collisions to calculate the
collision probabilities between planetesimal and planetesimal dust grains.

Findings. We found that the collision probability between a planetesimal grain and
another planetesimal depends on the size of the planetesimal.

Stylolites are ubiquitous geo-patterns observed in rocks in the upper crust, from geological reservoirs in
","Stylolites are ubiquitous geo-patterns observed in rocks in the upper crust, from geological reservoirs in sedimentary rocks to deformation zones, in folds, faults, and shear zones. These rough surfaces play a major role in the dissolution of rocks around stressed contacts, the transport of dissolved material and the precipitation in surrounding pores. Consequently, they play an active role in the evolution of rock microstructures and rheological properties in the Earth's crust. They are observed individually or in networks, in proximity to fractures and joints, and in numerous geological settings. This review article deals with their geometrical and compositional characteristics and the factors leading to their genesis. The main questions this review focuses on are the following: How do they form? How can they be used to measure strain and formation stress? How do they control fluid flow in the upper crust?

Geometrically, stylolites have fractal roughness, with fractal geometrical properties exhibiting typically three scaling regimes: a self-affine scaling with Hurst exponent 1.1+/-0.1 at small scale (up to tens or hundreds of microns), another one with Hurst exponent around 0.5 to 0.6 at intermediate scale (up to millimeters or centimeters), and in the case of sedimentary stylolites, a flat scaling at large scale. More complicated anisotropic scaling (scaling laws depending of the direction of the profile considered) is found in the case of tectonic stylolites. We report models based on first principles from physical chemistry and statistical physics, including a mechanical component for the free-energy associated with stress concentrations, and a precise tracking of the influence of grain-scale heterogeneities and disorder on the resulting (micro)structures. Experimental efforts to reproduce stylolites in the laboratory are also reviewed. We show that although micrometer-size stylolite teeth are obtained in laboratory experiments, teeth deforming numerous grains have not yet been obtained experimentally, which is understandable given the very long formation time of such geometries. Finally, the applications of stylolites as strain and stress markers, to determine paleostress magnitude are reviewed. We show that the scalings in stylolite heights and the crossover scale between these scalings can be used to determine the stress magnitude (its scalar value) perpendicular to the stylolite surface during the stylolite formation, and that the stress anisotropy in the stylolite plane can be determined for the case of tectonic stylolites. We also show that the crossover between medium (millimetric) scales and large (pluricentimetric) scales, in the case of sedimentary stylolites, provides a good marker for the total amount of dissolution, which is still valid even when the largest teeth start to dissolve -- which leads to the loss of information, since the total deformation is not anymore recorded in a single marker structure. We discuss the impact of the stylolites on the evolution of the transport properties of the hosting rock, and show that they promote a permeability increase parallel to the stylolites, whereas their effect on the permeability transverse to the stylolite can be negligible, or may reduce the permeability, depending on the development of the stylolite.

Highlights: Stylolite formation depends on rock composition and structure, stress and fluids. Stylolite geometry, fractal and self-affine properties, network structure, are investigated. The experiments and physics-based numerical models for their formation are reviewed. Stylolites can be used as markers of strain, paleostress orientation and magnitude. Stylolites impact transport properties, as function of maturity and flow direction.","(627, 22)","Stylolites are a critical feature in sedimentary rocks, which have garnered significant interest over the years given their widespread occurrence and potential significance in several geological processes. In this review, we provide an extensive analysis of the literature available on stylolites, thereby enabling a better understanding of their behavior and formation mechanisms. First, we discuss the various historical perspectives on stylolites and the evolution of ideas explaining their formation. Subsequently, we delve into the current understanding of the physical and chemical processes that induce and animate stylolites. We highlight field and laboratory studies, alongside analytical techniques such as petrography, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe, and Raman spectroscopy, which have contributed significantly to the current state of knowledge on stylolites.

We further analyze the composition and mineralogy of stylolites with a discussion on their role in hydrocarbon exploration. We evaluate the interplay between mechanical and chemical compaction mechanisms in their formation and briefly examine some of the significant implications in reservoir quality assessments. We discuss how their presence can affect porosity, permeability, and ultimately oil recovery in underground reservoirs and provide a comprehensive review of the available literature on stylolites as a tool in hydrocarbon exploration. 

Furthermore, we expound on the association of stylolites with various geological phenomena, including deformation stress, fluid activity, and diagenesis.

Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to give
","Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to give H(2)O(2). Recently, the mutation of the Glu47 residue into alanine (E47A) in the active site of SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii has allowed the stabilization of an iron-peroxo species when quickly reacted with H(2)O(2) [Math{\'e} et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 4966-4967]. To further investigate this non-heme peroxo-iron species, we have carried out a M{\""o}ssbauer study of the (57)Fe-enriched E47A SOR from D. baarsii reacted quickly with H(2)O(2). Considering the M{\""o}ssbauer data, we conclude, in conjunction with the other spectroscopic data available and with the results of density functional calculations on related models, that this species corresponds to a high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) complex. This is one of the first examples of such a species in a biological system for which M{\""o}ssbauer parameters are now available: delta(/Fe) = 0.54 (1) mm/s, DeltaE(Q) = -0.80 (5) mm/s, and the asymmetry parameter eta = 0.60 (5) mm/s. The M{\""o}ssbauer and spin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on peroxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center in SOR from Pyrococcus furiosus, for which structural data are available in the literature [Yeh et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2499-2508]. For comparison, similar calculations have been carried out on a model derived from 2 (model 3), where the [CH(3)-S](1)(-) group has been replaced by the neutral [NH(3)](0) group [Neese and Solomon (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12829-12848]. Both models 2 and 3 contain a formally high-spin Fe(3+) ion (i.e., with empty minority spin orbitals). We found, however, a significant fraction (approximately 0.6 for 2, approximately 0.8 for 3) of spin (equivalently charge) spread over two occupied (minority spin) orbitals. The quadrupole splitting value for 2 is found to be negative and matches quite well the experimental value. The computed quadrupole tensors are rhombic in the case of 2 and axial in the case of 3. This difference originates directly from the presence of the thiolate ligand in 2. A correlation between experimental isomer shifts for Fe(3+) mononuclear complexes with computed electron densities at the iron nucleus has been built and used to evaluate the isomer shift values for 2 and 3 (0.56 and 0.63 mm/s, respectively). A significant increase of isomer shift value is found upon going from a methylthiolate to a nitrogen ligand for the Fe(3+) ion, consistent with covalency effects due to the presence of the axial thiolate ligand. Considering that the isomer shift value for 3 is likely to be in the 0.61-0.65 mm/s range [Horner et al. (2002) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 3278-3283], the isomer shift value for a high-spin eta(2)-O(2) Fe(3+) complex with an axial thiolate group can be estimated to be in the 0.54-0.58 mm/s range. The occurrence of a side-on peroxo intermediate in SOR is discussed in relation to the recent data published for a side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) species in another biological system [Karlsson et al.

Our M{\""o}ssbauer spectroscopy measurements reveal the presence of a high-spin Fe3+ center in the peroxo species, which exhibits an unusual side-on binding mode.

Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive
","Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive reasoning. This is so because there are general and definite rules for the change of subjective probabilities through information or experience; induction and belief change are one and same topic, after all. The most basic of these rules is simply to conditionalize with respect to the information received; and there are similar and more general rules. 1 Hence, a fundamental reason for the epistemological success of probability theory is that there at all exists a well-behaved concept of conditional probability. Still, people have, and have reasons for, various concerns over probability theory. One of these is my starting point: Intuitively, we have the notion of plain belief; we believe propositions2 to be true (or to be false or neither). Probability theory, however, offers no formal counterpart to this notion. Believing A is not the same as having probability 1 for A, because probability 1 is incorrigible3; but plain belief is clearly corrigible. And believing A is not the same as giving A a probability larger than some 1 - c, because believing A and believing B is usually taken to be equivalent to believing A & B.4 Thus, it seems that the formal representation of plain belief has to take a non-probabilistic route. Indeed, representing plain belief seems easy enough: simply represent an epistemic state by the set of all propositions believed true in it or, since I make the common assumption that plain belief is deductively closed, by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it. But this does not yet provide a theory of induction, i.e.

an answer to the question how epistemic states so represented are changed tbrough information or experience. There is a convincing partial answer: if the new information is compatible with the old epistemic state, then the new epistemic state is simply represented by the conjunction of the new information and the old beliefs. This answer is partial because it does not cover the quite common case where the new information is incompatible with the old beliefs. It is, however, important to complete the answer and to cover this case, too; otherwise, we would not represent plain belief as conigible. The crucial problem is that there is no good completion. When epistemic states are represented simply by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it, the answer cannot be completed; and though there is a lot of fruitful work, no other representation of epistemic states has been proposed, as far as I know, which provides a complete solution to this problem. In this paper, I want to suggest such a solution. In [4], I have more fully argued that this is the only solution, if certain plausible desiderata are to be satisfied. Here, in section 2, I will be content with formally defining and intuitively explaining my proposal. I will compare my proposal with probability theory in section 3. It will turn out that the theory I am proposing is structurally homomorphic to probability theory in important respects and that it is thus equally easily implementable, but moreover computationally simpler. Section 4 contains a very brief comparison with various kinds of logics, in particular conditional logic, with Shackle's functions of potential surprise and related theories, and with the Dempster - Shafer theory of belief functions.","(632, 23)","Inductive reasoning plays a vital role in scientific inquiry by enabling the inference of conclusions from empirical data. Despite its significance, there exist fundamental challenges in explicating the foundations of inductive reasoning. In particular, traditional approaches have used probabilistic frameworks as the primary tool for modeling inductive reasoning. However, this approach has limited application in real-life scenarios, and even fails to provide an adequate explanation for phenomena that involve non-probabilistic or correlated uncertainties. In this paper, we introduce a general non-probabilistic theory of inductive reasoning, which offers a fresh perspective on traditional models of reasoning. Our theory considers inductive reasoning as a process of developing theories about the causal structure of a given phenomenon, and seeks to provide a systematic framework for this process. Our approach considers the problem of inductive reasoning as part of a larger context of decision-making under uncertainty, and utilizes tools from causal inference, game theory, and information theory.

Through the lens of our theory, we can better understand and formalize the process of inductive reasoning. Specifically, we articulate a new framework that identifies the causal structure of a given phenomenon as the key element for making sound inductive inferences, and further explore how this structure can be uncovered. Our framework is founded on the idea that inductive reasoning can be viewed as a game between the reasoner and nature, and that the optimal strategy in this game requires an analysis of the causal structure. We then introduce a new class of models that capture non-probabilistic uncertainties and are well-defined within this framework. These models are shown to be as versatile as probabilistic models in describing inductive reasoning, and in fact, can better capture the nuances of non-probabilistic uncertainties.

Overall, the proposed non-probabilistic theory of inductive reasoning offers a new approach to model and solve complicated inductive inference problems. It leverages advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence to bring us one step closer to achieving a more general understanding of inductive reasoning. We conclude by highlighting some future directions for research, including the challenges in developing new methodologies and applications for the principle of inductive inference.

Given a universe of discourse X-a domain of possible outcomes-an experiment may consist of selecting
","Given a universe of discourse X-a domain of possible outcomes-an experiment may consist of selecting one of its elements, subject to the operation of chance, or of observing the elements, subject to imprecision. A priori uncertainty about the actual result of the experiment may be quantified, representing either the likelihood of the choice of :r_X or the degree to which any such X would be suitable as a description of the outcome. The former case corresponds to a probability distribution, while the latter gives a possibility assignment on X. The study of such assignments and their properties falls within the purview of possibility theory [DP88, Y80, Z783. It, like probability theory, assigns values between 0 and 1 to express likelihoods of outcomes.

Here, however, the similarity ends. Possibility theory uses the maximum and minimum functions to combine uncertainties, whereas probability theory uses the plus and times operations. This leads to very dissimilar theories in terms of analytical framework, even though they share several semantic concepts. One of the shared concepts consists of expressing quantitatively the uncertainty associated with a given distribution. In probability theory its value corresponds to the gain of information that would result from conducting an experiment and ascertaining an actual result. This gain of information can equally well be viewed as a decrease in uncertainty about the outcome of an experiment. In this case the standard measure of information, and thus uncertainty, is Shannon entropy [AD75, G77]. It enjoys several advantages-it is characterized uniquely by a few, very natural properties, and it can be conveniently used in decision processes. This application is based on the principle of maximum entropy; it has become a popular method of relating decisions to uncertainty. This paper demonstrates that an equally integrated theory can be built on the foundation of possibility theory. We first show how to define measures of in formation and uncertainty for possibility assignments.

Next we construct an information-based metric on the space of all possibility distributions defined on a given domain. It allows us to capture the notion of proximity in information content among the distributions. Lastly, we show that all the above constructions can be carried out for continuous distributions-possibility assignments on arbitrary measurable domains. We consider this step very significant-finite domains of discourse are but approximations of the real-life infinite domains. If possibility theory is to represent real world situations, it must handle continuous distributions both directly and through finite approximations. In the last section we discuss a principle of maximum uncertainty for possibility distributions. We show how such a principle could be formalized as an inference rule. We also suggest it could be derived as a consequence of simple assumptions about combining information. We would like to mention that possibility assignments can be viewed as fuzzy sets and that every fuzzy set gives rise to an assignment of possibilities. This correspondence has far reaching consequences in logic and in control theory. Our treatment here is independent of any special interpretation; in particular we speak of possibility distributions and possibility measures, defining them as measurable mappings into the interval [0, 1]. Our presentation is intended as a self-contained, albeit terse summary.

Topics discussed were selected with care, to demonstrate both the completeness and a certain elegance of the theory. Proofs are not included; we only offer illustrative examples.","(615, 30)","This research paper presents a formal model of uncertainty for possibilistic rules. Possibilistic rules are commonly used in the fields of artificial intelligence, fuzzy logic, and decision-making. The proposed model aims to provide a means of quantifying the uncertainty inherent in these rules.

To achieve this goal, the model introduces the notion of a possibility distribution function. This function assigns a possibility value to each possible state of the world, representing the degree to which that state is possible given the available evidence and the uncertainty inherent in the possibilistic rules. The model also defines a set of rules for combining possibility values, allowing for the aggregation of uncertain information from multiple sources.

The proposed model provides several key benefits over existing approaches to uncertainty in possibilistic rules. First, it provides a more principled and rigorous mathematical framework for dealing with uncertainty in these rules. Second, it allows for a more flexible representation of uncertainty, enabling the modeling of more complex and nuanced forms of uncertainty. Finally, it enables the use of a wider range of probabilistic inference techniques, allowing for more accurate and efficient decision-making.

To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model, we provide several empirical evaluations. These evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in capturing and reasoning with uncertainty in various scenarios. Specifically, we show that the model can accurately capture uncertainty in complex decision-making tasks, such as medical diagnosis and financial forecasting. We also show that the model is computationally efficient, making it feasible for use in real-world applications.

The initial condition is chosen such that $\{X_i(0)\}_{i\in \mathbb{Z}^d}$ is a shift-invariant and shift-ergodic random field on $[0,\infty)$ with mean $\Theta\in (0,\infty)$ (the evolution preserves the mean). We show that the long-time behavior of this system is the result of a delicate interplay between $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ and $b$, in contrast to systems where the diffusion function is subquadratic. In particular, let $\hat{a}(i,j)={1/2}[a(i,j)+a(j,i)]$, $i,j\in \mathbb{Z}^d$, denote the symmetrized transition kernel. We show that: (A) If $\hat{a}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is recurrent, then for any $b>0$ the system locally dies out. (B) If $\hat{a}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is transient, then there exist $b_*\geq b_2>0$ such that: (B1)d The system converges to an equilibrium $\nu_{\Theta}$ (with mean $\Theta$) if $0<b<b_*$. (B2) The system locally dies out if $b>b_*$. (B3) $\nu_{\Theta}$ has a finite 2nd moment if and only if $0<b<b_2$. (B4) The 2nd moment diverges exponentially fast if and only if $b>b_2$. The equilibrium $\nu_{\Theta}$ is shown to be associated and mixing for all $0<b<b_*$. We argue in favor of the conjecture that $b_*>b_2$. We further conjecture that the system locally dies out at $b=b_*$. For the case where $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is symmetric and transient we further show that: (C) There exists a sequence $b_2\geq b_3\geq b_4\geq ... >0$ such that: (C1) $\nu_{\Theta}$ has a finite $m$th moment if and only if $0<b<b_m$.

The critical value $b_*$ arises from a stochastic representation of the Palm distribution of the system.

Alongside phase transitions in the Ising model, the authors demonstrate the existence of phase transitions for interacting diffusions in a bounded domain. Specifically, the authors study the asymptotic behavior of the occupation time near the boundary of the domain and the formation of persistent macroscopic clusters. For this purpose, they use representation formulas for occupation times and establish the asymptotics of the same. The authors derive phase diagrams based on the occupation time, and these phase diagrams are quite different from the traditional ones for the Ising model. Furthermore, the authors show that the phase transition for interacting diffusions is much richer than that for the Ising model, as it exhibits a discontinuity phenomenon. They discuss the origin of this discontinuity phenomenon and describe how it arises from a subtle interplay between the sub-diffusive nature of the diffusion process and the interaction among particles.

The authors conduct simulations to verify their analytical results and study the long-time behavior of interacting Brownian particles in a bounded domain.

On the other hand, if $V$ does not satisfy this condition, then the system will converge to the same stationary distribution as in the quadratic case.

The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important
","The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Due to the plasma screening effect, the color attraction between the heavy quark antiquark pair inside a quarkonium is significantly suppressed at high temperature and thus no bound states can exist, i.e., they ""melt"". In addition, a bound heavy quark antiquark pair can dissociate if enough energy is transferred to it in a dynamical process inside the plasma. So one would expect the production of quarkonium to be considerably suppressed in heavy ion collisions. However, experimental measurements have shown that a large amount of quarkonia survive the evolution inside the high temperature plasma. It is realized that the in-medium recombination of unbound heavy quark pairs into quarkonium is as crucial as the melting and dissociation. Thus, phenomenological studies have to account for static screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. But recombination is less understood theoretically than the melting and dissociation. Many studies using semi-classical transport equations model the recombination effect from the consideration of detailed balance at thermal equilibrium. However, these studies cannot explain how the system of quarkonium reaches equilibrium and estimate the time scale of the thermalization.

Recently, another approach based on the open quantum system formalism started being used. In this framework, one solves a quantum evolution for in-medium quarkonium. Dissociation and recombination are accounted for consistently.

However, the connection between the semi-classical transport equation and the quantum evolution is not clear. In this dissertation, I will try to address the issues raised above. As a warm-up project, I will first study a similar problem: $\alpha$-$\alpha$ scattering at the $^8$Be resonance inside an $e^-e^+\gamma$ plasma. By applying pionless effective field theory and thermal field theory, I will show how the plasma screening effect modifies the $^8$Be resonance energy and width. I will discuss the need to use the open quantum system formalism when studying the time evolution of a system embedded inside a plasma. Then I will use effective field theory of QCD and the open quantum system formalism to derive a Lindblad equation for bound and unbound heavy quark antiquark pairs inside a weakly-coupled QGP. Under the Markovian approximation and the assumption of weak coupling between the system and the environment, the Lindblad equation will be shown to turn to a Boltzmann transport equation if a Wigner transform is applied to the open system density matrix. These assumptions will be justified by using the separation of scales, which is assumed in the construction of effective field theory. I will show the scattering amplitudes that contribute to the collision terms in the Boltzmann equation are gauge invariant and infrared safe. By coupling the transport equation of quarkonium with those of open heavy flavors and solving them using Monte Carlo simulations, I will demonstrate how the system of bound and unbound heavy quark antiquark pairs reaches detailed balance and equilibrium inside the QGP. Phenomenologically, my calculations can describe the experimental data on bottomonium production. Finally I will extend the framework to study the in-medium evolution of heavy diquarks and estimate the production rate of the doubly charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ in heavy ion collisions.","(600, 25)","Effective Field Theory (EFT) has become an increasingly important tool in the field of nuclear physics, providing a systematic framework for conducting calculations in a range of energy regimes. By treating the nuclear force as a perturbation of an underlying theory, such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), EFT allows for the accurate prediction of observables across a broad range of energies and systems.

In this paper, we review the application of EFT in nuclear physics, discussing its fundamental principles and its use in nuclear structure, nuclear reactions and nuclear astrophysics. We first summarize the basic concepts of EFT, including power counting, renormalization and the operator product expansion, and their applicability to nuclear forces.

We then present several examples of EFT calculations in nuclear structure, including the prediction of ground-state properties, such as binding energies and radii, and excited-state spectra, such as giant resonances and alpha clustering. We demonstrate the advantages of EFT over other approaches, such as shell model and mean-field theory, in providing accurate and systematic descriptions of nuclear phenomena.

Next, we discuss EFT in the context of nuclear reactions, with a focus on low-energy reactions, such as radiative capture and scattering, and their relevance for nuclear astrophysics. We review the formalism of EFT for few-nucleon scattering and its extension to more complex systems, such as those encountered in nuclear astrophysics, and describe its successes in explaining experimental data and predicting astrophysical reaction rates.

Finally, we discuss the future prospects of EFT in nuclear physics, considering its potential impact on our understanding of neutron-rich and exotic nuclei, the physics of the neutron star crust and the equation of state of nuclear matter. We conclude that EFT has emerged as a powerful and versatile tool in nuclear physics, capable of providing accurate and systematic predictions across a range of nuclear phenomena and regimes. Its future impact on nuclear physics is likely to be significant, enabling predictions of unprecedented accuracy for a range of important experiments and observations.","(367, 11)","The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important
tool to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in these collisions. In
particular, the suppression of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions relative to
proton-proton collisions has been interpreted as evidence for the formation of a deconfined
state of quarks and gluons. However, the interpretation of quarkonium suppression in heavy
ion collisions is complicated by the presence of cold nuclear matter effects, which can also
lead to a reduction in quarkonium production. In order to disentangle the effects of the QGP
from those of cold nuclear matter, it is necessary to develop a theoretical framework that
can accurately describe the production of quarkonium in both proton-proton and heavy ion
collisions. One such framework is effective field theory (EFT), which provides a systematic
expansion of the QCD Lagrangian in terms of small parameters, such as the heavy quark mass
and the strong coupling constant. In this paper, we apply EFT to the study of quarkonium
production in heavy ion collisions, focusing on the case of charmonium (J/ψ) and bottomonium

suppression of J/ψ and Υ production in Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
as well as the enhancement of J/ψ production in p-Pb collisions. We also discuss the

Context. The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three pillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions
","Context. The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three pillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions ("" cold chemistry ""), endothermic neutral-neutral reactions with significant activation barriers ("" warm chemistry ""), and reactions on the surfaces of dust grains. While warm chemistry becomes important in the shocks associated with turbulent dissipation regions, the main path for the formation of interstellar OH and H2O is that of cold chemistry. Aims. The aim of this study is to observationally confirm the association of atomic oxygen with both atomic and molecular gas phases, and to understand the measured abundances of OH and OH + as a function of the available reservoir of H2. Methods. We obtained absorption spectra of the ground states of OH, OH+ and OI with high-velocity resolution, with GREAT on-board SOFIA, and with the THz receiver at the APEX. We analyzed them along with ancillary spectra of HF and CH from HIFI. To deconvolve them from the hyperfine structure and to separate the blend that is due to various velocity components on the sightline, we fit model spectra consisting of an appropriate number of Gaussian profiles using a method combining simulated annealing with downhill simplex minimization. Together with HF and/or CH as a surrogate for H2, and HI $\lambda$21 cm data, the molecular hydrogen fraction f^N\_H2 = N(H 2)/(N(H) + 2N(H 2)) can be determined. We then investigated abundance ratios as a function of f^N\_H2. Results. The column density of OI is correlated at a high significance with the amount of available molecular and atomic hydrogen, with an atomic oxygen abundance of $3 \times 10 ^{-4}$ relative to H nuclei.

While the velocities of the absorption features of OH and OH+ are loosely correlated and reflect the spiral arm crossings on the sightline, upon closer inspection they display an anticorrespondence. The arm-to-interarm density contrast is found to be higher in OH than in OH+. While both species can coexist, with a higher abundance in OH than in OH+, the latter is found less frequently in absence of OH than the other way around, which is a direct consequence of the rapid destruction of OH+ by dissociative recombination when not enough H2 is available. This conjecture has been substantiated by a comparison between the OH/OH+ ratio with f^N\_H2, showing a clear correlation.

The hydrogen abstraction reaction chain OH+ (H2,H) H2O+ (H2,H)H3O+ is confirmed as the pathway for the production of OH and H 2 O. Our estimate of the branching ratio of the dissociative recombination of H3O+ to OH and H2O is confined within the interval of 84 to 91%, which matches laboratory measurements (74 to 83%). -- A correlation between the linewidths and column densities of OH+ features is found to be significant with a false-alarm probability below 5%. Such a correlation is predicted by models of interstellar MHD turbulence. For OH the same correlation is found to be insignificant because there are more narrow absorption features. Conclusions. While it is difficult to assess the contributions of warm neutral-neutral chemistry to the observed abundances, it seems fair to conclude that the predictions of cold ion-neutral chemistry match the abundance patterns we observed.","(603, 24)","This study presents an analysis of far-infrared observational data to detect tracers of oxygen chemistry in diffuse clouds. Diffuse clouds have low density and are primarily composed of atomic hydrogen, with small amounts of He, C, N, O, etc. Despite their low density, these clouds contain a significant fraction of the interstellar gas in our galaxy. The chemical evolution of diffuse clouds is fundamentally different from that of dense clouds, and the key chemical processes that control their physical characteristics are not yet fully understood. The far-infrared spectral range is key to unveil the composition and chemical properties of these clouds.

We analyzed far-infrared spectral data acquired using the Herschel Space Observatory to measure major cooling lines from the oxygen chemistry in diffuse clouds. The excitation of these lines frequently emerges from chemical processes that originate from photoabsorption or photoionization by far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons. The set of observed cooling lines and their relative intensities can, in principle, provide constraints on the physical conditions, composition, and life cycle of diffuse clouds.

Our analysis focused on a sample of known diffuse clouds whose spectroscopic features show clear evidence for the presence of atomic and molecular tracers of the gas-phase oxygen chemistry. Oxygen molecules such as O$_2$, O$_3$, and CO are the strongest tracers due to their high abundance and relative stability at low density. Our goal was to use the cooling lines from these tracers to constrain the physical and chemical properties of the diffuse clouds and to investigate variations in the gas-phase oxygen chemistry in different environments of the Milky Way.

Our analysis yielded several key results. First, we detected parent and daughter cooling lines from O$_3$ and O$_2$ with the highest signal-to-noise ratio among the observed features. This suggests that O$_3$ and O$_2$ are the most efficient cooling mechanisms in FUV-illuminated diffuse clouds. Second, we found empirical correlations between the relative cooling line intensities and the FUV radiation field strength in our sample. These correlations provide important constraints on the chemical and physical evolution of the diffuse clouds. Finally, we detected the CO fundamental transitions at 4.7 and 2.6 THz in several sources, consistent with previous detections of CO in diffuse clouds.

Our results demonstrate the power and importance of far-infrared studies for understanding the composition and chemical properties of diffuse clouds. Our analysis of the various tracers of oxygen chemistry in these clouds can provide constraints on the formation, physical properties, and evolution of diffuse clouds in different regions of the galaxy. Furthermore, our empirical correlations suggest that FUV radiation fields play an essential role in regulating the physical conditions and chemical properties of diffuse clouds. Our findings can inform future studies of the chemical and physical evolution of molecular gas in the Universe.","(516, 21)","Context.

value of 0.7 predicted by the standard model of diffuse cloud chemistry. We attribute this discrepancy to the presence of
a significant amount of atomic oxygen in the diffuse clouds, which is not accounted for in the standard model. Our

average value of ~0.30. This ratio is much lower than the value of ˜0.70 predicted by the standard models of diffuse cloud

is not included in the standard models. Our results suggest that the standard models need to be revised to include the

In [12], Nilsson proposed the probabilistic logic in which the truth values of logical propositions
","In [12], Nilsson proposed the probabilistic logic in which the truth values of logical propositions are probability values between 0 and 1. It is applicable to any logical system for which the consistency of a finite set of propositions can be established. The probabilistic inference scheme reduces to the ordinary logical inference when the probabilities of all propositions are either 0 or 1. This logic has the same limitations of other probabilistic reasoning systems of the Bayesian approach. For common sense reasoning, consistency is not a very natural assumption. We have some well known examples: {Dick is a Quaker, Quakers are pacifists, Republicans are not pacifists, Dick is a Republican}and {Tweety is a bird, birds can fly, Tweety is a penguin}. In this paper, we shall propose some extensions of the probabilistic logic. In the second section, we shall consider the space of all interpretations, consistent or not. In terms of frames of discernment, the basic probability assignment (bpa) and belief function can be defined. Dempster's combination rule is applicable. This extension of probabilistic logic is called the evidential logic in [ 1]. For each proposition s, its belief function is represented by an interval [Spt(s), Pls(s)]. When all such intervals collapse to single points, the evidential logic reduces to probabilistic logic (in the generalized version of not necessarily consistent interpretations). Certainly, we get Nilsson's probabilistic logic by further restricting to consistent interpretations. In the third section, we shall give a probabilistic interpretation of probabilistic logic in terms of multi-dimensional random variables. This interpretation brings the probabilistic logic into the framework of probability theory. Let us consider a finite set S = {sl, s2, ..., Sn) of logical propositions. Each proposition may have true or false values; and may be considered as a random variable. We have a probability distribution for each proposition. The e-dimensional random variable (sl,..., Sn) may take values in the space of all interpretations of 2n binary vectors. We may compute absolute (marginal), conditional and joint probability distributions. It turns out that the permissible probabilistic interpretation vector of Nilsson [12] consists of the joint probabilities of S. Inconsistent interpretations will not appear, by setting their joint probabilities to be zeros. By summing appropriate joint probabilities, we get probabilities of individual propositions or subsets of propositions. Since the Bayes formula and other techniques are valid for e-dimensional random variables, the probabilistic logic is actually very close to the Bayesian inference schemes. In the last section, we shall consider a relaxation scheme for probabilistic logic. In this system, not only new evidences will update the belief measures of a collection of propositions, but also constraint satisfaction among these propositions in the relational network will revise these measures. This mechanism is similar to human reasoning which is an evaluative process converging to the most satisfactory result. The main idea arises from the consistent labeling problem in computer vision. This method is originally applied to scene analysis of line drawings. Later, it is applied to matching, constraint satisfaction and multi sensor fusion by several authors [8], [16] (and see references cited there). Recently, this method is used in knowledge aggregation by Landy and Hummel [9].","(629, 31)","Probabilistic logic has proven to be a powerful tool for dealing with uncertainty and reasoning under incomplete or inconsistent information. This paper explores some extensions of probabilistic logic that have been proposed in the literature, with a focus on probabilistic defeasible reasoning, Bayesian knowledge bases, and probabilistic programming.

Probabilistic defeasible reasoning extends classical defeasible reasoning to handle uncertain knowledge, allowing the derivation of conclusions that are not necessarily warranted by the premises but are still plausible given the available evidence. We review several approaches to probabilistic defeasible reasoning, including probabilistic argumentation, maximum entropy-based inference, and Bayesian networks with uncertain evidence.

Bayesian knowledge bases combine probabilistic logic with ontology representation to model uncertain and incomplete knowledge about a domain. We discuss the main features of Bayesian knowledge bases, including hierarchical structure, probabilistic axioms, and inference algorithms. We also examine some applications of Bayesian knowledge bases in natural language understanding, diagnosis, and prediction.

Probabilistic programming is a recent paradigm for defining probabilistic models and conducting probabilistic inference via computer programs. We introduce the basic concepts of probabilistic programming, including random variables, conditioning, and inference. We outline some of the key challenges in developing efficient and expressive probabilistic programming languages, such as handling the combination of discrete and continuous probability distributions, dealing with large-scale probabilistic models, and designing effective inference algorithms.

We then discuss some open research questions and opportunities in the area of probabilistic logic extensions. One promising direction is to study the integration of probabilistic logic with other probabilistic models, such as decision networks, relational models, and time series models. Another direction is to investigate the foundations of probabilistic logic and its connections with other areas of logic and mathematics, such as paraconsistent logic, nonstandard analysis, and category theory.

Finally, we conclude by highlighting the potential impact and practical applications of probabilistic logic extensions in various fields, such as artificial intelligence, cognitive science, biology, economics, and social sciences. We argue that the development of advanced probabilistic reasoning techniques and tools is crucial for addressing complex real-world problems that involve uncertainty, ambiguity, and incomplete data.","(390, 15)","In [12], Nilsson proposed the probabilistic logic in which the truth values of logical propositions

First, we introduce the concept of conditional probability in probabilistic logic. Second, we
discuss the relationship between probabilistic logic and classical logic. Third, we show how
probabilistic logic can be used to reason about uncertain knowledge. Finally, we discuss some
applications of probabilistic logic in artificial intelligence.
Conditional Probability in Probabilistic Logic
In probabilistic logic, the truth value of a logical proposition is a real number between 0 and
1. The truth value of a proposition represents the probability that the proposition is true. For
example, if the truth value of the proposition ""It will rain tomorrow"" is 0.6, then there is a 60%
chance that it will rain tomorrow.
The concept of conditional probability is central to probabilistic logic. Conditional probability
is the probability of one event given that another event has occurred. In probabilistic logic,
the conditional probability of a proposition A given a proposition B is denoted by P(A|B) and
is defined as follows:
P(A|B) = P(AB)/P(B)
where P(AB) is the joint probability of A and B, and P(B) is the probability of B.
Relationship between Probabilistic Logic and Classical Logic
Probabilistic logic is a generalization of classical logic. In classical logic, the truth values of
logical propositions are either 0 (false) or 1 (true). In probabilistic logic, however, the truth
values of logical propositions can take any value between 0and 1. This means that probabilistic
logic is more expressive than classical logic.
One way to think of probabilistic logic is as a continuous version of classical logic. Just as
classical logic can be thought of as a discrete version of fuzzy logic, probabilistic logic can be
thought of as a continuous extension of classical logic.
Reasoning about Uncertain Knowledge
One of the main advantages of probabilistic logic over classical logic is that it allows us to
reason about uncertain knowledge. In many real-world situations, we cannot be certain about
the truth of a proposition. For example, when we make a prediction about the future, we cannot
be certain that our prediction will come true. However, we can assign a probability to our
prediction, which represents our degree of confidence in the prediction.
Probabilistic logic provides a formal framework for reasoning about uncertain knowledge","(472, 23)","In [12], Nilsson proposed the probabilistic logic in which the truth values of logical propositions

Using nCB films adsorbed on MoS 2 substrates studied by x-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and
","Using nCB films adsorbed on MoS 2 substrates studied by x-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, we demonstrate that ordered interfaces with well-defined orientations of adsorbed dipoles induce planar anchoring locked along the adsorbed dipoles or the alkyl chains, which play the role of easy axes. For two alternating orientations of the adsorbed dipoles or dipoles and alkyl chains, bi-stability of anchoring can be obtained.

The results are explained using the introduction of fourth order terms in the phenomenological anchoring potential, leading to the demonstration of first order anchoring transition in these systems. Using this phenomenological anchoring potential, we finally show how the nature of anchoring in presence of dual easy axes (inducing bi-stability or average orientation between the two easy axes) can be related to the microscopical nature of the interface.

Introduction Understanding the interactions between liquid crystal (LC) and a solid substrate is of clear applied interest, the vast majority of LC displays relying on control of interfaces. However this concerns also fundamental problems like wetting phenomena and all phenomena of orientation of soft matter bulk induced by the presence of an interface. In LCs at interfaces, the so-called easy axes correspond to the favoured orientations of the LC director close to the interface. If one easy axis only is defined for one given interface, the bulk director orients along or close to this axis [1]. It is well known that, in anchoring phenomena, two major effects compete to impose the anchoring directions of a liquid crystal, first, the interactions between molecules and the interface, second, the substrate roughness whose role has been analyzed by Berreman [2]. The influence of adsorbed molecular functional groups at the interface is most often dominant with, for example in carbon substrates, a main influence of unsaturated carbon bonds orientation at the interface [3]. In common LC displays, there is one unique easy axis, but modifications of surfaces have allowed for the discovery of promising new anchoring-related properties. For instance, the first anchoring bi-stability has been established on rough surfaces, associated with electric ordo-polarization [4] and the competition between a stabilizing short-range term and a destabilizing long-range term induced by an external field, can induce a continuous variation of anchoring orientation [5]. More recently, surfaces with several easy axes have been studied extensively. It has been shown that control of a continuous variation of director pretilt, obtained in several systems [6, 7], is associated with the presence of two different easy axes, one perpendicular to the substrate (homeotropic) and one planar [7, 8].

Similar models can explain the continuous evolution of anchoring between two planar orientations observed on some crystalline substrates [9]. However, in the same time, two easy axes can also lead to anchoring bi-stability [10, 11] or discontinuous transitions of anchoring [9], which is not compatible with the model established to interpret observed control of pretilt. In order to be able to predict if bi-stability or continuous combination of the two easy axes occurs for one given system, it becomes necessary to understand the microscopic origin of the easy axes.","(587, 17)","In this paper, we investigate the characteristics and behavior of ordered interfaces in liquid crystals with dual easy axes. This combination of properties is known to induce a number of complex and interesting phenomena, including domain formation, phase transitions, and the emergence of topological defects.

To begin, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of dual easy axes in nematic liquid crystals. We describe the different types of ordering that can occur in these systems, including homogenous and patterned alignments. We also discuss how external fields and boundary conditions can be used to control and manipulate the ordering of the liquid crystal.

We then turn our attention to the experimental study of dual easy axes in liquid crystals. Using a combination of microscopy and scattering techniques, we analyze the structures and dynamics of ordered interfaces. We find that the ordering of the liquid crystal displays a rich variety of behavior, including the formation of complex textures such as stripes and walls.

One particularly interesting phenomenon that arises from the combination of dual easy axes and ordered interfaces is the formation of topological defects. These defects can take on a number of different forms, including disclinations and dislocations, and have been shown to have important implications for the properties and behavior of the liquid crystal.

We also investigate the effect of confined geometries on the ordering of dual easy axes in liquid crystals. By studying the behavior of these systems in thin films and droplets, we are able to gain insight into how the ordering is affected by the presence of surfaces and interfaces. We find that the confinement induces a number of new and unexpected effects, including the formation of new types of topological defects and the emergence of novel phase behavior.

Overall, our study demonstrates that the combination of dual easy axes and ordered interfaces in liquid crystals is a rich and complex field of study with a number of important implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. Our research contributes to a growing body of knowledge on these fascinating systems and paves the way for future research in this area.","(383, 15)","Using nCB films adsorbed on MoS 2 substrates studied by x-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and
scanning electron microscopy, we demonstrate the formation of ordered interfaces for dual easy
axes in liquid crystals (LCs). The nCB films were prepared by spin-coating a solution of nCB in
chloroform onto MoS 2 /SiO 2 /Si substrates. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the nCB
molecules were oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface. Optical microscopy and scanning
electron microscopy images revealed that the nCB molecules formed a monolayer on the MoS 2
substrate. The LC molecules were aligned parallel to the nCB monolayer due to the strong
interactions between the nCB molecules and the LC molecules. The dual easy axes of the LC
molecules were determined by the orientation of the nCB molecules. This work provides a new
approach for controlling the alignment of LC molecules and may have potential applications in
liquid crystal displays and other optoelectronic devices.","(165, 7)","Using nCB films adsorbed on MoS 2 substrates studied by x-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and

crystallization of nCB films. We have found that the orientation of the substrate has a significant
influence on the crystallization of the nCB film. When the substrate is oriented with the easy axis
parallel to the surface of the substrate, the nCB films crystallize along the easy axis. When the
substrate is oriented with its easy axis perpendicular to the substrate surface, the films crystallize
along the easy axis of the substrate. We have also found that the substrate orientation has a
significant influence on the morphology of the crystallized films. The films crystallized with the
easy axis parallel to the substrate have a hexagonal morphology, whereas the films crystallized
with the easy axis perpendicular have a rhombohedral morphology. The substrate orientation also has
a significant influence on the optical properties of the films. When the easy axis is parallel to the
surface of the substrate the films have a high transmittance in the visible region of the spectrum
and a low reflectance in the infrared region. When the films are oriented with their easy axis
perpendicular to the substrate, they have a low transmittance and a high reflectance in both the

Virtualization allows the simulation of automotive ECUs on a Windows PC executing in closed-loop with
","Virtualization allows the simulation of automotive ECUs on a Windows PC executing in closed-loop with a vehicle simulation model. This approach enables to move certain development tasks from road or test rigs and HiL (Hardware in the loop) to PCs, where they can often be performed faster and cheaper. Renault has recently established such a virtualization process for powertrain control software based on Simulink models. If the number of runnables exceeds a threshold (about 1500) the execution of the virtual ECU is no longer straight forward and specific techniques are required. This paper describes the motivation behind a Simulink model based process, the virtualization process and applications of the resulting virtual ECUs. Domain: Critical Transportation Systems Topic: Processes, methods and tools, in particular: virtual engineering and simulation 1. Motivation Since 2010, Renault has established a framework to develop engine control software for Diesel and Gasoline engines [6]. The framework is heavily based on MATLAB/Simulink and the idea of model-based development, which facilitates the carry-over and carry-across of application software between software projects. In the Renault EMS architecture software is composed in to about 20 functions, such as Air System, Combustion etc. A function consists of modules. A module is the smallest testable software unit and contains runnables to be scheduled and executed by the Operating System (Os) of the ECU. The Renault EMS development process includes basically the following steps [5]. 1. Specification of about 200 generic configurable modules per ECU using MATLAB/Simulink. 2. Generation of C code (EMS application software) from all module specifications using MATLAB/Simulink Embedded Coder.

3. MiL (Model in the Loop) test and validation of the resulting executable specifications at module level in a simulated system environment, considering only essential interactions with other modules and system environment. This is essentially a back-to-back test to make sure that the Simulink model of a module and the corresponding production C code show equivalent and intended behaviour. To insure software quality, this step is repeatedly performed with steps 1 and 2, based on the simulation capabilities of MATLAB/Simulink. 4.

Configuration of modules to fit to the specific needs of a software project, such as absence or presence of certain components. 5. Integration of generated configured C code and hand-coded platform software (basic software) on supplied target hardware, a real ECU that communicates with other controllers via CAN and other busses. 6. Validation and test of all modules on system level using the real ECU. In contrast to step 3, the interactions of all modules and interactions with the system environment are visible then and subject to testing. For example, the Os runs all scheduled runnables then, not just those of the modules considered to be 'essential' for a module under test. Critical assessment of the above process shows that there is a considerable delay between delivery of a set of specifications to the software project team (at the end of step 3) and system-level tests based on an ECU that runs entire software (step 6). Typical delays are weeks or months.","(572, 30)","This paper presents a comprehensive study on the full virtualization of Renault's engine management software and its application to system development. The aim of the research is to investigate the feasibility of complete system virtualization for engine control systems, which will allow more flexibility and assess the practicality of this approach for software development in the automotive industry.

To achieve this goal, a detailed analysis of the Renault engine management system architecture is performed, including its various components and sub-systems. This analysis helps identify the key characteristics and features that require consideration when creating a virtualized system.

The research then proposes a virtualization architecture based on various virtualization techniques, such as hardware-level virtualization, kernel-level virtualization, and system-level virtualization. This architecture is designed specifically for Renault's engine management system, taking into account the unique characteristics of the system.

Several virtualization prototypes are developed and implemented on the proposed architecture to identify potential issues in the virtualization process and to evaluate the performance of the virtualized system. The results of these tests show that full virtualization of Renault's engine management software is feasible and can be a promising approach for system development in the automotive industry.

Furthermore, the paper explores the benefits of virtualization in relation to software development and analyzes the potential implications for Renault's development process. The paper highlights the potential for quicker development cycles, improved software testing, and better fault isolation among other benefits. Moreover, through this virtualization, developers can build, test, and deploy various software updates to Renault engines more efficiently.

Finally, the research concludes with an outlook on the future of full virtualization in the automotive industry and potential directions that future research can take. The study builds a fundamental understanding that can serve as a basis for future investigations into virtualization approaches for engine management systems.

Overall, this paper presents a detailed analysis of full virtualization of Renault's engine management software and its application to system development.

One Monad to Prove Them All is a modern fairy tale about curiosity and perseverance,
","One Monad to Prove Them All is a modern fairy tale about curiosity and perseverance, two important properties of a successful PhD student. We follow the PhD student Mona on her adventure of proving properties about Haskell programs in the proof assistant Coq. On the one hand, as a PhD student in computer science Mona observes an increasing demand for correct software products. In particular, because of the large amount of existing software, verifying existing software products becomes more important. Verifying programs in the functional programming language Haskell is no exception. On the other hand, Mona is delighted to see that communities in the area of theorem proving are becoming popular. Thus, Mona sets out to learn more about the interactive theorem prover Coq and verifying Haskell programs in Coq. To prove properties about a Haskell function in Coq, Mona has to translate the function into Coq code. As Coq programs have to be total and Haskell programs are often not, Mona has to model partiality explicitly in Coq. In her quest for a solution Mona finds an ancient manuscript that explains how properties about Haskell functions can be proven in the proof assistant Agda by translating Haskell programs into monadic Agda programs. By instantiating the monadic program with a concrete monad instance the proof can be performed in either a total or a partial setting. Mona discovers that the proposed transformation does not work in Coq due to a restriction in the termination checker. In fact the transformation does not work in Agda anymore as well, as the termination checker in Agda has been improved. We follow Mona on an educational journey through the land of functional programming where she learns about concepts like free monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof assistants like Coq. These concepts are well-known individually, but their interplay gives rise to a solution for Mona's problem based on the originally proposed monadic tranformation that has not been presented before. When Mona starts to test her approach by proving a statement about simple Haskell functions, she realizes that her approach has an additional advantage over the original idea in Agda. Mona's final solution not only works for a specific monad instance but even allows her to prove monad-generic properties. Instead of proving properties over and over again for specific monad instances she is able to prove properties that hold for all monads representable by a container-based instance of the free monad. In order to strengthen her confidence in the practicability of her approach, Mona evaluates her approach in a case study that compares two implementations for queues. In order to share the results with other functional programmers the fairy tale is available as a literate Coq file. If you are a citizen of the land of functional programming or are at least familiar with its customs, had a journey that involved reasoning about functional programs of your own, or are just a curious soul looking for the next story about monads and proofs, then this tale is for you.","(546, 21)","The concept of a ""monad"" has been used across multiple fields and disciplines throughout history, from Western philosophy to computer science.

In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized function. Choosing a neural network
","In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized function. Choosing a neural network architecture for any task is as complex as searching the space of those functions. For the last few years, 'neural architecture design' has been largely synonymous with 'neural architecture search' (NAS), i.e. brute-force, large-scale search. NAS has yielded significant gains on practical tasks. However, NAS methods end up searching for a local optimum in architecture space in a small neighborhood around architectures that often go back decades, based on CNN or LSTM.

In this work, we present a different and complementary approach to architecture design, which we term 'zero-shot architecture design' (ZSAD). We develop methods that can predict, without any training, whether an architecture will achieve a relatively high test or training error on a task after training.

We then go on to explain the error in terms of the architecture definition itself and develop tools for modifying the architecture based on this explanation. This confers an unprecedented level of control on the deep learning practitioner. They can make informed design decisions before the first line of code is written, even for tasks for which no prior art exists.

Our first major contribution is to show that the 'degree of nonlinearity' of a neural architecture is a key causal driver behind its performance, and a primary aspect of the architecture's model complexity. We introduce the 'nonlinearity coefficient' (NLC), a scalar metric for measuring nonlinearity.

Via extensive empirical study, we show that the value of the NLC in the architecture's randomly initialized state before training is a powerful predictor of test error after training and that attaining a right-sized NLC is essential for attaining an optimal test error. The NLC is also conceptually simple, well-defined for any feedforward network, easy and cheap to compute, has extensive theoretical, empirical and conceptual grounding, follows instructively from the architecture definition, and can be easily controlled via our 'nonlinearity normalization' algorithm. We argue that the NLC is the most powerful scalar statistic for architecture design specifically and neural network analysis in general. Our analysis is fueled by mean field theory, which we use to uncover the 'meta-distribution' of layers.

Beyond the NLC, we uncover and flesh out a range of metrics and properties that have a significant explanatory influence on test and training error. We go on to explain the majority of the error variation across a wide range of randomly generated architectures with these metrics and properties. We compile our insights into a practical guide for architecture designers, which we argue can significantly shorten the trial-and-error phase of deep learning deployment.

Our results are grounded in an experimental protocol that exceeds that of the vast majority of other deep learning studies in terms of carefulness and rigor.

We study the impact of e.g. dataset, learning rate, floating-point precision, loss function, statistical estimation error and batch inter-dependency on performance and other key properties. We promote research practices that we believe can significantly accelerate progress in architecture design research.","(565, 24)","The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been revolutionized by the concept of the nonlinearity coefficient (NLC). The NLC is a measure of the nonlinearity of the activation functions used in the hidden layers of an ANN. The use of an optimal NLC value in designing ANNs can improve their performance by minimizing overfitting and increasing generalization accuracy.

In this paper, we present a practical guide to designing neural architectures using the NLC. We begin with an overview of the fundamental concepts of ANNs and their activation functions. We then introduce the concept of the NLC and explain how it can be determined for a given ANN architecture. 

Next, we present experimental results based on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the NLC in improving the performance of ANNs. We also compare the performance of ANNs designed using the NLC with those designed using other traditional methods, such as regularization and early stopping.

Furthermore, we provide guidelines for selecting an appropriate NLC value based on the complexity of the dataset, the size of the training dataset, and the optimization algorithm used.

Lastly, we discuss the limitations of using the NLC in neural architecture design, such as the high computational cost of calculating NLC and the dependence of the optimal NLC on the dataset and architecture used.

In conclusion, this paper provides a comprehensive guide to using the NLC in neural architecture design. The practical guidelines and experimental results presented here demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating the NLC into the design process to improve the performance of ANNs.","(285, 12)","In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized function.

User-defined syntax extensions are useful to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) with good
","User-defined syntax extensions are useful to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) with good code-readability. They allow EDSL authors to define domain-natural notation, which is often different from the host language syntax. Nowadays, there are several research works of powerful user-defined syntax extensions. One promising approach uses user-defined operators. A user-defined operator is a function with user-defined syntax. It can be regarded as a syntax extension implemented without macros. An advantage of user-defined operators is that an operator can be statically typed. The compiler can find type errors in the definition of an operator before the operator is used. In addition, the compiler can resolve syntactic ambiguities by using static types. However, user-defined operators are difficult to implement language constructs involving static name binding. Name binding is association between names and values (or memory locations). Our inquiry is whether we can design a system for user-defined operators involving a new custom name binding. This paper proposes a module system for user-defined operators named a dsl class. A dsl class is similar to a normal class in Java but it contains operators instead of methods. We use operators for implementing custom name binding. For example, we use a nullary operator for emulating a variable name. An instance of a dsl class, called a dsl object, reifies an environment that expresses name binding. Programmers can control a scope of instance operators by specifying where the dsl object is active. We extend the host type system so that it can express the activation of a dsl object. In our system, a bound name is propagated through a type parameter to a dsl object.

This enables us to implement user-defined language constructs involving static name binding. A contribution of this paper is that we reveal we can integrate a system for managing names and their scopes with a module and type system of an object-oriented language like Java. This allows us to implement a proposed system by adopting eager disambiguation based on expected types so that the compilation time will be acceptable. Eager disambiguation, which prunes out semantically invalid abstract parsing trees (ASTs) while a parser is running, is needed because the parser may generate a huge number of potentially valid ASTs for the same source code. We have implemented ProteaJ2, which is a programming language based on Java and it supports our proposal. We describe a parsing method that adopts eager disambiguation for fast parsing and discuss its time complexity. To show the practicality of our proposal, we have conducted two micro benchmarks to see the performance of our compiler. We also show several use cases of dsl classes for demonstrating dsl classes can express various language constructs. Our ultimate goal is to let programmers add any kind of new language construct to a host language. To do this, programmers should be able to define new syntax, name binding, and type system within the host language. This paper shows programmers can define the former two: their own syntax and name binding.","(552, 31)","This paper discusses the implementation of user-defined operators and name binding for new language constructs. The proposed approach allows programmers to define their own operators, customized to the domain-specific needs of their applications. The main goal is to enable a concise and natural expression of complex operations, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.

The paper presents a formal specification of the syntax and semantics of the proposed extension, and provides a reference implementation based on a modified version of an existing language. The operators are defined using a declarative syntax similar to that of functions or procedures. The syntax specifies the precedence and associativity of the operators, as well as their arity and argument types. The implementation uses a parser generator to automatically generate a parser for the extended grammar.

To enable name binding for user-defined operators, the paper proposes a novel mechanism that uses a combination of dynamic scoping and type inference. The mechanism allows the compiler to infer the types and binding scopes of variables based on their usage within the operator, thus avoiding the need for explicit type annotations or variable declarations. This makes the programming model more expressive and less error-prone, while still preserving type safety and compile-time correctness.

The paper also discusses the benefits and limitations of the proposed approach, and presents several examples of how the new operators can be used to simplify and clarify program logic. The examples include arithmetic and logical operations, string manipulation, and collection processing. The paper concludes with a discussion of future work, including the extension of the mechanism to support user-defined control structures and the integration of the approach into other programming languages. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly enhance the productivity and clarity of software development, particularly for domain-specific applications that require customized operators and abstractions.","(329, 14)","User-defined syntax extensions are useful to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) with good

It is also proven that each commutative ring R whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat is of $\lambda$-dimension $\le$ 3, and this dimension $\le$ 2 if R is local. This extends a former result about the class of arithmetical rings. Moreover, if R has a unique minimal prime ideal then its finitely generated ideals are quasi-projective if they are quasi-flat. In [1] Abuhlail, Jarrar and Kabbaj studied the class of commutative fqp-rings (finitely generated ideals are quasi-projective). They proved that this class of rings strictly contains the one of arithmetical rings and is strictly contained in the one of Gaussian rings. It is also shown that the property for a commutative ring to be fqp is preserved by localization. It is known that a commutative ring R is arithmetical (resp. Gaussian) if and only if R M is arithmetical (resp. Gaussian) for each maximal ideal M of R. But an example given in [6] shows that a commutative ring which is a locally fqp-ring is not necessarily a fqp-ring. So, in this cited paper the class of fqf-rings is introduced. Each local commutative fqf-ring is a fqp-ring, and a commutative ring is fqf if and only if it is locally fqf. These fqf-rings are defined in [6] without a definition of quasi-flat modules. Here we propose a definition of these modules and another definition of fqf-ring which is equivalent to the one given in [6]. We also introduce the module property of self-flatness. Each quasi-flat module is self-flat but we do not know if the converse holds. On the other hand, each flat module is quasi-flat and any finitely generated module is quasi-flat if and only if it is flat modulo its annihilator. In Section 2 we give a complete characterization of local commutative rings for which each ideal is self-flat. These rings R are fqp and their nilradical N is the subset of zerodivisors of R. In the case where R is not a chain ring for which N = N 2 and R N is not coherent every ideal is flat modulo its annihilator. Then in Section 3 we deduce that any ideal of a chain ring (valuation ring) R is quasi-projective if and only if it is almost maximal and each zerodivisor is nilpotent. This complete the results obtained by Hermann in [11] on valuation domains. In Section 4 we show that each commutative fqf-ring is of $\lambda$-dimension $\le$ 3. This extends the result about arithmetical rings obtained in [4]. Moreover it is shown that this $\lambda$-dimension is $\le$ 2 in the local case. But an example of a local Gaussian ring R of $\lambda$-dimension $\ge$ 3 is given.","(559, 27)","Commutative rings whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat have received significant attention in the context of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. In particular, they play an important role in the study of algebraic varieties and their singularities.

This paper studies a class of commutative rings such that all their finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat. We explore the basic properties of such rings, and provide several equivalent characterizations of them. In particular, we show that a commutative ring R is such that all its finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat if and only if R satisfies certain coherence conditions.

We also investigate the relationship between these rings and various other classes of commutative rings, such as universally catenary rings and integral domains that admit a dualizing complex. We provide examples to illustrate that the class of commutative rings whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat is strictly larger than the class of universally catenary rings, and that not all such rings admit a dualizing complex.

Finally, we study the local cohomology of modules over commutative rings whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat. We prove that if R is such a ring and M is a finitely generated module over R, then the local cohomology of M with respect to an ideal I in R is finite-dimensional for any finitely generated ideal I in R. We also investigate the relationship between the finiteness of local cohomology and the Bass property for modules over commutative rings whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat.

Throughout the paper, we use a variety of techniques both from algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, including homological algebra, sheaf theory, and the theory of determinantal rings.

We analyze some parabolic PDEs with different drift terms which are gradient flows in the
","We analyze some parabolic PDEs with different drift terms which are gradient flows in the Wasserstein space and consider the corresponding discrete-in-time JKO scheme. We prove with optimal transport techniques how to control the L p and L $\infty$ norms of the iterated solutions in terms of the previous norms, essentially recovering well-known results obtained on the continuous-in-time equations. Then we pass to higher order results, and in particulat to some specific BV and Sobolev estimates, where the JKO scheme together with the so-called ""five gradients inequality"" allows to recover some inequalities that can be deduced from the Bakry-Emery theory for diffusion operators, but also to obtain some novel ones, in particular for the Keller-Segel chemiotaxis model. 1 Short introduction The goal of this paper is to present some estimates on evolution PDEs in the space of probability densities which share two important features: they include a linear diffusion term, and they are gradient flows in the Wasserstein space W2. These PDEs will be of the form $\partial$t$\rho$ -- $\Delta$$\rho$ -- $\nabla$ $\times$ ($\rho$$\nabla$u[$\rho$]) = 0, complemented with no-flux boundary conditions and an intial condition on $\rho$0. We will in particular concentrate on the Fokker-Plack case, where u[$\rho$] = V and V is a fixed function (with possible regularity assumptions) independent of $\rho$, on the case where u[$\rho$] = W * $\rho$ is obtained by convolution and models interaction between particles, and on the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel case where u[$\rho$] is related to $\rho$ via an elliptic equation. This last case models the evolution of a biological population $\rho$ subject to diffusion but attracted by the concentration of a chemo-attractant, a nutrient which is produced by the population itself, so that its distribution is ruled by a PDE where the density $\rho$ appears as a source term. Under the assumption that the production rate of this nutrient is much faster than the motion of the cells, we can assume that its distribution is ruled by a statical PDE with no explicit time-dependence, and gives rise to a system which is a gradient flow in the variable $\rho$ (the parabolic-parabolic case, where the time scale for the cells and for the nutrient are comparable, is also a gradient flow, in the product space W2 x L 2 , but we will not consider this case). Since we mainly concentrate on the case of bounded domains, in the Keller-Segel case the term u[$\rho$] cannot be expressed as a convoluton and requires ad-hoc computations.

In all the paper, the estimates will be studied on a time-discretized version of these PDEs, consisting in the so-called JKO (Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto) scheme, based on iterated optimization problems involving the Wasserstein distance W2. We will first present 0-order estimates, on the L p and L $\infty$ norms of the solution. This is just a translation into the JKO language of well-known properties of these equations. The main goal of this part is hence to","(595, 13)","This research paper delves on the estimation of solutions of Fokker-Planck equations - a powerful mathematical tool that models diffusion phenomena. Our focus is on linear and non-linear Fokker-Planck equations, where we show the robustness of the JKO scheme. In particular, we extend estimates for JKO schemes in both the linear and non-linear cases and prove that they converge for the respective PDEs. Our results offer an innovative approach to tackle diffusion phenomena, and the linear/non-linear cases of Fokker-Planck equations are vital in various research applications.

Furthermore, we explore the application of these estimates to non-linear Keller-Segel models, which model chemotactic phenomena in biology. We study the dynamics of the concentration of cells in a both finite and infinite domain, while incorporating a particular chemotactic sensitivity function, where previously known estimates have failed. We demonstrate that the application of JKO schemes provides new and sharp Lp and Sobolev bounds which help to obtain better estimates in the chemotactic system. Our results are instrumental in unveiling critical dynamics of the chemotactic reaction-diffusion equations.

Our study explores various numerical experiments that provide evidence of the efficiency of our scheme. We demonstrate that the estimates provided by the JKO scheme in explicit numerical simulations match very closely the exact solutions of the PDEs. Our experiments support the conclusion that JKO estimates are reliable and offer valuable insights for the analysis of non-linear PDEs.

To conclude, our paper contributes to the understanding of diffusion phenomena and offers an innovative approach to estimate solutions of both linear and non-linear Fokker-Planck equations. Our method is also proven to be valuable in the application of Keller-Segel models, and we provide new results of Lp and Sobolev bounds that are imperative to better understand chemotactic phenomena. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach is reliable and effective in practice. This research may have significant practical applications in both biological and physical sciences.","(338, 15)","We analyze some parabolic PDEs with different drift terms which are gradient flows in the
sense of Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO). We show that the JKO scheme can be used to obtain
$L^p$ and $W^{1,p}$ bounds for the solutions of these PDEs. In particular, we consider the
Fokker–Planck equation with a linear drift term and the Keller–Segel equation with a nonlinear
drift term. We show that the solutions of these equations are bounded in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and
$W^{1,p}(\mathbb{ R}^n)$ for all $p\in [1,\infty)$. We also show that the solutions are bounded in
$W^{2,p}(\mathcal{D})$ for any bounded domain $\mathcal{D}\subset \mathbb{R }^n$. These results
are obtained by applying the JKO scheme to the corresponding PDEs. The JKO scheme is a
discretization method that approximates the solution of a PDE by minimizing a sequence of
energy functionals. The energy functionals are chosen such that the minimizers converge to the
solution of the PDE as the discretization parameter goes to zero. In our case, the energy
functionals are chosen to be of the form $\int_{\mathcal{D}}|\nabla u|^p dx$, where $u$ is the
approximation of the solution of the PDE. This choice of energy functional ensures that the
minimizers have the desired regularity properties. The main difficulty in applying the JKO
scheme to these PDEs is that the drift terms are not Lipschitz continuous. However, we show
that the drift terms can be approximated by Lipschitz continuous functions, which allows us to
apply the JKO scheme. Our results provide new insights into the behavior of solutions of these
PDEs and may be of interest to researchers in the field of partial differential equations.","(354, 13)",,

The relation between Science (what we can explain) and Art (what we can't) has long
","The relation between Science (what we can explain) and Art (what we can't) has long been acknowledged and while every science contains an artistic part, every art form also needs a bit of science. Among all scientific disciplines, programming holds a special place for two reasons. First, the artistic part is not only undeniable but also essential. Second, and much like in a purely artistic discipline, the act of programming is driven partly by the notion of aesthetics: the pleasure we have in creating beautiful things. Even though the importance of aesthetics in the act of programming is now unquestioned, more could still be written on the subject. The field called ""psychology of programming"" focuses on the cognitive aspects of the activity, with the goal of improving the productivity of programmers. While many scientists have emphasized their concern for aesthetics and the impact it has on their activity, few computer scientists have actually written about their thought process while programming. What makes us like or dislike such and such language or paradigm? Why do we shape our programs the way we do? By answering these questions from the angle of aesthetics, we may be able to shed some new light on the art of programming. Starting from the assumption that aesthetics is an inherently transversal dimension, it should be possible for every programmer to find the same aesthetic driving force in every creative activity they undertake, not just programming, and in doing so, get deeper insight on why and how they do things the way they do. On the other hand, because our aesthetic sensitivities are so personal, all we can really do is relate our own experiences and share it with others, in the hope that it will inspire them to do the same. My personal life has been revolving around three major creative activities, of equal importance: programming in Lisp, playing Jazz music, and practicing Aikido. But why so many of them, why so different ones, and why these specifically? By introspecting my personal aesthetic sensitivities, I eventually realized that my tastes in the scientific, artistic, and physical domains are all motivated by the same driving forces, hence unifying Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido as three expressions of a single essence, not so different after all. Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are governed by a limited set of rules which remain simple and unobtrusive. Conforming to them is a pleasure. Because Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are inherently introspective disciplines, they also invite you to transgress the rules in order to find your own. Breaking the rules is fun.

Finally, if Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido unify so many paradigms, styles, or techniques, it is not by mere accumulation but because they live at the meta-level and let you reinvent them. Working at the meta-level is an enlightening experience. Understand your aesthetic sensitivities and you may gain considerable insight on your own psychology of programming. Mine is perhaps common to most lispers. Perhaps also common to other programming communities, but that, is for the reader to decide...","(579, 24)","This paper seeks to explore the intersections between the seemingly disparate fields of Lisp programming, jazz music, and the martial art of Aikido, ultimately arguing that they each express a fundamental and interconnected aspect of the human experience. This argument is based on a thorough and multifaceted analysis of each field, drawing on a range of theoretical and practical perspectives.

In the case of Lisp programming, this paper contends that the language's unique focus on recursion and abstraction reflects a deeply ingrained human tendency to seek out patterns and create mental models of the world around us. Drawing on both historical and contemporary examples, the paper demonstrates how Lisp has been used to solve complex computational problems and push the boundaries of artificial intelligence research.

Similarly, the paper argues that jazz music represents a powerful means of embodying and exploring the complex interplay between structure and improvisation. By examining the techniques and philosophies of jazz musicians such as John Coltrane and Miles Davis, the paper shows how the genre's emphasis on creative collaboration and spontaneous innovation can help us to better understand the dynamics of social interaction and teamwork.

Finally, the paper turns to the martial art of Aikido, which it argues provides a profound physical and philosophical framework for exploring the fundamental nature of conflict and harmony. By drawing on insights from both traditional Japanese knowledge and contemporary psychology research, the paper demonstrates how Aikido can illuminate important aspects of human relationships and allow us to develop more effective strategies for resolving conflicts.

Taken together, these three distinct fields of inquiry represent different expressions of a single underlying essence or principle, which can be understood through an integration of theory and practice across multiple domains. The paper concludes by exploring some of the broader implications of this argument for fields such as education, psychology, and philosophy, suggesting that a deeper appreciation of the interconnections between seemingly disparate disciplines is essential for addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today.","(360, 10)","The relation between Science (what we can explain) and Art (what we can't) has long
been a topic of debate. In this paper, we will explore three different expressions of
this relationship: Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido. We will argue that these three disciplines
share a common essence, and that understanding this essence can help us to better
understand the relationship between Science and Art.
Lisp is a programming language that was developed in the 1950s. It is known for its
expressive power and its ability to represent complex data structures. Jazz is a
musical genre that emerged in the early 20th century. It is characterized by its
improvisational nature and its use of complex rhythms and harmonies. Aikido is a
martial art that was developed in Japan in the 1920s. It emphasizes the use of
harmonious movements to neutralize an opponent's attack.
All three of these disciplines share a common essence: they are all based on the
principles of harmony and balance. In Lisp, this is reflected in the way that the
language allows for the expression of complex data structures. In Jazz, it is
reflected in the way that musicians improvise together, creating a harmonious
whole. In Aikido, it is reflected in the use of harmonious movements to deflect an
opponent's attack.
This common essence can be seen as a bridge between Science and Art. Science is
based on the principles of cause and effect, while Art is based on the principles of
harmony and balance. By understanding this common essence, we can begin to see how
Science and Art are actually two sides of the same coin.","(304, 16)",,

In two articles ([Brisson-Ofman1, 2]), we have analyzed the so-called 'mathematical passage' of Plato's Theaetetus,
","In two articles ([Brisson-Ofman1, 2]), we have analyzed the so-called 'mathematical passage' of Plato's Theaetetus, the first dialogue of a trilogy including the Sophist and the Statesman. In the present article, we study an important point in more detail, the 'definition' of 'powers' ('$\delta\upsilon\nu\acute\alpha\mu\epsilon\iota\varsigma$'). While in [Brisson-Ofman2], it was shown that the different steps to get the definition are mathematically and philosophically incorrect, it is explained why the definition itself is problematic. However, it is the first example, at least in the trilogy, of a definition by division. This point is generally ignored by modern commentators though, as we will try to show, it gives rise, in a mathematical context, to at least three fundamental questions: the meaning(s) of 'logos', the connection between 'elements and compound' and, of course the question of the 'power(s)'. One of the main consequences of our works on Theaetetus' 'mathematical passage', including the present one, is to challenge the so-called 'main standard interpretation'. In particular, following [Ofman2014], we question the claim that Plato praises and glorifies both the mathematician Theodorus and the young Theaetetus. According to our analysis, such a claim, considered as self-evident, entails many errors. Conversely, our analysis of Theaetetus' mathematical mistakes highlights the main cause of some generally overlooked failures in the dialogue: the forgetting of the 'logos', first in the 'mathematical part', then in the following discussion, and finally the failure of the four successive tries of its definition at the end of the dialogue. Namely, as we will show, the passage is closely connected with the problems studied at the end of the dialogue, but also to the two other parts of the trilogy through the method of 'definition by division'. Finally, if our conclusions are different from the usual ones, it is probably because the passage is analyzed, maybe for the first time, simultaneously from the philosophical, historical and mathematical points of view. It had been considered usually either as an excursus by historians of philosophy (for instance [Burnyeat1978]), or as an isolated text separated from the rest of the dialogue by historians of mathematics (for instance [Knorr1975]), or lastly as a pretext to discuss some astute developments in modern mathematics by mathematicians (for instance [Kahane1985]).[Brisson-Ofman1]: Luc Brisson-Salomon Ofman, `Theodorus' lesson in Plato's Theaetetus(147d3-d6) Revisited-A New Perspective', to appear[Brisson-Ofman2]: Luc Brisson-Salomon Ofman, `The Philosophical Interpretation of Plato'sTheaetetus and the Final Part of the Mathematical Lesson (147d7-148b)', to appear[Burnyeat 1978]: Myles Burnyeat, `The Philosophical Sense of Theaetetus' Mathematics',Isis, 69, 1978, 489-514[Kahane1985]: Jean-Pierre Kahane, `la th{\'e}orie de Th{\'e}odore des corps quadratiques r{\'e}els',L'enseignement math{\'e}matique, 31, 1985, p.

The work analyzes the dialogue between Socrates and Theaetetus as they delve into the intricacies of mathematical knowledge, particularly the relationship between powers and roots and the concept of division. The paper situates the dialogue within the larger context of Plato's philosophy, including his views on the nature of knowledge and the role of mathematics in understanding the world. 

The first section of the paper provides an overview of the mathematical concepts discussed in the dialogue, including the identification of perfect squares and the calculation of powers. The authors analyze the initial definition of a power, which is presented in terms of repeated multiplication, and examine the relationship between powers and roots. They also discuss the concept of division in relation to powers, exploring the role of ratios and proportionality in mathematical calculations.

The second section of the paper situates the dialogue within a broader philosophical framework. The authors draw on Plato's views of knowledge and epistemology, particularly his belief in the existence of objective, eternal forms or ideas. They argue that the mathematical concepts explored in the dialogue can be seen as a reflection of these higher forms, and that the act of understanding mathematics involves a process of recollection and discovery. 

The final section of the paper considers the implications of the discussion for contemporary philosophy and mathematics. The authors argue that the problems and concepts explored in the dialogue remain relevant today, particularly in the fields of algebra, geometry, and number theory. They suggest that the dialogue can be seen as a precursor to modern mathematical thinking, with its emphasis on abstraction, generalization, and proof.

Through close analysis of the dialogue between Socrates and Theaetetus, the paper explores the intricate relationships between different mathematical concepts and situates them within the larger context of Plato's philosophy. The authors suggest that the dialogue remains a rich source of insight and inspiration for contemporary philosophers and mathematicians alike, and that its enduring relevance speaks to the continued importance of mathematical thinking in understanding the world around us.","(417, 15)","In two articles ([Brisson-Ofman1, 2]), we have analyzed the so-called'mathematical passage' of Plato's Theaetetus,
in which Socrates and Theaetetus engage in a dialogue about the nature of mathematical knowledge.
In this paper, we will focus on one particular aspect of this dialogue: the discussion of powers and division.
We will argue that this discussion sheds light on Plato's conception of mathematical knowledge and its relation to other forms of knowledge.
We will also discuss the implications of this discussion for our understanding of Plato's philosophy as a whole.
First, let us consider the context in which this discussion takes place.
Theaetetus has just proposed a definition of knowledge as 'true belief with an account',
and Socrates has pointed out that this definition is problematic because it does not distinguish between different types of knowledge.
To illustrate this point, Socrates asks Theaetetus to explain what he means by 'account'.
Theaetetus replies that an account is a statement that explains why something is the case.
For example, the statement 'the square of two is four' is an account because it explains why the area of a square with side length two is four.
However, Socrates points out that this statement is not an account in the strict sense because it does not explain why the area of the square is four.
Rather, it assumes that the area is four without giving any reason for this assumption.
Socrates then suggests that what Theaetetus really means by 'account' is not a statement but a proof.
A proof is a sequence of statements that leads from a set of assumptions to a conclusion.
For example, a proof of the Pythagorean theorem might start with the assumption that the sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse,
and then use this assumption to show that the area of the triangle is equal to half the product of the lengths of the legs.
Socrates argues that this is a better definition of knowledge than Theaetetus's original definition because it captures the idea that knowledge is not just true belief but also justified true belief.
That is, knowledge requires not only that the belief is true but also that there is a good reason for thinking that it is true.
With this background in mind, let us now turn to the main topic of this paper: powers and division.
In the dialogue, Socrates introduces the concept of powers by asking Theaetetus whether he knows how to divide a square into two equal parts.

In this paper, we consider two cases of rolling of one smooth connected complete Riemannian
","In this paper, we consider two cases of rolling of one smooth connected complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ onto another one $(\hM,\hg)$ of equal dimension $n\geq 2$. The rolling problem $(NS)$ corresponds to the situation where there is no relative spin (or twist) of one manifold with respect to the other one. As for the rolling problem $(R)$, there is no relative spin and also no relative slip. Since the manifolds are not assumed to be embedded into an Euclidean space, we provide an intrinsic description of the two constraints ""without spinning"" and ""without slipping"" in terms of the Levi-Civita connections $\nabla^{g}$ and $\nabla^{\hg}$. For that purpose, we recast the two rolling problems within the framework of geometric control and associate to each of them a distribution and a control system. We then investigate the relationships between the two control systems and we address for both of them the issue of complete controllability. For the rolling $(NS)$, the reachable set (from any point) can be described exactly in terms of the holonomy groups of $(M,g)$ and $(\hM,\hg)$ respectively, and thus we achieve a complete understanding of the controllability properties of the corresponding control system. As for the rolling $(R)$, the problem turns out to be more delicate. We first provide basic global properties for the reachable set and investigate the associated Lie bracket structure. In particular, we point out the role played by a curvature tensor defined on the state space, that we call the \emph{rolling curvature}. In the case where one of the manifolds is a space form (let say $(\hM,\hg)$), we show that it is enough to roll along loops of $(M,g)$ and the resulting orbits carry a structure of principal bundle which preserves the rolling $(R)$ distribution. In the zero curvature case, we deduce that the rolling $(R)$ is completely controllable if and only if the holonomy group of $(M,g)$ is equal to SO(n). In the nonzero curvature case, we prove that the structure group of the principal bundle can be realized as the holonomy group of a connection on $TM\oplus \R$, that we call the rolling connection. We also show, in the case of positive (constant) curvature, that if the rolling connection is reducible, then $(M,g)$ admits, as Riemannian covering, the unit sphere with the metric induced from the Euclidean metric of $\R^{n+1}$. When the two manifolds are three-dimensional, we provide a complete local characterization of the reachable sets when the two manifolds are three-dimensional and, in particular, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a non open orbit. Besides the trivial case where the manifolds $(M,g)$ and $(\hM,\hg)$ are (locally) isometric, we show that (local) non controllability occurs if and only if $(M,g)$ and $(\hM,\hg)$ are either warped products or contact manifolds with additional restrictions that we precisely describe. Finally, we extend the two types of rolling to the case where the manifolds have different dimensions.","(660, 17)","The study of rolling manifolds, a type of manifold that is defined by its ability to roll without slipping, has received significant attention in recent years within the field of control theory. In this paper, we present an intrinsic formulation of rolling manifolds that considers their geometric and topological properties and explores the underlying mathematical structures that govern their behavior. 

Specifically, we use the theory of principal bundles to define a natural frame bundle for rolling manifolds, which allows us to express their dynamics in a coordinate-free way. This approach not only simplifies the analysis of rolling manifolds but also reveals essential features of their geometry, such as the existence of a connection on the frame bundle that characterizes the rolling motion.

We also investigate the controllability of rolling manifolds, which refers to the ability to reach any desired state in a finite amount of time by applying appropriate controls. Our results indicate that rolling manifolds are controllable for a large class of distributions on their tangent bundles, including those that correspond to regular and singular points. Moreover, we show that the notion of accessibility, i.e., the ability to reach any point in the configuration space, can be translated to a geometric condition on the curvature of the connection associated with the rolling motion.

To illustrate the applicability of our results, we provide several examples of rolling manifolds, including spheres, cylinders, and tori, and discuss their controllability properties in detail. In particular, we show how the curvature of the connection affects the motion of rolling manifolds and how this can be exploited to design optimal control strategies.

Finally, we discuss some open problems and future directions in the study of rolling manifolds. For instance, we highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between the geometric and dynamic properties of rolling manifolds and the role they play in the design of intelligent robotic systems. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive and rigorous treatment of rolling manifolds, which sheds light on their intrinsic formulation and controllability properties and paves the way for further research in this exciting area of control theory.","(383, 12)","In this paper, we consider two cases of rolling of one smooth connected complete Riemannian
manifold over another. In the first case, we assume that both manifolds have the same dimension,
and in the second case, we allow them to have different dimensions. We show that in both cases,
the rolling motion can be described by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) on the
Lie group of diffeomorphisms of the manifold being rolled. We then use this description to study
the controllability of the rolling motion. In particular, we show that the rolling motion is
controllable if and only if the Lie algebra of vector fields on the manifold being rolled is
involutive. Finally, we discuss some applications of our results, including the rolling of a sphere
over a plane and the rolling of a torus over a cylinder.","(156, 6)",,

Context. Refining or altering existing behavior is the daily work of every developer, but that
","Context. Refining or altering existing behavior is the daily work of every developer, but that cannot be always anticipated, and software sometimes cannot be stopped. In such cases, unanticipated adaptation of running systems is of interest for many scenarios, ranging from functional upgrades to on-the-fly debugging or monitoring of critical applications.

Inquiry. A way of altering software at run time is using behavioral reflection, which is particularly well-suited for unanticipated adaptation of real-world systems. Partial behavioral reflection is not a new idea, and for years many efforts have been made to propose a practical way of expressing it.

All these efforts resulted in practical solutions, but which introduced a semantic gap between the code that requires adaptation and the expression of the partial behavior. For example, in Aspect-Oriented Programming, a pointcut description is expressed in another language, which introduces a new distance between the behavior expression (the Advice) and the source code in itself.

Approach. Ten years ago, the idea of closing the gap between the code and the expression of the partial behavior led to the implementation of the Reflectivity framework. Using Reflectivity, developers annotate Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes with meta-behavior which is taken into account by the compiler to produce behavioral variations. In this paper, we present Reflectivity, its API, its implementation and its usage in Pharo. We reflect on ten years of use of Reflectivity, and show how it has been used as a basic building block of many innovative ideas.

Knowledge. Reflectivity brings a practical way of working at the AST level, which is a high-level representation of the source code manipulated by software developers. It enables a powerful way of dynamically add and modify behavior.

Reflectivity is also a flexible mean to bridge the gap between the expression of the meta-behavior and the source code. This ability to apply unanticipated adaptation and to provide behavioral reflection led to many experiments and projects during this last decade by external users. Existing work use Reflectivity to implement reflective libraries or languages extensions, featherweight code instrumentation, dynamic software update, debugging tools and visualization and software analysis tools.

Grounding. Reflectivity is actively used in research projects. During the past ten years, it served as a support, either for implementation or as a fundamental base, for many research work including PhD theses, conference, journal and workshop papers. Reflectivity is now an important library of the Pharo language, and is integrated at the heart of the platform.

Importance. Reflectivity exposes powerful abstractions to deal with partial behavioral adaptation, while providing a mature framework for unanticipated, non-intrusive and partial behavioral reflection based on AST annotation.

Furthermore, even if Reflectivity found its home inside Pharo, it is not a pure Smalltalk-oriented solution. As validation over the practical use of Reflectivity in dynamic object-oriented languages, the API has been ported to Python. Finally, the AST annotation feature of Reflectivity opens new experimentation opportunities about the control that developers could gain on the behavior of their own software.","(560, 28)","In this paper, we provide a retrospective look at our use of the sub-method of partial behavioral reflection in conjunction with Reflectivity over the past decade. Our analysis focuses on a variety of aspects, including the practical benefits of the approach, its effectiveness in improving system design, and its potential for future research.

Overall, our experience with this combination of techniques has been highly positive. Through the use of partial behavioral reflection, we have been able to gain valuable insights into the behavior of complex systems, allowing us to identify and address design flaws and other issues that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. Meanwhile, Reflectivity has provided a flexible and powerful foundation for implementing these techniques, allowing us to customize our approach to suit the specific needs of each project.

One particularly notable area of success has been in the realm of software design. Through our use of partial behavioral reflection, we have been able to analyze user interactions with complex software systems, identifying areas of inefficiency, confusion, or error. By using the information gleaned from these analyses, we have been able to improve the design of these systems, resulting in a more intuitive and effective user experience.

However, we also identify areas for improvement in our approach. One significant challenge we have encountered is the difficulty of handling large volumes of data resulting from partial behavioral reflection. Given the sheer amount of information generated by this technique, it can be overwhelming to sort through and make sense of all the data. Similarly, we note that the use of partial behavioral reflection can sometimes result in a lack of context, making it difficult to fully understand the significance of certain observed behaviors.

Despite these limitations, we remain optimistic about the potential for partial behavioral reflection and Reflectivity to continue to drive significant innovation in the field of system design and analysis. Moving forward, we believe that there is room for further optimization of these techniques, as well as for continued exploration of their potential in new and different contexts.

Overall, our experience with partial behavioral reflection and Reflectivity has been highly positive, allowing us to gain important insights into system behavior, improve design, and drive innovation in the field. While challenges remain, we believe that these techniques hold great promise for future research, and we look forward to continuing to explore their potential in the years to come.","(442, 16)","Context. Refining or altering existing behavior is the daily work of every developer, but that
work is often tedious and error-prone. To address this problem, we introduce Reflectivity, a
behavioral reflection system that allows developers to define new behaviors in terms of existing
behaviors. Reflectivity supports sub-methods, which allow developers to define new methods in
terms of existing methods, and partial behavioral reflection (PBR), which allows developers to
define new methods in terms of a subset of the existing method's behavior. In this paper, we
describe Reflectivity's design, implementation, evaluation, and lessons learned from 10 years of
use.
Methodology. We implemented Reflectivity as an extension to the Smalltalk programming
language. We evaluated Reflectivity through a series of case studies and a user study. The case
studies demonstrate how Reflectivity can be used to solve real-world problems, while the user
study evaluates the usability of Reflectivity.
Findings. The case studies show that Reflectivity can significantly reduce the effort required to
refine or alter existing behavior. The user study shows that Reflectivity is easy to learn and use.
Implications. Reflectivity is a powerful tool for developers, allowing them to define new
behaviors in terms of existing behaviors. By reducing the effort required to refine or alter existing
behavior, Reflectivity can help developers to be more productive and less error-prone.","(249, 15)",,

Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) processing of EV 31 magnesium alloy has been carried out in
","Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) processing of EV 31 magnesium alloy has been carried out in fluoride containing electrolyte under bipolar pulse current regime. Unusual PEO cathodic micro-discharges have been observed and investigated. It is shown that the cathodic micro-discharges exhibit a collective intermittent behavior which is discussed in terms of charge accumulations at the layer/electrolyte and layer/metal interfaces. Optical emission spectroscopy is used to determine the electron density (typ. 10 15 cm-3) and the electron temperature (typ. 7500 K) while the role of F-anions on the appearance of cathodic micro-discharges is pointed out. Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) is a promising plasma-assisted surface treatment of light metallic alloys (e.g. Al, Mg, Ti). Although the PEO process makes it possible to grow oxide coatings with interesting corrosion and wear resistant properties, the physical mechanisms of coating growth are not yet completely understood. Typically, the process consists in applying a high voltage difference between a metallic piece and a counter-electrode which are both immersed in an electrolyte bath. Compare to anodizing, the main differences concern the electrolyte composition and the current and voltage ranges which are at least one order of magnitude higher in PEO 1. These significant differences in current and voltage imply the dielectric breakdown and consequently the appearance of micro-discharges on the surface of the sample under processing. Those micro-discharges are recognized as being the main contributors to the formation of a dielectric porous crystalline oxide coating.

2 Nevertheless, the breakdown mechanism that governs the appearance of those micro-discharges is still under investigation. Hussein et al. 3 proposed a mechanism with three different plasma formation processes based on differences in plasma chemical composition. The results of Jovovi{\'c} et al. 4,5 concerning physical properties of the plasma seem to corroborate this mechanism, and also point out the importance of the substrate material in the plasma composition. 6 Compared with DC conducted PEO process, using a bipolar pulsed DC or AC current supply gives supplementary control latitude through the current waveform parameters. The effect of these parameter on the micro-discharges behavior has been investigated in several previous works.

2,3,7,8 One of the main results of these studies is the absence of micro-discharge during the cathodic current half-period. 9-11 Even if the cathodic half-period has an obvious effect on the efficiency of PEO as well as on the coating growth and composition, the micro-plasmas appear only in anodic half-period. Sah et al. 8 have observed the cathodic breakdown of an oxide layer but at very high current density (10 kA.dm-${}^2$), and after several steps of sample preparation. Several models of micro-discharges appearance in AC current have already been proposed. 1,2,8,12,13 Though cathodic micro-discharges have never been observed within usual process conditions, the present study aims at defining suitable conditions to promote cathodic micro-discharges and at studying the main characteristics of these micro-plasmas.","(528, 26)","The plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process has been widely researched for its ability to enhance the corrosion resistance and surface hardness of materials. In this study, we investigate the evidence of cathodic micro-discharges during the PEO process.

To examine the occurrence of micro-discharges, a series of experiments were conducted using aluminum alloy substrates immersed in an electrolyte solution. The samples were subjected to a range of voltage pulses with varying frequencies and durations. The resulting behavior of the discharges was monitored using high-speed imaging and optical emission spectroscopy.

Our findings indicate that cathodic micro-discharges were detected during the PEO process. These discharges occurred on both the surface and within the electrolyte solution. The discharges were characterized by high-intensity flashes lasting between 1 and 10 microseconds, and were accompanied by significant changes in optical emissions.

The observed behavior of the discharges strongly suggests that they play a significant role in the PEO process. It is proposed that these micro-discharges contribute to the structuring and hardening of the oxide layer formed on the surface by enhancing the surface energy and reactivity. Furthermore, the discharges are thought to facilitate the incorporation of foreign particles into the oxide layer, further improving its properties.

To further investigate the nature of these micro-discharges, we conducted numerical simulations using a hybrid model combining fluid dynamics, electrodynamics, and surface chemistry. The model was able to reproduce the observed behavior of the discharges and provided additional insights into their underlying mechanisms.

Overall, our study provides compelling evidence for the presence and significance of cathodic micro-discharges during the PEO process. This knowledge can be applied to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the process for a variety of engineering applications. In future research, it would be interesting to investigate the impact of different parameters, such as voltage and electrolyte composition, on the behavior of these discharges.","(336, 16)","Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) processing of EV 31 magnesium alloy has been carried out in
an alkaline silicate-based electrolyte. The PEO coatings were characterized by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results showed that the PEO coatings were
composed of MgO, Mg2SiO4, and SiO2. The thickness of the PEO coatings was about 20 μm. The
coatings exhibited good corrosion resistance in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. The cathodic microdischarges
during the PEO process were investigated by SEM and EDS. It was found that the cathodic
micro-discharges were caused by the local breakdown of the dielectric layer on the surface of the
substrate. The micro-discharges resulted in the formation of pores and cracks in the PEO coatings.
The cathodic micro-discharges also led to the incorporation of oxygen into the PEO coatings. The
cathodic micro-discharges played an important role in the PEO process and affected the properties of
the PEO coatings.","(186, 10)",,

Developers need to make a constant effort to improve the quality of their code if
","Developers need to make a constant effort to improve the quality of their code if they want to stay productive. Tools that highlight code locations that could benefit from refactoring are thus highly desirable. The most common name for such locations is ""bad code smell"". A number of tools offer such quality feedback and there is a substantial body of related research. However, all these tools, including those based on Machine Learning, still produce false positives. Every single false positive shown to the developer places a cognitive burden on her and should thus be avoided. The literature discusses the choice of metric thresholds, the general subjectivity of such a judgment and the relation to conscious design choices, ""design ideas"". To examine false positives and the relation between bad smells and design ideas, we designed and conducted an exploratory case study. While previous research presented a broad overview, we have chosen a narrow setting to reach for even deeper insights: The framework JHotDraw had been designed so thoughtfully that most smell warnings are expected to be false positives. Nevertheless, the ""Law of Good Style"", better known as the ""Law of Demeter"", is a rather restrictive design rule so that we still expected to find some potential bad smells, i.e.

violations of this ""Law"". This combination led to 1215 potential smells of which at most 42 are true positives. We found generic as well as specific design ideas that were traded for the smell. Our confidence in that decision ranged from high enough to very high. We were surprised to realize that the smell definition itself required the formulation of constructive design ideas.

Finally we found some smells to be the result of the limitation of the language and one could introduce auxiliary constructive design ideas to compensate for them. The decision whether a potential smell occurrence is actually a true positive was made very meticulously. For that purpose we took three qualities that the smell could affect negatively into account and we discussed the result of the recommended refactorings. If we were convinced that we had found a false positive, we described the relationships with design ideas. The realization that not only general design ideas but also specific design ideas have an influence on whether a potential smell is a true positive turns the problem of false positives from a scientific problem (""What is the true definition of the smell?"") to a engineering problem (""How can we incorporate design ideas into smell definitions?""). We recommend to add adaptation points to the smell definitions. Higher layers may then adapt the smell for specific contexts.

After adaptation the tool may continuously provide distinct and precise quality feedback, reducing the cognitive load for the developer and preventing habituation. Furthermore, the schema for the discussion of potential smells may be used to elaborate more sets of true and false smell occurrences. Finally, it follows that smell detection based on machine learning should also take signs of design ideas into account.","(556, 26)","This research paper explores the extent to which JHotDraw, a popular drawing application framework, conforms to the principles of good coding style. We investigate whether instances of reported bad code smells - indicators of poor quality code - are in fact false positives or genuine issues. Our study constitutes a deep dive into the nature of these false positives.

First, we provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant literature, including previous studies and best practices in coding. We then present the methodology used in our investigation, highlighting the criteria for identifying bad code smells and selecting relevant metrics for analysis.

Our results suggest that while JHotDraw generally adheres to good coding practices, there are instances of false positives related to certain types of bad code smells. In particular, we found that code smells related to duplication, complexity, and unused code were more likely to be false positives than others. This finding has important implications for developers who use automated code analysis tools, as false positives can waste time and resources and detract from genuine issues.

Furthermore, we offer insights into the reasons behind these false positives. We find that the use of design patterns and certain coding conventions in JHotDraw can sometimes create false positives for certain bad code smells. These findings are relevant not only for JHotDraw developers but also for other developers who may encounter similar challenges.

Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the broader software development community. We argue that automated code analysis tools need to consider context-specific factors when detecting bad code smells and that developers need to exercise caution when interpreting the results of such tools. Our study highlights the need for continued research into the nature of false positives in automated code analysis and for the development of improved tools and techniques for identifying genuine issues.

In conclusion, our study offers a deep dive into the nature of false positives in bad code smells, providing insights into the specific context of JHotDraw as well as broader implications for software development. Our findings may be of interest to researchers, developers, and quality assurance professionals alike.","(385, 16)","Developers need to make a constant effort to improve the quality of their code if
they want to produce high-quality software. One way to do this is by using code
smells, which are indicators of potential problems in the code. However, not all
code smells are created equal, and some may be more harmful than others. In this
paper, we will explore the concept of code smells and how they can be used to
improve the quality of software. We will also discuss the different types of code
smells and their impact on software quality. Finally, we will provide some
recommendations for developers on how to use code smells to improve the quality
of their code.

The first step in understanding code smells is to define what they are. A code
smell is an indication that there may be a problem with the code, but it does not
necessarily mean that there is a problem. Code smells can be caused by a variety
of factors, such as poor design, lack of testing, or simply bad coding practices.
However, not all code smells are harmful, and some may even be beneficial. For
example, a code smell that indicates a lack of testing may actually be a good
thing, as it encourages developers to test their code more thoroughly.

There are many different types of code smells, and each one can have a different
impact on software quality. Some of the most common code smells include:

- Duplication: This is when the same code is repeated in multiple places in the
  codebase. This can lead to maintenance issues, as changes to the code must be
  made in multiple places.
- Long methods: This is when a method is too long and difficult to read. This can
  make it difficult to understand what the code is doing and can lead to errors.
- Complex conditionals: This is when there are too many conditions in a single
  conditional statement. This can make the code difficult to read and can lead to
  errors.
- Duplicated code: This is similar to duplication, but it occurs when the same
  code is repeated within a single method. This can also lead to maintenance
  issues.

These are just a few examples of code smells, but there are many more. Each type
of code smell has its own unique impact on software quality, and it is important
to understand how each one can affect your code.

One of the most important things to remember when dealing with code smells is
that they are not always harmful. In fact, some code smells can actually be
beneficial. For","(484, 25)",,

In the study of Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles, it is natural to perturb Hamiltoni-ans
","In the study of Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles, it is natural to perturb Hamiltoni-ans by adding potentials (functions depending only on the base point). This led to the definition of Ma{\~n}{\'e} genericity: a property is generic if, given a Hamiltonian H, the set of potentials u such that H + u satisfies the property is generic. This notion is mostly used in the context of Hamiltonians which are convex in p, in the sense that $\partial$ 2 pp H is positive definite at each points. We will also restrict our study to this situation. There is a close relation between perturbations of Hamiltonians by a small additive potential and perturbations by a positive factor close to one.

Indeed, the Hamiltonians H + u and H/(1 -- u) have the same level one energy surface, hence their dynamics on this energy surface are reparametrisation of each other, this is the Maupertuis principle. This remark is particularly relevant when H is homogeneous in the fibers (which corresponds to Finsler metrics) or even fiberwise quadratic (which corresponds to Riemannian metrics).

In these cases, perturbations by potentials of the Hamiltonian correspond, up to parametrisation, to conformal perturbations of the metric. One of the widely studied aspects is to understand to what extent the return map associated to a periodic orbit can be perturbed by adding a small potential. This kind of question depend strongly on the context in which they are posed. Some of the most studied contexts are, in increasing order of difficulty, perturbations of general vector fields, perturbations of Hamiltonian systems inside the class of Hamiltonian systems, perturbations of Riemannian metrics inside the class of Riemannian metrics, Ma{\~n}{\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians. It is for example well-known that each vector field can be perturbed to a vector field with only hyperbolic periodic orbits, this is part of the Kupka-Smale theorem, see [5, 13]. There is no such result in the context of Hamiltonian vector fields, but it remains true that each Hamiltonian can be perturbed to a Hamiltonian with only non-degenerate periodic orbits (including the iterated ones), see [11, 12]. The same result is true in the context of Riemannian metrics: every Riemannian metric can be perturbed to a Riemannian metric with only non-degenerate closed geodesics, this is the bumpy metric theorem, see [4, 2, 1]. The question was investigated only much more recently in the context of Ma{\~n}{\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians, see [9, 10]. It is proved in [10] that the same result holds : If H is a convex Hamiltonian and a is a regular value of H, then there exist arbitrarily small potentials u such that all periodic orbits (including iterated ones) of H + u at energy a are non-degenerate. The proof given in [10] is actually rather similar to the ones given in papers on the perturbations of Riemannian metrics. In all these proofs, it is very useful to work","(584, 18)","This paper investigates the normal form near orbit segments of convex Hamiltonian systems. We introduce the necessary mathematical framework and tools for the study of convex Hamiltonian systems, emphasizing the importance of symplectic geometry and canonical transformations. We then consider the existence of normal forms near orbit segments in these systems.

We provide a rigorous analysis of the normal form in convex Hamiltonian systems and derive conditions for its existence. Specifically, we show that these conditions are related to the convexity of the Hamiltonian and the existence of certain types of periodic orbits. Our results provide insight into the dynamical behavior and geometry of these systems, as well as their applications to physics, engineering, and materials science.

Moreover, we apply our findings to the study of some concrete examples of convex Hamiltonian systems. We investigate the normal form near orbit segments in two-dimensional systems with polynomial Hamiltonians and show how the existence of normal forms is related to the topology of the energy surface. We also study a three-dimensional system with a singular potential and show how the existence of certain types of periodic orbits affects the normal form.

Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of convex Hamiltonian systems and their applications. We show that the normal form near orbit segments provides valuable information about the global dynamics of the system, such as the stability and instability of periodic orbits, the existence of invariant tori, and the topology of the energy surface. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to understand the complex behavior of physical and engineering systems, and provides a useful framework for future research in this area.

In conclusion, this paper presents a systematic study of the normal form near orbit segments of convex Hamiltonian systems. Our main contributions are the mathematical tools and conditions for the existence of normal forms, their application to concrete examples, and their implications for the global dynamics and geometry of these systems.

in such a way that the perturbed Hamiltonian has a normal form near an orbit segment of the
unperturbed Hamiltonian. In this paper, we consider the case where the unperturbed Hamiltonian
is convex and the perturbation is sufficiently small. We show that in this case, the perturbed
Hamiltonian can be put into a normal form near any orbit segment of the unperturbed Hamil-
tonian. Moreover, we show that this normal form is unique up to symplectic diffeomorphisms
of the cotangent bundle. Finally, we discuss some applications of our results to the study of
convex Hamiltonian systems.
To begin, we recall some basic definitions and facts about Hamiltonian systems. A Hamiltonian
system on a symplectic manifold (M, ω) is a pair (H, X), where H : M → R is a smooth function
called the Hamiltonian and X is a vector field on M called the Hamiltonian vector field. The
Hamiltonian vector field is defined by the equation ω(X, Y) = dH(Y) for all vector fields Y on M,
where ω is the symplectic form on M and dH is the differential of H. The flow of the Hamiltonian
vector field is called the Hamiltonian flow. A Hamiltonian system is said to be convex if the
Hamiltonian is strictly convex, i.e., if the Hessian matrix of H with respect to the symplectic
form ω is positive definite at every point of M.
Next, we recall the notion of a normal form for a Hamiltonian system. A normal form for a
Hamiltonian system (H, X) is a diffeomorphism φ : M → M such that φ∗(H) = H + O(ε2), where
ε is a small parameter and O(ε2) denotes terms of order ε2 and higher. In other words, a normal
form is a change of coordinates that puts the Hamiltonian into a simpler form, up to terms of
order ε2 and higher.
Now, we are ready to state our main result. Let (H0, X0) be a convex Hamiltonian system on
the cotangent bundle T∗M, where M is a compact manifold. Let (H1, X1) be a perturbation of
(H0, X0), i.e., a Hamiltonian system on T∗M such that H1 − H0 = O","(440, 14)",,

Coalition formation is a fundamental type of interaction that involves the creation of coherent groupings
","Coalition formation is a fundamental type of interaction that involves the creation of coherent groupings of distinct, autonomous, agents in order to efficiently achieve their individual or collective goals. Forming effective coalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems.

Central to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many possible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually requires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the coalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it was formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a combination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one coalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized.

However, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging due to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows exponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques ranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search all of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution quality, and memory requirements.

With this in mind, we develop an anytime algorithm to solve the coalition structure generation problem. Specifically, the algorithm uses a novel representation of the search space, which partitions the space of possible solutions into sub-spaces such that it is possible to compute upper and lower bounds on the values of the best coalition structures in them. These bounds are then used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the optimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches through the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound technique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s).

In this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition structures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions automatically. Moreover, in order to effectively test our algorithm we develop a new type of input distribution which allows us to generate more reliable benchmarks compared to the input distributions previously used in the field.

Given this new distribution, we show that for 27 agents our algorithm is able to find solutions that are optimal in 0.175% of the time required by the fastest available algorithm in the literature. The algorithm is anytime, and if interrupted before it would have normally terminated, it can still provide a solution that is guaranteed to be within a bound from the optimal one.

Moreover, the guarantees we provide on the quality of the solution are significantly better than those provided by the previous state of the art algorithms designed for this purpose. For example, for the worst case distribution given 25 agents, our algorithm is able to find a 90% efficient solution in around 10% of time it takes to find the optimal solution.","(535, 17)","Coalition formation is a well-established field of research in artificial intelligence, economics, and social choice theory, among others. Its main goal is to investigate how groups of agents can join forces to achieve specific goals and how this cooperation can be sustained over time. One of the fundamental problems in coalition formation is optimal coalition structure generation, which aims to find the best possible way to partition a group of agents into coalitions that maximize a given objective function.

In this paper, we propose an anytime algorithm for optimal coalition structure generation that can be used in a wide range of contexts, from multi-agent systems to political science and organizational management. Our approach is based on a novel combination of search algorithms and decision-theoretic reasoning that allows us to generate high-quality coalition structures with minimal computational overhead.

The key idea behind our algorithm is to iteratively improve an initial coalition structure by exploring neighboring structures that satisfy certain optimality conditions. At each iteration, we use decision-theoretic techniques to evaluate the quality of the current coalition structure and decide whether to continue the search or return the best found result so far. This approach gives us the flexibility to trade-off between the quality of the solution and the time and resources available, making our algorithm ideal for applications with varying time and resource constraints.

We evaluate our algorithm on a set of benchmark instances and compare its performance against state-of-the-art algorithms for coalition structure generation. Our experiments show that our anytime algorithm is highly competitive and outperforms existing approaches in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm scales well to large instances, making it a practical tool for real-world applications.

In conclusion, this paper presents a new anytime algorithm for optimal coalition structure generation that combines search algorithms and decision-theoretic reasoning for high-quality and efficient coalition formation. Our approach is flexible and can be used in a wide range of contexts, from multi-agent systems to political science and organizational management. Our empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm is highly competitive and outperforms existing approaches, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners alike.","(387, 14)","Coalition formation is a fundamental type of interaction that involves the creation of coherent groupings

","The paper deals with the automatic analysis of real-life telephone conversations between an agent and a customer of a customer care service (ccs).

The application domain is the public transportation system in Paris and the purpose is to collect statistics about customer problems in order to monitor the service and decide priorities on the intervention for improving user satisfaction. Of primary importance for the analysis is the detection of themes that are the object of customer problems. Themes are defined in the application requirements and are part of the application ontology that is implicit in the ccs documentation. Due to variety of customer population, the structure of conversations with an agent is unpredictable. A conversation may be about one or more themes. Theme mentions can be interleaved with mentions of facts that are irrelevant for the application purpose. Furthermore, in certain conversations theme mentions are localized in specific conversation segments while in other conversations mentions cannot be localized. As a consequence, approaches to feature extraction with and without mention localization are considered. Application domain relevant themes identified by an automatic procedure are expressed by specific sentences whose words are hypothesized by an automatic speech recognition (asr) system. The asr system is error prone.

The word error rates can be very high for many reasons. Among them it is worth mentioning unpredictable background noise, speaker accent, and various types of speech disfluencies. As the application task requires the composition of proportions of theme mentions, a sequential decision strategy is introduced in this paper for performing a survey of the large amount of conversations made available in a given time period. The strategy has to sample the conversations to form a survey containing enough data analyzed with high accuracy so that proportions can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Due to the unpredictable type of theme mentions, it is appropriate to consider methods for theme hypothesization based on global as well as local feature extraction. Two systems based on each type of feature extraction will be considered by the strategy. One of the four methods is novel. It is based on a new definition of density of theme mentions and on the localization of high density zones whose boundaries do not need to be precisely detected. The sequential decision strategy starts by grouping theme hypotheses into sets of different expected accuracy and coverage levels. For those sets for which accuracy can be improved with a consequent increase of coverage a new system with new features is introduced. Its execution is triggered only when specific preconditions are met on the hypotheses generated by the basic four systems. Experimental results are provided on a corpus collected in the call center of the Paris transportation system known as ratp. The results show that surveys with high accuracy and coverage can be composed with the proposed strategy and systems. This makes it possible to apply a previously published proportion estimation approach that takes into account hypothesization errors .","(527, 25)","This paper discusses the identification of multiple topics in human-to-human conversations, a task which is crucial for effective communication and natural language processing. The ability to accurately identify topics in conversations has many applications such as information retrieval, summarization, and sentiment analysis. We begin by reviewing the relevant literature on topic identification and summarize the state-of-the-art techniques for topic modeling. We then introduce a new method based on statistical natural language processing that is designed to improve the accuracy of topic identification in both structured and unstructured conversations. Our approach uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as support vector machines, clustering, and latent semantic analysis to effectively identify multiple topics in conversation. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments on several different datasets. Our results show that our model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on all of the datasets we tested. We also investigate the effects of different conversation characteristics such as topic distribution, conversation length, and topic correlation on topic identification accuracy. 

Finally, we discuss several potential applications of our model in real-world conversational settings. For example, our method could be used to identify key topics in social media discussions or email threads in order to facilitate information retrieval. Our model could also be used to summarize conversations or identify sentiment and emotional tone in conversations. 

In conclusion, we present an effective approach for multiple topic identification in human-to-human conversations using machine learning techniques. Our method outperforms existing techniques and has several potential applications in conversational settings.","(280, 13)","The paper deals with the automatic analysis of real-life telephone conversations between an agent and

The pair-condensed unpolarized spin-$1/2$ Fermi gases have a collective excitation branch in their pair-breaking continuum
","The pair-condensed unpolarized spin-$1/2$ Fermi gases have a collective excitation branch in their pair-breaking continuum (V.A. Andrianov, V.N. Popov, 1976). We study it at zero temperature, with the eigenenergy equation deduced from the linearized time-dependent BCS theory and extended analytically to the lower half complex plane through its branch cut, calculating both the dispersion relation and the spectral weights (quasiparticle residues) of the branch. In the case of BCS superconductors, so called because the effect of the ion lattice is replaced by a short-range electron-electron interaction, we also include the Coulomb interaction and we restrict ourselves to the weak coupling limit $\Delta/\mu\to 0^+$ ($\Delta$ is the order parameter, $\mu $ the chemical potential) and to wavenumbers $q=O(1/\xi)$ where $\xi$ is the size of a pair; when the complex energy $z_q$ is expressed in units of $\Delta$ and $q$ in units of $1/\xi$, the branch follows a universal law insensitive to the Coulomb interaction. In the case of cold atoms in the BEC-BCS crossover, only a contact interaction remains, but the coupling strength $\Delta/\mu$ can take arbitrary values, and we study the branch at any wave number. At weak coupling, we predict three scales, that already mentioned $q\approx 1/\xi$, that $q\approx(\Delta/\mu)^{-1/3}/\xi$ where the real part of the dispersion relation has a minimum and that $q\approx (\mu/\Delta)/\xi\approx k_{\rm F}$ ($k_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave number) where the branch reaches the edge of its existence domain. Near the point where the chemical potential vanishes on the BCS side, $\mu/\Delta\to 0^+$, where $\xi\approx k_{\rm F}$, we find two scales $q\approx(\mu/\Delta)^{1/2}/\xi$ and $q\approx 1/\xi$. In all cases, the branch has a limit $2\Delta$ and a quadratic start at $q=0$. These results were obtained for $\mu>0$, where the eigenenergy equation admits at least two branch points $\epsilon_a(q)$ and $\epsilon_b(q)$ on the positive real axis, and for an analytic continuation through the interval $[\epsilon_a(q),\epsilon_b(q)] $.

We find new continuum branches by performing the analytic continuation through $[\epsilon_b(q),+\infty[$ or even, for $q$ low enough, where there is a third real positive branch point $\epsilon_c(q)$, through $[\epsilon_b(q),\epsilon_c(q)]$ and $[\epsilon_c(q),+\infty[$. On the BEC side $\mu<0$ not previously studied, where there is only one real positive branch point $ \epsilon_a(q)$, we also find new collective excitation branches under the branch cut $[\epsilon_a (q),+\infty[$. For $\mu>0$, some of these new branches have a low-wavenumber exotic hypoacoustic $z_q\approx q^{3/2}$ or hyperacoustic $z_q\approx q^{4/5}$ behavior. For $\mu<0$, we find a hyperacoustic branch and a nonhypoacoustic branch, with a limit $2\Delta$ and a purely real quadratic start at $q=0$ for $\Delta/|\mu|<0.222$.","(645, 14)","The collective excitations in the continuum of pair-condensed Fermi gases have been studied analytically, and scaling laws for these excitations have been derived. This study focuses on the properties and behaviors of these collective excitations, particularly in the low-temperature regime. The analytical study utilizes the finite-temperature Green’s function technique along with the random-phase approximation, providing a theoretical framework for the scaling laws derived. The scaling laws reveal the existence of a characteristic frequency proportional to the square root of the gas’s coupling strength, which scales as a function of density. The analytical treatment of this problem enables us to investigate the properties of the collective excitation branch, such as its spectral weight, lifetime, and damping, and how they vary as a function of temperature and gas parameters. The analytical results obtained in this study have been validated through comparison with earlier works and provide new insights into the collective dynamics of highly correlated Fermi gases, broadening our understanding of their exotic behavior. The derived scaling laws can be used to predict the behavior of these systems under different conditions and parameter regimes, including the quantum critical regime. These results are particularly interesting in the context of ongoing experiments on strongly correlated Fermi gases, where the collective dynamics of these systems remain an unresolved question. The conclusions drawn from this study provide essential information for the design and interpretation of future experiments on highly correlated Fermi gases. Ultimately, this work contributes to a better understanding of the collective properties of Fermi gases and lays the foundation for future studies investigating the exotic behavior of these systems.","(291, 10)","The pair-condensed unpolarized spin-$1/2$ Fermi gases have a collective excitation branch in their pair-breaking continuum

The scaling law is derived using a variational approach and is shown to be consistent with numerical results.

We show how to transform any set of prioritized propositional defaults into an equivalent set
","We show how to transform any set of prioritized propositional defaults into an equivalent set of parallel (i.e., unprioritized) defaults, in circumscription. We give an algorithm to implement the transform. We show how to use the transform algorithm as a generator of a whole family of inferencing algorithms for circumscription. The method is to employ the transform algorithm as a front end to any inferencing algorithm, e.g., one of the previously available, that handles the parallel (empty) case of prioritization. Our algorithms provide not just coverage of a new expressive class, but also alternatives to previous algorithms for implementing the previously covered class (?layered?) of prioritization. In particular, we give a new query-answering algorithm for prioritized cirumscription which is sound and complete for the full expressive class of unrestricted finite prioritization partial orders, for propositional defaults (or minimized predicates). By contrast, previous algorithms required that the prioritization partial order be layered, i.e., structured similar to the system of rank in the military. Our algorithm enables, for the first time, the implementation of the most useful class of prioritization: non-layered prioritization partial orders. Default inheritance, for example, typically requires non-layered prioritization to represent specificity adequately. Our algorithm enables not only the implementation of default inheritance (and specificity) within prioritized circumscription, but also the extension and combination of default inheritance with other kinds of prioritized default reasoning, e.g.: with stratified logic programs with negation-as-failure. Such logic programs are previously known to be representable equivalently as layered-priority predicate circumscriptions.

Worst-case, the transform increases the number of defaults exponentially. We discuss how inferencing is practically implementable nevertheless in two kinds of situations: general expressiveness but small numbers of defaults, or expressive special cases with larger numbers of defaults. One such expressive special case is non-?top-heaviness? of the prioritization partial order. In addition to its direct implementation, the transform can also be exploited analytically to generate special case algorithms, e.g., a tractable transform for a class within default inheritance (detailed in another, forthcoming paper). We discuss other aspects of the significance of the fundamental result.

One can view the transform as reducing n degrees of partially ordered belief confidence to just 2 degrees of confidence: for-sure and (unprioritized) default. Ordinary, parallel default reasoning, e.g., in parallel circumscription or Poole's Theorist, can be viewed in these terms as reducing 2 degrees of confidence to just 1 degree of confidence: that of the non-monotonic theory's conclusions. The expressive reduction's computational complexity suggests that prioritization is valuable for its expressive conciseness, just as defaults are for theirs. For Reiter's Default Logic and Poole's Theorist, the transform implies how to extend those formalisms so as to equip them with a concept of prioritization that is exactly equivalent to that in circumscription. This provides an interesting alternative to Brewka's approach to equipping them with prioritization-type precedence.","(547, 24)","Abstract:

The process of default reasoning has been widely studied in artificial intelligence and logic. Defaults play a key role in handling incomplete information and making assumptions about the world. However, prioritized defaults and specificity can lead to conflicts and inconsistencies when used in parallel systems. In this paper, we propose a new approach that transforms prioritized defaults and specificity into parallel defaults, which can be used to overcome these issues.

Our approach involves representing defaults as sets of parallel rules, each with their own level of specificity. These parallel defaults can be evaluated simultaneously, allowing for more efficient and consistent reasoning. We also introduce a method for resolving conflicts between parallel defaults using a priority ranking scheme. This scheme assigns priorities to different defaults based on their specificity and allows for the selection of a single default when conflicts arise.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several experiments, including benchmark problems and real-world examples. Our results show that the use of parallel defaults can lead to more accurate and efficient reasoning, particularly in cases with conflicting defaults. Furthermore, our approach is scalable and can be extended to handle more complex default reasoning problems.

Overall, our work presents a novel approach for transforming prioritized defaults and specificity into parallel defaults, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of default reasoning in artificial intelligence and logic. Our approach also provides a framework for resolving conflicts between defaults and can be adapted to handle a wide range of default reasoning problems.","(275, 13)","We show how to transform any set of prioritized propositional defaults into an equivalent set
of parallel defaults. We also show how to transform a set of specificity defaults into an
equivalent set of parallel defaults. In both cases, the resulting set of parallel defaults has
exactly the same extensions as the original set of prioritized or specificity defaults. These
transformations are useful because they allow us to reason about prioritized and specificity
defaults in terms of parallel defaults, which are easier to understand and work with than
prioritized or specificity defaults. Additionally, these transformations can be used to prove
properties of prioritized and specificity defaults by reducing them to properties of parallel
defaults. Finally, we show how to use these transformations to derive new results about
prioritized and specificity defaults.","(141, 6)",,

","Context: The algorithms for generating a safe fluent API are actively studied these years. A safe fluent API is the fluent API that reports incorrect chaining of the API methods as a type error to the API users. Although such a safe property improves the productivity of its users, the construction of a safe fluent API is too complicated for the developers. The generation algorithms are studied to reduce the development cost of a safe fluent API. The study on the generation would benefit a number of programmers since a fluent API is a popular design in the real world.

Inquiry: The generation of a generic fluent API has been left untackled. A generic fluent API refers to the fluent API that provides generic methods (methods that contain type parameters in their definitions). The Stream API in Java is an example of such a generic API. The recent research on the safe fluent API generation rather focuses on the grammar class that the algorithm can deal with for syntax checking. The key idea of the previous study is to use nested generics to represent a stack structure for the parser built on top of the type system. In that idea, the role of a type parameter was limited to internally representing a stack element of that parser on the type system. The library developers could not use type parameters to include a generic method in their API so that the semantic constraints for their API would be statically checked, for example, the type constraint on the items passed through a stream.

Approach: We propose an algorithm to generate a generic fluent API. Our translation algorithm is modeled as the construction of deterministic finite automaton (DFA) with type parameter information. Each state of the DFA holds information about which type parameters are already bound in that state. This information is used to identify whether a method invocation in a chain newly binds a type to a type parameter, or refers to a previously bound type. The identification is required since a type parameter in a chain is bound at a particular method invocation, and that bound type is referred to in the following method invocations. Our algorithm constructs the DFA by analyzing the binding time of type parameters and their propagation among the states in a DFA that is naively constructed from the given grammar.

Knowledge and Importance: Our algorithm helps library developers to develop a generic fluent API. The ability to generate a generic fluent API is essential to bring the safe fluent API generation to the real world since the use of type parameters is a common technique in the library API design. By our algorithm, the generation of a safe fluent API will be ready for practical use.

Grounding: We implemented a generator named Protocool to demonstrate our algorithm. We also generated several libraries using Protocool to show the ability and the limitations of our algorithm.","(527, 23)","In the world of software development, application programming interfaces (APIs) are essential for working with libraries and frameworks. They allow developers to access pre-written code and build upon it to create new applications. A fluent API is a type of API that is designed to be easy to read and write, providing more natural language-like syntax that feels like a domain-specific language (DSL). This paper presents a methodology for generating a generic fluent API in Java.

The proposed methodology involves the use of code generation and automated testing. The process starts with the identification of a domain-specific language that will be used to generate the fluent API. This DSL is then used to generate the code for the API using a code generation tool. The generated code is tested using a suite of automated tests to ensure that it is correct and meets the desired specifications.

The benefits of using a fluent API in Java are substantial. The more natural language-like syntax reduces the cognitive overhead of learning new APIs and makes code more readable. In addition, the fluent API makes it easier to create complex chains of operations, reducing the amount of boilerplate code that would be necessary with a traditional API.

The generic nature of the proposed fluent API means that it can be used in a wide variety of applications. By defining a domain-specific language, developers can tailor the API to the specific needs of their application while still benefiting from the simplified syntax of a fluent API.

To validate the effectiveness of the methodology, we conducted a case study in which we created a fluent API for a sample application. The results of the case study showed that the generated code was correct and met the desired specifications. In addition, the resulting code was easier to read and write than a traditional API.

In conclusion, the proposed methodology for generating a generic fluent API in Java provides a powerful tool for developers to create more readable and maintainable code. The use of code generation and automated testing ensures that the resulting API is correct and meets the desired specifications. The generic nature of the proposed API makes it useful in a wide variety of applications and provides a more natural language-like syntax that reduces cognitive overhead.","(411, 19)","Context: The algorithms for generating a safe fluent API are actively studied these years. A
fluent API is an application programming interface (API) that allows the programmer to write
expressive code by using a ""fluent"" style. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for
generating a generic fluent API in Java. Our algorithm is based on the idea of type inference,
which is a technique for inferring the types of variables and expressions in a program. We show
that our algorithm can generate a generic fluent API that is both safe and expressive. We also
show that our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of both safety and
expressiveness. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work for the design of safe and
expressive fluent APIs in Java.
Research Question/Problem: How can we generate a safe and expressive fluent API in Java?
Methodology: We propose an algorithm for generating a generic fluent API based on type
inference. Our algorithm takes as input a set of Java classes and methods, and it outputs a set of
Java classes and methods that implement the fluent API. The algorithm works by first inferring
the types of the variables and expressions in the input classes and methods. It then uses these
types to generate the classes and methods of the fluent API.
Findings: We evaluated our algorithm on a set of benchmarks, and we found that it outperforms
existing algorithms in terms of safety and expressiveness. Our algorithm was able to generate
safe and expressive fluent APIs for all of the benchmarks, while the existing algorithms were
unable to generate safe fluent APIs for some of the benchmarks.
Implications: Our work has several implications for the design of fluent APIs in Java. First, it
shows that type inference can be used to generate safe and expressive fluent APIs. Second, it
suggests that existing algorithms for generating fluent APIs may need to be improved in order to
generate safe fluent APIs. Finally, it raises the question of whether there are other techniques
that can be used to improve the safety and expressiveness of fluent APIs.","(387, 18)",,

We use the notion of quasimultiplier, introduced in 1981 by the author at the Long Beach Conference on Banach algebras: the generators of the semigroups under consideration will be defined as quasimultipliers on A, and for $\zeta$ in the Arveson resolvent set $\sigma$ar($\Delta$T) the resolvent ($\Delta$T -- $\zeta$I) --1 will be defined as a regular quasimultiplier on A, i.e. a quasimultiplier S on A such that sup n$\ge$1 $\lambda$ n S n u < +$\infty$ for some $\lambda$ > 0 and some u generating a dense ideal of A and belonging to the intersection of the domains of S n , n $\ge$ 1.

The paper begins with an overview of functional calculus for operators and its applications. A variety of examples are explored to demonstrate the usefulness and versatility of the concept. In particular, it is shown that many important properties of operators can be simplified by using functional calculus.

The main focus of the paper is the development of a holomorphic functional calculus for finite families of commuting semigroups.

As a result, it is possible to define a unique calculus for these objects in a natural way.

This article deals with the design of saturated controls in the context of partial differential
","This article deals with the design of saturated controls in the context of partial differential equations. It focuses on a Korteweg-de Vries equation, which is a nonlinear mathematical model of waves on shallow water surfaces. Two different types of saturated controls are considered. The well-posedness is proven applying a Banach fixed point theorem, using some estimates of this equation and some properties of the saturation function. The proof of the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is separated in two cases: i) when the control acts on all the domain, a Lyapunov function together with a sector condition describing the saturating input is used to conclude on the stability, ii) when the control is localized, we argue by contradiction. Some numerical simulations illustrate the stability of the closed-loop nonlinear partial differential equation. 1. Introduction. In recent decades, a great effort has been made to take into account input saturations in control designs (see e.g [39], [15] or more recently [17]). In most applications, actuators are limited due to some physical constraints and the control input has to be bounded. Neglecting the amplitude actuator limitation can be source of undesirable and catastrophic behaviors for the closed-loop system. The standard method to analyze the stability with such nonlinear controls follows a two steps design. First the design is carried out without taking into account the saturation. In a second step, a nonlinear analysis of the closed-loop system is made when adding the saturation. In this way, we often get local stabilization results. Tackling this particular nonlinearity in the case of finite dimensional systems is already a difficult problem. However, nowadays, numerous techniques are available (see e.g. [39, 41, 37]) and such systems can be analyzed with an appropriate Lyapunov function and a sector condition of the saturation map, as introduced in [39]. In the literature, there are few papers studying this topic in the infinite dimensional case. Among them, we can cite [18], [29], where a wave equation equipped with a saturated distributed actuator is studied, and [12], where a coupled PDE/ODE system modeling a switched power converter with a transmission line is considered. Due to some restrictions on the system, a saturated feedback has to be designed in the latter paper. There exist also some papers using the nonlinear semigroup theory and focusing on abstract systems ([20],[34],[36]). Let us note that in [36], [34] and [20], the study of a priori bounded controller is tackled using abstract nonlinear theory. To be more specific, for bounded ([36],[34]) and unbounded ([34]) control operators, some conditions are derived to deduce, from the asymptotic stability of an infinite-dimensional linear system in abstract form, the asymptotic stability when closing the loop with saturating controller. These articles use the nonlinear semigroup theory (see e.g. [24] or [1]). The Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV for short)","(582, 27)","This paper addresses the problem of global stabilization of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation by means of a saturating distributed control mechanism. KdV is a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) which describes the propagation of weakly nonlinear, dispersive waves in certain physical contexts. It is an important model for various physical phenomena, such as the behavior of shallow water waves in a canal. However, the KdV equation is known to be ill-posed in the sense that small perturbations can grow exponentially in time.

In order to overcome this issue, researchers have developed various control and feedback strategies for the KdV equation. In particular, distributed control mechanisms have proven to be effective in stabilizing the system. This paper presents a new approach to distributed control of the KdV equation, using a saturating control law.

The proposed control law is defined as a function of the solution to the KdV equation itself, as well as its spatial derivative. This allows for a distributed control mechanism which depends only on local information about the system. The control law is also designed to saturate for large values of the solution, ensuring that the control effort is limited in magnitude.

The main result of the paper is the proof of global exponential stability of the closed-loop system, i.e., the stabilized KdV equation with the proposed control law. This means that any solution to the KdV equation subjected to the saturating distributed control law will converge exponentially fast to a unique equilibrium. The proof of this result relies on Lyapunov functional techniques and exhibits a decay rate for the convergence.

Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. The simulations show that the closed-loop system behaves consistently with the theoretical results, even in the presence of external disturbances. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential applications of the proposed control strategy in practical settings.

In summary, this paper presents a new approach to the problem of global stabilization of the KdV equation using a saturating distributed control law. The proposed control mechanism is effective in stabilizing the system and ensuring its global exponential stability. The paper provides theoretical results and numerical simulations to support and validate the proposed approach.","(405, 19)","This article deals with the design of saturated controls in the context of partial differential
equations (PDEs). In particular, it focuses on the global stabilization of the Korteweg–de
Vries (KdV) equation. The KdV equation is a nonlinear PDE that describes the propagation of
waves in various physical systems, such as shallow water waves, plasma waves, and elastic
waves. It has been widely studied in the literature due to its rich mathematical structure and
its applications in many areas of science and engineering.
The main objective of this article is to develop a control strategy for the KdV equation that
ensures global stability of the system. Global stability refers to the ability of the system to
return to a stable equilibrium state after being perturbed from it. In the context of the KdV
equation, global stability means that the solution of the equation converges to a constant
value as time goes to infinity, regardless of the initial conditions.
To achieve this goal, the authors propose a control strategy based on the use of saturated
controls. A saturated control is a control law that limits the magnitude of the control input to
a certain value. This is done to prevent the control input from becoming too large, which can
lead to instability or other undesirable effects. The authors show that by using a properly
designed saturated control, it is possible to achieve global stability for a wide range of initial
conditions and parameter values.
The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, the authors provide a brief introduction to
the KdV equation and its properties. In Section 3, they introduce the concept of saturated
controls and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In Section 4, they present the main
results of the article, including the design of the saturated control and the proof of global
stability. In Section 5, they provide some numerical simulations to illustrate the effectiveness
of the proposed control strategy. Finally, in Section 6, they conclude the article and discuss
some future directions for research.
Overall, this article makes a significant contribution to the field of control theory for PDEs.
It provides a novel approach to the problem of global stabilization of the highly nonlinear
KdV equation, and it demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy through
numerical simulations. The article is well-written and easy to follow, and it will be of interest
to researchers in the fields of control theory, nonlinear dynamics, and applied mathematics.","(453, 20)",,

","Multiparty session types (MST) are a well-established type theory that describes the interactive structure of a fixed number of components from a global point of view and type-checks the components through projection of the global type onto the participants of the session. They guarantee communicationsafety for a language of multiparty sessions (LMS), i.e., distributed, parallel components can exchange values without deadlocking and unexpected message types. Several variants of MST and LMS have been proposed to study key features of distributed and parallel programming. We observe that the population of the considered variants follows from only one ancestor, i.e., the original LMS/MST, and there are overlapping traits between features of the considered variants and the original. These hamper evolution of session types and languages and their adoption in practice. This paper addresses the following question: What are the essential features for MST and LMS, and how can these be modelled with simple constructs? To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this question has been addressed. We performed a systematic analysis of the features and the constructs in MST, LMS, and the considered variants to identify the essential features. The variants are among the most influential (according to Google Scholar) and well-established systems that cover a wide set of areas in distributed, parallel programming. We used classical techniques of formal models such as BNF, structural congruence, small step operational semantics and typing judgments to build our language and type system. Lastly, the coherence of operational semantics and type system is proven by induction. This paper proposes a set of essential features, a language of structured interactions and a type theory of comprehensive multiparty session types, including global types and type system. The analysis removes overlapping features and captures the shared traits, thereby introducing the essential features. The constructs of the language are simple and fundamental, based on the $\lambda$ and $\pi$ calculi. Analogously, our global types reflect what is omitted and introduced in the language. Our system covers all the features of the original and variants, with a better ratio of the number of language and type constructs over the number of covered features.

The features of the original, variants, and our system along with the number of constructs in the respective language and global types to model them are presented through a table. The syntax, operational semantics, meta-theory and type system of our system are given. We modelled all the motivating examples of the variants in our model, describing the reduction and typing steps. The work discusses how new features, in particular the non-essential ones (formerly excluded) and advanced ones can be either modelled atop the essential ones or added with minimal efforts, i.e. without modifying the existing ones. The fundamental properties of typed processes such as subject reduction, communication safety, and progress are established.","(532, 22)","Multiparty session types are a powerful tool for specifying communication protocols in distributed systems, ensuring that processes interact in a coordinated way, and preventing deadlocks and other types of errors. However, existing approaches to multiparty session types have limitations that restrict their applicability in various settings.

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multiparty session types that overcomes many of these limitations. Specifically, it introduces a new syntax for specifying session types that supports complex interactions involving multiple parties, nested sessions, and recursive protocols. The syntax also facilitates the integration of session types with programming languages and software tools, making it easier to develop and verify correct implementations of session-based protocols.

In addition to the new syntax, this framework also includes a type system for statically verifying the correctness of multiparty communications. The type system captures various properties of session types, such as the order and type of messages exchanged between parties, and ensures that these properties are preserved throughout the communication session. The type system can detect many errors at compile-time, preventing many types of runtime errors that may occur in improperly specified communication protocols.

To illustrate the usefulness of this framework, we apply it to several case studies, including a distributed auction system, a chat room, and a network protocol for distributed database systems. These case studies demonstrate the flexibility and generality of the framework, as well as its ability to catch errors and enforce correct behavior in complex, real-world systems.

Overall, this paper offers a comprehensive and powerful tool for specifying multiparty communication protocols in distributed systems. Its new syntax and type system provide a flexible, integrated approach to session types that can improve the correctness and reliability of communication protocols in a variety of domains. This work represents an important step towards making distributed systems more manageable, robust, and secure.","(338, 13)","Multiparty session types (MST) are a well-established type theory that describes the interactive structure of

","We argue about the (non) existence of {\it superregular} scalar clouds (i.e., bound states of a massive and complex-valued scalar field $\Psi$) around exact {\it extremal} ($a = M$) Kerr black holes (BH's) possessing {\it bounded radial derivatives at the horizon} (in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates) as opposed to similar cloud solutions that exist but with unbounded derivatives in the same coordinate system. The latter solutions have been reported recently both analytically and numerically. The superregular clouds cannot be obtained from the regular clouds around subextremal Kerr BH's ($|a|< M$) in the limit of extremality $(a\rightarrow M)$ as in this limit the radial derivatives of $\Psi$ at the horizon $r_H$ diverge when $r_H\rightarrow r_H^{\rm ext}:=M=a$, thus, such superregular clouds must be analyzed separately. We conclude that the superregular clouds, which are found in the {\it exact} extremal scenario ($a = M$), are not continuously connected with the regular ones in the limit of extremality $(a\rightarrow M)$. Remarkably, the spectrum leading to the existence of the radial part of the full solution of these superregular clouds (which obeys a Teukolsky equation) is given by the exact formula $M=a=\frac{1}{2\mu}\sqrt{m^2 + \left[-\kappa+\sqrt{\kappa^2+m^2}\,\right]^2}$, which depends on three (positive) integers: the principal number $n$, the {\it magnetic number} $m$, and an integer $j$, related with the {\it type} of regularity at the horizon. Here $\kappa= j +n$, and $\mu$ is the mass associated with $\Psi$. This spectrum depends implicitly on the {\it orbital} number $l$, an integer number that determines the existence of well behaved spheroidal harmonics which are associated with the angular part of the cloud solution. Since the separation constants that are obtained from the superregularity conditions in the radial part of the solution do {\it not} coincide in general with the standard separation constants required for the spheroidal harmonics to be well behaved on the axis of symmetry, we conclude that non-trivial boson clouds having such superregularity conditions cannot exist in the background of an exact extremal Kerr BH. The only exception to this conclusion is in the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $m\ll n$. In such a large $n$ limit consistency in the separation constants leads to a quadratic Diophantine equation of Pell's type for the integer numbers $(l,m)$. Such Pell's equation can be readily solved using standard techniques. In that instance well behaved spheroidal harmonics are obtained, and thus, well behaved non-trivial superregular clouds can be computed. Of course, this situation, does not preclude the existence of other kind of smooth cloud solutions for any other $n$, not necessarily large (e.g. clouds with a non-integer $\kappa$) when using a better behaved coordinate system at the horizon (e.g. Wheeler's tortoise coordinate or proper radial distance).","(600, 15)","This paper presents a study on the existence and non-existence of superregular boson clouds around extremal Kerr black holes, and its connection with number theory. The research is motivated by the recent advances in the understanding of the properties of black holes, which have revealed a rich interplay between geometry, topology, and quantum physics.

We first define the notion of superregular boson clouds and their relevance to black hole physics. We then investigate the conditions under which such clouds can exist or not exist around extremal Kerr black holes, and analyze their implications for the structure and dynamics of the black hole.

Our analysis is based on a combination of numerical simulations and analytical methods, which allow us to explore the intricate interplay between the geometry of the black hole and the quantum properties of these cloud configurations. We show that there is a close connection between the existence of superregular boson clouds and the properties of certain number-theoretic functions, which play a fundamental role in the study of the geometry of black holes.

We also investigate the physical properties of these cloud configurations, such as their energy, angular momentum, and entropy, and discuss their relevance for the understanding of the thermodynamics and information content of black holes.

Our results have implications for the broader theoretical framework of physics, including quantum field theory, general relativity, and number theory. They provide new insights into the intricate connections between geometry, topology, and quantum physics, and point to new directions for future research in these areas.

Boiling crisis is the rapid formation of the quasi-continuous vapor film between the heater and
","Boiling crisis is the rapid formation of the quasi-continuous vapor film between the heater and the liquid when the heat supply exceeds a critical value. We propose a mechanism for the boiling crisis that is based on the spreading of the dry spot under a vapor bubble. The spreading is initiated by the vapor recoil force, a force coming from the liquid evaporation into the bubble. Since the evaporation intensity increases sharply near the triple contact line, the influence of the vapor recoil can be described as a change of the apparent contact angle. Therefore, for the most usual case of complete wetting of the heating surface by the liquid, the boiling crisis can be understood as a drying transition from complete to partial wetting. The state of nucleate boiling, which is boiling in its usual sense, is characterized by a very large rate of heat transfer from the heating surface to the bulk because the superheated liquid is carried away from the heating surface by the departing vapor bubbles. If the heating power is increased, the temperature of the heating surface increases with the heat flux. When the heat flux from the heater reaches a threshold value q CHF (the critical heat flux, CHF), the vapor bubbles suddenly form a film which covers the heating surface and insulates the latter from the bulk of the liquid. The temperature of the heating surface grows so rapidly that the heater can fuse unless its power is controlled. This phenomenon is known under the names of ""boiling crisis,"" ""burnout,"" or ""Departure from Nucleate Boiling"" (DNB) [1]. The final state of this transition is called film boiling. This problem has become very important since the 1940's, with the beginning of the industrial exploitation of heat exchangers with large heat fluxes (as with nuclear power stations). Since then a huge amount of research has been done for the various conditions of pool boiling (boiling without imposed external flow) and flow boiling (boiling of the flowing water) [2]. Numerous empirical correlations have been proposed, each describing the dependence of the CHF on the physical parameters of the liquid and of the heater more or less correctly for a particular geometry and particular conditions of boiling [2]. A strong dependence of the threshold on the details of the experimental setup coupled with difficulties in separating the consequences of DNB from its causes is at the origin of a large number of frequently controversial hypotheses [2]. The violence of boiling makes observations quite difficult. Good quality photographic experiments are presented in only a few articles (see e.g. [3] -- [6]). Despite an increasing interest in the physical aspect of the problem during recent years [7,8] and numerous empirical approaches, the underlying physics still remains obscure. In this Letter, we propose a model based on a non-equilibrium drying transition.","(539, 20)","This research paper delves into the fascinating phenomena of boiling crisis and non-equilibrium drying transition from the perspective of thermodynamics and heat transfer. Boiling crisis is an abrupt and dramatic reduction in boiling efficiency, characterized by a sudden increase in surface temperature and a drop in heat transfer coefficient. Such a phenomenon can cause damage to critical heat transfer systems such as nuclear reactors, steam turbines, and electronic devices. In contrast, non-equilibrium drying transition is a transition from the film stage to the particulate stage, which often occurs during the drying of granular materials in the presence of a gas flow. Understanding the dynamics of these two transitions is of paramount importance in designing and optimizing thermal systems.

This research employs a combination of theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental measurements to investigate the fundamental mechanisms and thermophysical properties involved in boiling crisis and non-equilibrium drying transition. We first develop a comprehensive thermodynamic model to describe the dynamics of boiling crisis, which takes into account the effects of subcooled boiling and wall superheat. The model is validated by comparing its predictions to available experimental data and shows good agreement. We then use the model to explore the effects of different parameters, such as pressure, surface roughness, and liquid properties, on the onset and development of boiling crisis.

Next, we transfer our focus to non-equilibrium drying transition and investigate the evolution of particle size distribution and concentration during the transition. We perform numerical simulations based on a discrete element method to capture the motions of individual particles and their interactions with the gas flow. The simulations reveal that the transition is driven by a balance between the convective force and the interparticle cohesive force. We further validate the simulations by comparing the predictions to experiments using an optical microscope and laser diffraction. Our results show that the non-equilibrium drying transition can significantly affect the overall heat and mass transfer during drying.

Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of complex thermodynamic and transport phenomena related to boiling crisis and non-equilibrium drying transition. Our work can be used to design and optimize thermal systems with higher efficiency and reliability. Future research can further extend the study to more complex geometries and fluid systems and investigate the effects of surface geometry and material properties.","(412, 17)","Boiling crisis is the rapid formation of the quasi-continuous vapor film between the heater and
the boiling liquid. This phenomenon occurs when the heat flux exceeds the critical heat flux (CHF),
which is the maximum heat flux that can be transferred from the heater to the boiling liquid without
boiling crisis. Non-equilibrium drying transition (NEDT) is the transition from the equilibrium
drying regime to the non-equilibrium drying regime. In the equilibrium drying regime, the drying
rate is controlled by the evaporation of water from the surface of the material. In the non-equilibrium
drying regime, the drying rate is controlled by the diffusion of water through the material.
The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between boiling crisis and NEDT. The
research question is: What is the effect of boiling crisis on NEDT? The methodology used in this
study is experimental. The experimental setup consists of a heater, a boiling liquid, and a measuring
device. The heater is used to heat the boiling liquid, and the measuring device is used to measure the
heat flux and the temperature of the boiling liquid. The boiling liquid is water, and the measuring
device is a thermocouple.
The findings of this study show that boiling crisis has a significant effect on NEDT. When the heat
flux exceeds the CHF, boiling crisis occurs, and the boiling liquid forms a quasi-continuous vapor
film between the heater and the boiling liquid. This vapor film reduces the heat transfer from the
heater to the boiling liquid, which leads to a decrease in the drying rate. As a result, NEDT occurs.
The implications of this study are that boiling crisis should be taken into account when designing
drying processes. Boiling crisis can significantly reduce the drying rate, which can lead to longer
drying times and higher energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to design drying processes
that can operate at heat fluxes below the CHF to avoid boiling crisis.","(359, 18)",,

Context. Using observations to deduce dust properties, grain size distribution, and physical conditions in molecular
","Context. Using observations to deduce dust properties, grain size distribution, and physical conditions in molecular clouds is a highly degenerate problem. Aims. The coreshine phenomenon, a scattering process at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m that dominates absorption, has revealed its ability to explore the densest parts of clouds. We want to use this effect to constrain the dust parameters. The goal is to investigate to what extent grain growth (at constant dust mass) inside molecular clouds is able to explain the coreshine observations. We aim to find dust models that can explain a sample of Spitzer coreshine data. We also look at the consistency with near-infrared data we obtained for a few clouds. Methods. We selected four regions with a very high occurrence of coreshine cases: Taurus-Perseus, Cepheus, Chameleon and L183/L134. We built a grid of dust models and investigated the key parameters to reproduce the general trend of surface bright- nesses and intensity ratios of both coreshine and near-infrared observations with the help of a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. The grid parameters allow to investigate the effect of coagulation upon spherical grains up to 5 $\mu$m in size derived from the DustEm diffuse interstellar medium grains. Fluffiness (porosity or fractal degree), ices, and a handful of classical grain size distributions were also tested. We used the near- and mostly mid-infrared intensity ratios as strong discriminants between dust models. Results. The determination of the background field intensity at each wavelength is a key issue. In particular, an especially strong background field explains why we do not see coreshine in the Galactic plane at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. For starless cores, where detected, the observed 4.5 $\mu$m / 3.6 $\mu$m coreshine intensity ratio is always lower than $\sim$0.5 which is also what we find in the models for the Taurus-Perseus and L183 directions. Embedded sources can lead to higher fluxes (up to four times greater than the strongest starless core fluxes) and higher coreshine ratios (from 0.5 to 1.1 in our selected sample). Normal interstellar radiation field conditions are sufficient to find suitable grain models at all wavelengths for starless cores. The standard interstellar grains are not able to reproduce observations and, due to the multi-wavelength approach, only a few grain types meet the criteria set by the data. Porosity does not affect the flux ratios while the fractal dimension helps to explain coreshine ratios but does not seem able to reproduce near-infrared observations without a mix of other grain types. Conclusions. Combined near- and mid-infrared wavelengths confirm the potential to reveal the nature and size distribution of dust grains. Careful assessment of the environmental parameters (interstellar and background fields, embedded or nearby reddened sources) is required to validate this new diagnostic.","(519, 25)","Dust is a crucial component of the interstellar medium, contributing to the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. In particular, the study of dust properties inside molecular clouds is essential for understanding the physical conditions that lead to star formation. In this work, we present a study on the dust properties inside molecular clouds based on coreshine modeling and observations.

Coreshine is a phenomenon observed in dense cores of molecular clouds, where the emission from the dust at long wavelengths is enhanced due to scattering of the interstellar radiation field. We use the coreshine observations obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory and model them using a radiative transfer simulation code. Our aim is to derive the dust properties inside the cores, such as the dust temperature, opacity, and spectral index.

We find that the dust temperature inside the cores is generally lower than the surrounding cloud, which implies that the cores are shielded from the interstellar radiation field. The opacity of the dust is also higher inside the cores, indicating that the dust grains are larger and more abundant than in the surrounding cloud. The spectral index of the dust inside the cores is flatter than the surrounding cloud, indicating the presence of larger dust grains.

We also study the relation between the dust properties and the physical properties of the cores, such as their mass and size. We find that the dust temperature and spectral index are correlated with the core mass, implying that the more massive cores have lower temperatures and larger dust grains. We also find that the dust opacity is correlated with the core size, implying that the larger cores have more abundant and larger dust grains.

Finally, we compare our results with previous studies and theoretical models of dust properties inside molecular clouds. We find that our results are consistent with the idea that the dust properties inside the cores are determined by the physical conditions of the cores, such as the density and temperature. Our study provides important insights into the dust properties inside molecular clouds and their relation to star formation, which is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies.","(391, 15)","Context.

interstellar dust grains are illuminated by starlight, causing them to emit light in the near-infrared (NIR) and
mid-infrared (MIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. By studying coreshine, we can gain insights into the

Aims. The aim of this study is to investigate the dust properties inside molecular clouds using coreshine modeling

molecular clouds by analyzing coreshine data.
Methods. We will use a combination of coreshine models and observations to determine the dust properties inside

the scattering and absorption of starlight by interstellar dust grains. The observations will be obtained using
infrared telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter

Results. The results of this study will provide valuable insights into the dust properties and physical conditions

Conclusions. The conclusions of this study will have important implications for our understanding of the formation
of stars and planets. By determining the dust properties andphysical conditions within molecular clouds, we can gain
insights into the processes that lead to the formation of these celestial bodies. Additionally, the results of this
study can be used to improve our understanding of the evolution of galaxies and the universe as a whole.","(339, 18)",,

Context: Meta programming consists for a large part of matching, analyzing, and transforming syntax trees.
","Context: Meta programming consists for a large part of matching, analyzing, and transforming syntax trees. Many meta programming systems process abstract syntax trees, but this requires intimate knowledge of the structure of the data type describing the abstract syntax. As a result, meta programming is error-prone, and meta programs are not resilient to evolution of the structure of such ASTs, requiring invasive, fault-prone change to these programs.

Inquiry: Concrete syntax patterns alleviate this problem by allowing the meta programmer to match and create syntax trees using the actual syntax of the object language. Systems supporting concrete syntax patterns, however, require a concrete grammar of the object language in their own formalism. Creating such grammars is a costly and error-prone process, especially for realistic languages such as Java and C++. Approach: In this paper we present Concretely, a technique to extend meta programming systems with pluggable concrete syntax patterns, based on external, black box parsers. We illustrate Concretely in the context of Rascal, an open-source meta programming system and language workbench, and show how to reuse existing parsers for Java, JavaScript, and C++. Furthermore, we propose Tympanic, a DSL to declaratively map external AST structures to Rascal's internal data structures. Tympanic allows implementors of Concretely to solve the impedance mismatch between object-oriented class hierarchies in Java and Rascal's algebraic data types. Both the algebraic data type and AST marshalling code is automatically generated. Knowledge: The conceptual architecture of Concretely and Tympanic supports the reuse of pre-existing, external parsers, and their AST representation in meta programming systems that feature concrete syntax patterns for matching and constructing syntax trees. As such this opens up concrete syntax pattern matching for a host of realistic languages for which writing a grammar from scratch is time consuming and error-prone, but for which industry-strength parsers exist in the wild. Grounding: We evaluate Concretely in terms of source lines of code (SLOC), relative to the size of the AST data type and marshalling code. We show that for real programming languages such as C++ and Java, adding support for concrete syntax patterns takes an effort only in the order of dozens of SLOC. Similarly, we evaluate Tympanic in terms of SLOC, showing an order of magnitude of reduction in SLOC compared to manual implementation of the AST data types and marshalling code. Importance: Meta programming has applications in reverse engineering, reengineering, source code analysis, static analysis, software renovation, domain-specific language engineering, and many others. Processing of syntax trees is central to all of these tasks.

Concrete syntax patterns improve the practice of constructing meta programs.

The combination of Concretely and Tympanic has the potential to make concrete syntax patterns available with very little effort, thereby improving and promoting the application of meta programming in the general software engineering context.","(524, 20)","Concrete syntax is an essential component of computer languages. Despite its critical role, the development of tools to support it has been slow. Black box parsers, however, offer a potential solution to this longstanding issue. By treating the syntax of languages as abstract objects, black box parsers provide a way to create languages without being bound by specific syntax rules.

The flexibility of black box parsers is one of their key advantages. Rather than relying on a specific set of syntax rules, they can parse input according to any set of rules. This enables developers to experiment with different syntaxes, create syntaxes that fit their specific needs, or even build new languages that are not bound by traditional syntax rules.

Another benefit of black box parsers is their ability to facilitate the use of concrete syntax in large-scale software projects. With black box parsers, developers can separate the concerns of language specification and language use. This allows developers to focus their efforts on the parts of the software that matter most, without being bogged down by the intricacies of language syntax.

In addition to their flexibility and scalability, black box parsers are also highly efficient. They can rapidly parse large amounts of code, making them an ideal solution for complex software projects.

Despite their many advantages, black box parsers are not without their limitations. For one, they can be difficult to understand, particularly for developers who are not familiar with their inner workings. Additionally, because of their abstract nature, it can be challenging to create error messages that are helpful to end-users.

Nonetheless, the potential benefits of black box parsers make them a promising tool for software development. They offer a flexible, scalable, and efficient way of incorporating concrete syntax into large-scale software projects. While there are still challenges to be addressed, black box parsers represent a significant step forward in the development of computer languages.","(354, 18)","Context: Meta programming consists for a large part of matching, analyzing, and transforming syntax trees.

This approach has several advantages over traditional approaches to meta programming, including increased flexibility, reduced complexity, and improved performance.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using it to implement a variety of meta programming tasks, including code generation, code analysis, and code transformation.
Methodology: Our approach to meta programming is based on the use of black box parsers.
A black box parser is a program that takes as input a piece of source code and produces as output a syntax tree representing the structure of the code.
By using black box parsers, we can avoid the need to manually construct syntax trees, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone process.
Instead, we can simply provide the parser with the source code and let it do the work of constructing the syntax tree.
Findings: We found that our approach to meta programming using black box parsers was effective in a variety of tasks.
For example, we were able to use it to generate code for a variety of languages, including C++, Java, and Python.
We also used it to analyze code for security vulnerabilities and to transform code to improve its performance.

The analysis of practical probabilistic models on the computer demands a convenient representation for the
","The analysis of practical probabilistic models on the computer demands a convenient representation for the available knowledge and an efficient algorithm to perform inference. An appealing representation is the influence diagram, a network that makes explicit the random variables in a model and their probabilistic dependencies. Recent advances have developed solution procedures based on the influence diagram. In this paper, we examine the fundamental properties that underlie those techniques, and the information about the probabilistic structure that is available in the influence diagram representation. The influence diagram is a convenient representation for computer processing while also being clear and non-mathematical. It displays probabilistic dependence precisely, in a way that is intuitive for decision makers and experts to understand and communicate. As a result, the same influence diagram can be used to build, assess and analyze a model, facilitating changes in the formulation and feedback from sensitivity analysis.

The goal in this paper is to determine arbitrary conditional probability distributions from a given probabilistic model. Given qualitative information about the dependence of the random variables in the model we can, for a specific conditional expression, specify precisely what quantitative information we need to be able to determine the desired conditional probability distribution. It is also shown how we can find that probability distribution by performing operations locally, that is, over subspaces of the joint distribution. In this way, we can exploit the conditional independence present in the model to avoid having to construct or manipulate the full joint distribution. These results are extended to include maximal processing when the information available is incomplete, and optimal decision making in an uncertain environment. Influence diagrams as a computer-aided modeling tool were developed by Miller, Merkofer, and Howard [5] and extended by Howard and Matheson [2]. Good descriptions of how to use them in modeling are in Owen [7] and Howard and Matheson [2]. The notion of solving a decision problem through influence diagrams was examined by Olmsted [6] and such an algorithm was developed by Shachter [8]. The latter paper also shows how influence diagrams can be used to perform a variety of sensitivity analyses. This paper extends those results by developing a theory of the properties of the diagram that are used by the algorithm, and the information needed to solve arbitrary probability inference problems. Section 2 develops the notation and the framework for the paper and the relationship between influence diagrams and joint probability distributions. The general probabilistic inference problem is posed in Section 3. In Section 4 the transformations on the diagram are developed and then put together into a solution procedure in Section 5. In Section 6, this procedure is used to calculate the information requirement to solve an inference problem and the maximal processing that can be performed with incomplete information. Section 7 contains a summary of results.","(521, 22)","Intelligent probabilistic inference is a process that determines the likelihood of events occurring based on available evidence. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to probabilistic inference that leverages the power of machine learning to make intelligent decisions.

Traditional probabilistic inference methods are usually rigid, inflexible, and only work under a limited range of assumptions. In contrast, our approach utilizes advancements made in deep learning to handle noisy and incomplete data, and adapt to changing circumstances.

At the core of our approach is a probabilistic graphical model that encodes the relationships between different variables in the system. This allows us to model complex systems and capture uncertainty in a structured way. We employ variational inference to infer the posterior distribution of unobserved variables, which enables us to make predictions about the system.

However, standard variational inference methods are often computationally expensive and cannot handle large datasets. To address this, we leverage techniques such as stochastic gradient descent and amortized inference to scale up the inference process.

Our experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional probabilistic inference methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a range of tasks, including image classification and language modeling.

One advantage of our approach is its ability to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the probabilistic model. For example, we can encode expert knowledge of a domain into the structure of the graphical model, improving its ability to make intelligent predictions.

In addition to its application in machine learning, our approach has practical implications for decision-making in areas such as finance, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles. For example, our approach could be used to predict the likelihood of a stock market crash or determine the optimal dosage for a patient.

Overall, our research presents a novel approach to probabilistic inference that combines the benefits of machine learning with structured probabilistic modeling. Our approach is highly flexible, adaptive, and scalable, making it well-suited for real-world applications.","(366, 17)","The analysis of practical probabilistic models on the computer demands a convenient representation for the
probabilistic structure of the model. The most common representation is the joint probability table (JPT), which
represents the joint distribution of all random variables in the model. However, JPTs are often too large to be
practically useful. For example, a model with 100 binary random variables has a JPT with 2^100 = 1.26 x 10^30
entries, which is far too large to be stored in a computer's main memory. In this paper, we propose a new
representation for probabilistic models that is more compact than the JPT. We call this representation the
intelligent probabilistic inference (IPI) representation. The IPI representation is based on the observation that
many probabilistic models can be represented as a set of conditional probability tables (CPTs), where each CPT
represents the conditional distribution of a single random variable given the values of its parents. The IPI
representation consists of a set of CPTs, along with a set of rules that specify how to combine the CPTs to
compute the joint distribution of any subset of the random variables. We show that the IPI representation is more
compact than the JPT, and we provide an algorithm for computing the joint distribution from the IPI
representation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the IPI representation by applying it to several
real-world probabilistic models.","(256, 10)",,

The first purpose of this paper is to point out a curious result announced by
","The first purpose of this paper is to point out a curious result announced by Macaulay on the Hilbert function of a differential module in his famous book The Algebraic Theory of Modular Systems published in 1916. Indeed, on page 78/79 of this book, Macaulay is saying the following: "" A polynomial ideal $\mathfrak{a} \subset k[{\chi}\_1$,..., ${\chi}\_n]=k[\chi]$ is of the {\it principal class} and thus {\it unmixed} if it has rank $r$ and is generated by $r$ polynomials. Having in mind this definition, a primary ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ with associated prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} = rad(\mathfrak{q})$ is such that any ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{q}$ determines a primary ideal of greater {\it multiplicity} over $k$. In particular, we have $dim\_k(k[\chi]/({\chi}\_1$,...,${\chi}\_n)^2)=n+1$ because, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the parametric jets are \{${y,y\_1, ...,y\_n}$\} but any ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\mathfrak{a}\subset ({\chi}\_1,{\^a},{\chi}\_n)^2$ is contained into a {\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ such that $rad(\mathfrak{q})=\mathfrak{m}\in max(k[\chi])$ is a maximal and thus prime ideal with $dim\_k(M)=dim\_k(k[\chi]/\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least.

Accordingly, any primary ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the primary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\mathfrak{a} \subseteq \mathfrak{q}$ of the principal class. Otherwise, $\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\it principal noetherian class} "". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern language and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The importance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit symbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of this example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the system of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this reason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is presented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky.

Meanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by Macaulay in order to study {\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular examples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been introduced recently in order to study {\it pure differential modules}. However these procedures are based on the formal theory of systems of ordinary differential (OD) or partial differential (PD) equations, in particular on a systematic use of the Spencer operator, and are still not acknowledged by the algebraic community.","(640, 12)","This paper investigates the properties of pure differential modules and their relationship to unmixed polynomial ideals. We begin by defining pure differential modules and exploring their basic algebraic properties. We then present a result of Macaulay which characterizes unmixed polynomial ideals in terms of their associated graded rings. Specifically, Macaulay showed that an ideal is unmixed if and only if its associated graded ring is Cohen-Macaulay.

Using this result, we show that certain classes of pure differential modules are closely related to the Cohen-Macaulay property. In particular, we prove that a pure differential module is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if its associated graded ring is Cohen-Macaulay. This provides a powerful tool for studying pure differential modules and their associated polynomial ideals.

We then turn our attention to a specific example of an unmixed polynomial ideal: the ideal of minors of a matrix. We show that this ideal is Cohen-Macaulay, and use this fact to derive some interesting consequences regarding the geometry of the set of singular matrices. In particular, we show that the set of singular matrices is a union of Zariski closed subsets of strictly smaller dimension. This provides a new perspective on the geometry of matrix singularities, and opens up new avenues for research.

Finally, we apply our results to the study of certain special classes of algebraic varieties, known as Schubert varieties. We show that the ideal of a Schubert variety is unmixed, and hence Cohen-Macaulay. This allows us to compute the Hilbert series of Schubert varieties in terms of certain combinatorial data, known as Schubert polynomials. We also derive some interesting consequences regarding the cohomology of Schubert varieties, showing that it can be expressed in terms of the cohomology of certain Schubert cells.

In summary, this paper provides a detailed study of pure differential modules and their relationship to unmixed polynomial ideals. Using a result of Macaulay, we show that certain classes of pure differential modules are closely related to the Cohen-Macaulay property. We then apply these results to the study of the geometry of singular matrices and the cohomology of Schubert varieties.

Context: Compilation time is an important factor in the adaptability of a software project. Fast
","Context: Compilation time is an important factor in the adaptability of a software project. Fast recompilation enables cheap experimentation with changes to a project, as those changes can be tested quickly. Separate and incremental compilation has been a topic of interest for a long time to facilitate fast recompilation.

Inquiry: Despite the benefits of an incremental compiler, such compilers are usually not the default. This is because incrementalization requires cross-cutting, complicated, and error-prone techniques such as dependency tracking, caching, cache invalidation, and change detection. Especially in compilers for languages with cross-module definitions and integration, correctly and efficiently implementing an incremental compiler can be a challenge. Retrofitting incrementality into a compiler is even harder. We address this problem by developing a compiler design approach that reuses parts of an existing non-incremental compiler to lower the cost of building an incremental compiler. It also gives an intuition into compiling difficult-to-incrementalize language features through staging.

Approach: We use the compiler design approach presented in this paper to develop an incremental compiler for the Stratego term-rewriting language. This language has a set of features that at first glance look incompatible with incremental compilation. Therefore, we treat Stratego as our critical case to demonstrate the approach on. We show how this approach decomposes the original compiler and has a solution to compile Stratego incrementally. The key idea on which we build our incremental compiler is to internally use an incremental build system to wire together the components we extract from the original compiler.

Knowledge: The resulting compiler is already in use as a replacement of the original whole-program compiler. We find that the incremental build system inside the compiler is a crucial component of our approach. This allows a compiler writer to think in multiple steps of compilation, and combine that into a incremental compiler almost effortlessly. Normally, separate compilation \`a la C is facilitated by an external build system, where the programmer is responsible for managing dependencies between files. We reuse an existing sound and optimal incremental build system, and integrate its dependency tracking into the compiler.

Grounding: The incremental compiler for Stratego is available as an artefact along with this article. We evaluate it on a large Stratego project to test its performance. The benchmark replays edits to the Stratego project from version control. These benchmarks are part of the artefact, packaged as a virtual machine image for easy reproducibility.

Importance: Although we demonstrate our design approach on the Stratego programming language, we also describe it generally throughout this paper. Many currently used programming languages have a compiler that is much slower than necessary. Our design provides an approach to change this, by reusing an existing compiler and making it incremental within a reasonable amount of time.","(504, 26)","With the increasing complexity of software systems, extensibility has become a key concern for developers. Hybrid incremental compilers are attractive for cross-module extensibility because they allow one to modify parts of the system without having to rebuild the entire application. However, the construction of a hybrid incremental compiler can be challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining consistency across modules. 

In this research paper, we propose a method for constructing hybrid incremental compilers that is designed to facilitate cross-module extensibility. Our method relies on an internal build system that separates compilation units into two categories: ""stable"" and ""unstable"". Stable modules can be compiled incrementally, while unstable modules are recompiled every time they are modified. The overall goal of this system is to minimize recompilation time, while ensuring consistent build artifacts across modules.

To evaluate our approach, we performed a case study in which we developed an extensible compiler for a subset of the Java programming language. We found that our method significantly reduced build times, and made it easier to add new language features. We also identified some limitations of our approach, such as the need for manual tuning of unstable modules and the potential for conflicts between different versions of stable modules.

Overall, our research provides a novel approach to constructing hybrid incremental compilers for cross-module extensibility. By utilizing an internal build system and carefully managing compilation units, we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce recompilation times and facilitate the addition of new features to complex software systems. Our work provides a starting point for further exploration of this topic, and we hope that other researchers will build on our approach to improve the extensibility of software systems.","(309, 13)","Context: Compilation time is an important factor in the adaptability of a software project. Fast
compilation times allow developers to quickly iterate on their code, while slow compilation times can
lead to frustration and decreased productivity. One way to improve compilation times is to use
incremental compilation, which only recompiles the parts of the code that have changed since the last
build. However, incremental compilation can be difficult to implement and maintain, especially in large
software projects with many dependencies. In this paper, we present a novel approach to constructing
hybrid incremental compilers for cross-module extensibility with an internal build system. Our approach
combines the benefits of both incremental and non-incremental compilation, allowing developers to
quickly iterate on their code while still maintaining fast compilation times. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through a case study on a large software project, showing that our
approach can significantly reduce compilation times compared to traditional non-incremental
compilation methods.","(172, 7)",,

","Let $b$ be a $BMO$-function. It is well-known that the linear commutator $[b, T]$ of a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator $T$ does not, in general, map continuously $H^1(\mathbb R^n)$ into $L^1(\mathbb R^n)$. However, P\'erez showed that if $H^1(\mathbb R^n)$ is replaced by a suitable atomic subspace $\mathcal H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ then the commutator is continuous from $\mathcal H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ into $L^1(\mathbb R^n)$. In this paper, we find the largest subspace $H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ such that all commutators of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators are continuous from $H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ into $L^1(\mathbb R^n)$.

Some equivalent characterizations of $H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ are also given. We also study the commutators $[b,T]$ for $T$ in a class $\mathcal K$ of sublinear operators containing almost all important operators in harmonic analysis. When $T$ is linear, we prove that there exists a bilinear operators $\mathfrak R= \mathfrak R_T$ mapping continuously $H^1(\mathbb R^n)\times BMO(\mathbb R^n)$ into $L^1(\mathbb R^n)$ such that for all $(f,b)\in H^1(\mathbb R^n)\times BMO(\mathbb R^n)$, we have \label{abstract 1} [b,T](f)= \mathfrak R(f,b) + T(\mathfrak S(f,b)), where $\mathfrak S$ is a bounded bilinear operator from $H^1(\mathbb R^n)\times BMO(\mathbb R^n)$ into $L^1(\mathbb R^n)$ which does not depend on $T$. In the particular case of $T$ a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator satisfying $T1=T^*1=0$ and $b$ in $BMO^{\rm log}(\mathbb R^n)$-- the generalized $\BMO$ type space that has been introduced by Nakai and Yabuta to characterize multipliers of $\BMO(\bR^n)$ --we prove that the commutator $[b,T]$ maps continuously $H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ into $h^1(\mathbb R^n)$. Also, if $b$ is in $BMO(\mathbb R^n)$ and $T^*1 = T^*b = 0$, then the commutator $[b, T]$ maps continuously $H^1_b (\mathbb R^n)$ into $H^1(\mathbb R^n)$. When $T$ is sublinear, we prove that there exists a bounded subbilinear operator $\mathfrak R= \mathfrak R_T: H^1(\mathbb R^n)\times BMO(\mathbb R^n)\to L^1(\mathbb R^n)$ such that for all $(f,b)\in H^1(\mathbb R^n)\times BMO(\mathbb R^n)$, we have \label{abstract 2} |T(\mathfrak S(f,b))|- \mathfrak R(f,b)\leq |[b,T](f)|\leq \mathfrak R(f,b) + |T(\mathfrak S(f,b))|.

The bilinear decomposition (\ref{abstract 1}) and the subbilinear decomposition (\ref{abstract 2}) allow us to give a general overview of all known weak and strong $L^1$-estimates.","(648, 11)","In this paper, we explore the theory of bilinear decompositions and commutators of singular integral operators. Singular integrals are essential tools in the study of partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. In particular, they are used to establish the regularity and decay properties of solutions to these equations. However, in some cases, the study of singular integrals can be quite challenging due to their complicated structure. Bilinear decompositions and commutators provide a powerful tool to overcome these difficulties.

We begin by introducing the concept of singular integrals and their basic properties. We then focus on the bilinear decomposition of singular integrals, which decomposes them into simpler terms that are easier to analyze. We discuss different methods for constructing bilinear decompositions, including the Riesz transform method and the Littlewood-Paley method.

We then turn our attention to commutators, which are a useful tool for studying the boundedness and compactness of singular integral operators. Commutators are defined as the difference between a singular integral operator and a related operator. We explore the theory of commutators and present some of the key results in the field. In particular, we discuss the boundedness and compactness of commutators on different function spaces.

We also investigate the relationship between bilinear decompositions and commutators. We show that bilinear decompositions can be used to establish the boundedness and compactness of commutators. We present some examples that illustrate this relationship and discuss the advantages of using bilinear decompositions to study commutators.

Finally, we apply our results to the study of specific singular integral operators, including the Hilbert transform and the Calderón-Zygmund operators. We provide detailed analysis of these operators using bilinear decompositions and commutators, and demonstrate the power of these techniques in solving difficult problems in harmonic analysis.

Recovery of oil from oil shales and the natural primary migration of hydrocarbons are closely
","Recovery of oil from oil shales and the natural primary migration of hydrocarbons are closely related processes that have received renewed interests in recent years because of the ever tightening supply of conventional hydrocarbons and the growing production of hydrocarbons from low permeability tight rocks. Quantitative models for conversion of kerogen into oil and gas and the timing of hydrocarbon generation have been well documented. However, lack of consensus about the kinetics of hydrocarbon formation in source rocks, expulsion timing and how the resulting hydrocarbons escape from or are retained in the source rocks motivates further investigation. In particular, many mechanisms for the transport of hydrocarbons from the source rocks in which they are generated into adjacent rocks with higher permeabilities and smaller capillary entry pressures have been proposed, and a better understanding of this complex process (primary migration) is needed. To characterize these processes it is imperative to use the latest technological advances. In this study, it is shown how insights into hydrocarbon migration in source rocks can be obtained by using sequential high resolution synchrotron X-ray tomography.

Three-dimensional (3D) images of several immature ""shale"" samples were constructed at resolutions close to 5 micrometers. This is sufficient to resolve the source rock structure down to the grain level, but very fine grained silt particles, clay particles and colloids cannot be resolved. Samples used in this investigation came from the R-8 unit in the upper part of the Green River Shale, which is organic rich, varved, lacustrine marl formed in Eocene Lake Uinta, United States of America. One Green River Shale sample was heated in-situ up to 400{\deg}C as X-ray tomography images were recorded. The other samples were scanned before and after heating at 400{\deg}C. During the heating phase, the organic matter was decomposed, and gas was released. Gas expulsion from the low permeability shales was coupled with formation of microcracks. The main technical difficulty was numerical extraction of microcracks that have apertures in the 5 to 30 micrometer range (with 5 micrometers being the resolution limit) from a large 3D volume of X-ray attenuation data. The main goal of the work presented here is to develop a methodology to process these 3D data and image the cracks. This methodology is based on several levels of spatial filtering and automatic recognition of connected domains. Supportive petrographic and thermogravimetric data were an important complement to this study. An investigation of the strain field using two-dimensional image correlation analyses was also performed. As one application of the four-dimensional (4D, space + time) microtomography and the developed workflow, we show that fluid generation was accompanied by crack formation. Under different conditions, in the subsurface, this might provide paths for primary migration.","(503, 19)","This study employs 4D synchrotron X-ray tomography to investigate the formation of hydrocarbon migration pathways in heated organic-rich shale. The study uses in-situ observations of the shale samples under progressively increasing temperatures and pressures to track the evolution of porosity, permeability, and channels for fluid flow. 

The results show that heating the organic-rich shale to temperatures above 200°C leads to significant changes in the shale's lithology, with increased cracking and porosity resulting from deformation and stress on the mineral matrix. The observations further suggest that at above 250°C, the formerly continuous organic-rich layer undergoes significant thermal decomposition into various hydrocarbons. 

The X-ray results reveal the formation of hydrocarbon migration pathways above 300°C, with the networks of channels and micropores forming a hierarchical structure within the shale. These pathways subsequently facilitate fluid flow, with the highest permeability zones emerging inside the shale's organic-rich layer. The observed channels and permeability have a profound impact on petroleum recovery, and the data collected here can inform development of hydrocarbon resources in shale reservoirs.

The study of heated organic-rich shale at nanoscale resolution under in-situ conditions allowed identification of the various mechanisms that govern hydrocarbon migration in shale rocks. This was made possible by the combination of high-resolution 4D synchrotron X-ray tomography and the in-situ environmental reaction cell that provided the necessary environment for studying the evolution and behavior of shale samples under progressively increasing temperatures. 

In conclusion, the study provides a highly detailed and visual description of the evolution of hydrocarbon migration pathways formation in heated organic-rich shale. The proposed mechanism, derived from detailed X-ray tomography observation, could help explain the characteristics of geological reservoirs and guide strategies for managing unconventional hydrocarbon resources.","(302, 11)","Recovery of oil from oil shales and the natural primary migration of hydrocarbons are closely
related processes. In this study, we used synchrotron-based X-ray computed tomography (CT) to
investigate the evolution of porosity and permeability in an organic-rich shale sample during
heating. The sample was heated to temperatures ranging from 100°C to 300°C at a rate of 1°C/min
and then held at each temperature for 24 hours. The CT scans were performed at each temperature,
and the resulting images were analyzed to determine the changes in porosity and pore size
distribution. The results showed that the porosity increased with increasing temperature, with the
largest increase occurring between 200°C and 300°C. The pore size distribution also changed with
temperature, with the largest pores becoming more abundant at higher temperatures. The
permeability of the sample was also measured at each temperature, and it was found to increase
with increasing temperature. These results suggest that heating can significantly increase the
porosity and permeability of organic-rich shales, which could have important implications for the
recovery of oil from these rocks.","(192, 8)",,

Reaction-diffusion analytical modeling of predator-prey systems has shown that specialist natural enemies can slow, stop
","Reaction-diffusion analytical modeling of predator-prey systems has shown that specialist natural enemies can slow, stop and even reverse pest invasions, assuming that the prey population displays a strong Allee effect in its growth.

Few additional analytical results have been obtained for other spatially distributed predator-prey systems, as traveling waves of non-monotonous systems are notoriously difficult to obtain. Traveling waves have indeed recently been shown to exist in predator-prey systems, but the direction of the wave, an essential item of information in the context of the control of biological invasions, is generally unknown. Preliminary numerical explorations have hinted that control by generalist predators might be possible for prey populations displaying logistic growth. We aimed to formalize the conditions in which spatial biological control can be achieved by generalists, through an analytical approach based on reaction-diffusion equations. The population of the focal prey - the invader - is assumed to grow according to a logistic function. The predator has a type II functional response and is present everywhere in the domain, at its carrying capacity, on alternative hosts.

Control, defined as the invader becoming extinct in the domain, may result from spatially independent demographic dynamics or from a spatial extinction wave.

Using comparison principles, we obtain sufficient conditions for control and for invasion, based on scalar bistable partial differential equations (PDEs).

The searching efficiency and functional response plateau of the predator are identified as the main parameters defining the parameter space for prey extinction and invasion. Numerical explorations are carried out in the region of those control parameters space between the super-and subso-lutions, in which no conclusion about controllability can be drawn on the basis of analytical solutions. The ability of generalist predators to control prey populations with logistic growth lies in the bis-table dynamics of the coupled system, rather than in the bistability of prey-only dynamics as observed for specialist predators attacking prey populations displaying Allee effects. The consideration of space in predator-prey systems involving generalist predators with a parabolic functional response is crucial. Analysis of the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) system identifies parameter regions with monostable (extinction) and bistable (extinction or invasion) dynamics. By contrast, analysis of the associated PDE system distinguishes different and additional regions of invasion and extinction. Depending on the relative positions of these different zones, four patterns of spatial dynamics can be identified : traveling waves of extinction and invasion, pulse waves of extinction and heterogeneous stationary positive solutions of the Turing type.

As a consequence, prey control is predicted to be possible when space is considered in additional situations other than those identified without considering space. The reverse situation is also possible. None of these considerations apply to spatial predator-prey systems with specialist natural enemies.","(496, 19)","This study focuses on the phenomenon of bistability that natural enemies can induce and its potential to reverse pest invasions. Generalist natural enemies, as opposed to specialist ones, are found to have the capacity to induce bistability by attacking both the pest population and alternative prey. The theoretical framework proposes that this essentially causes the system to have at least two stable states, meaning that if the population of the pest reaches a certain threshold, the system will flip from its equilibrium state to a new, stable equilibrium state in which the pest population is greatly reduced. A practical prediction of this is that an increase in the density of generalist enemies may initially result in an increase in pest density, which can then sharply decrease if the threshold is crossed.

In addition to bistability, the paper discusses the factors that can disrupt this mechanism and prevent it from functioning as expected. The authors identify several such factors, including spatial heterogeneity, density-dependent regulation, and the presence of other trophic levels. Spatial heterogeneity, for example, can reduce the effectiveness of generalists by making it harder for them to encounter the pests. Density-dependent regulation, on the other hand, can make it more difficult for the system to cross the threshold by stabilizing the pest population below the necessary threshold. Moreover, the presence of other trophic levels can lead to complex dynamics by introducing additional ecological interactions into the system.

The paper also explores the effects of different types of generalist natural enemies and how they interact with other factors in the system. For example, the authors compare the effects of parasitoids and predators on pest invasions and find that the former are generally more effective at inducing bistability. They also investigate the effects of alternative prey, which can both add to the generalist's diet and potentially stabilize the pest population by providing an alternative food source.

Overall, the paper presents a theoretical framework for bistability in pest-invader systems and identifies several important factors that can influence its functioning. It also provides practical predictions and insights for pest management strategies, such as the potential use of generalist natural enemies as biological control agents. However, the paper also emphasizes the importance of understanding the limitations and potential disruptions of this mechanism, as well as the need for further empirical studies to validate the theoretical predictions and improve our understanding of these complex ecological systems.","(437, 15)","Reaction-diffusion analytical modeling of predator-prey systems has shown that specialist natural enemies can slow, stop
or even reverse pest invasions. However, the effect of generalist natural enemies on pest invasions is less well understood.
In this study, we use reaction-diffusion modeling to investigate the effect of generalists on pest invasions. We find that
generalist natural enemies can also slow, stop or reverse pest invasions, but the conditions under which this occurs are
different from those for specialist natural enemies. Specifically, we find that generalist natural enemies are more effective
at slowing, stopping or reversing pest invasions when they have a higher intrinsic growth rate and a lower dispersal rate
than the pest. Additionally, we find that the presence of a generalist natural enemy can lead to bistability in the system,
meaning that there are two stable equilibria: one where the pest is present and the other where the pest is absent. This
bistability can lead to hysteresis, meaning that the system can exhibit different behavior depending on its initial conditions.
For example, if the pest is initially present, it may remain present even if the generalist natural enemy is removed. However,
if the pest is initially absent, it may never become established even if the natural enemy is reintroduced. These findings
have important implications for the management of pest invasions, as they suggest that the use of generalist natural
enemies may be a more effective strategy than the use of specialist natural enemies in some cases. Additionally, these
findings highlight the importance of considering the potential for bistability and hysteresis in predator-prey systems.","(291, 11)",,

Aims. The comparative study of several molecular species at the origin of the gas phase
","Aims. The comparative study of several molecular species at the origin of the gas phase chemistry in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) is a key input in unraveling the coupled chemical and dynamical evolution of the ISM. Methods.

The lowest rotational lines of HCO+, HCN, HNC, and CN were observed at the IRAM-30m telescope in absorption against the \lambda 3 mm and \lambda 1.3 mm continuum emission of massive star-forming regions in the Galactic plane. The absorption lines probe the gas over kiloparsecs along these lines of sight. The excitation temperatures of HCO+ are inferred from the comparison of the absorptions in the two lowest transitions. The spectra of all molecular species on the same line of sight are decomposed into Gaussian velocity components.

Most appear in all the spectra of a given line of sight. For each component, we derived the central opacity, the velocity dispersion, and computed the molecular column density. We compared our results to the predictions of UV-dominated chemical models of photodissociation regions (PDR models) and to those of non-equilibrium models in which the chemistry is driven by the dissipation of turbulent energy (TDR models). Results. The molecular column densities of all the velocity components span up to two orders of magnitude.

Those of CN, HCN, and HNC are linearly correlated with each other with mean ratios N(HCN)/N(HNC) = 4.8 $\pm$ 1.3 and N(CN)/N(HNC) = 34 $\pm$ 12, and more loosely correlated with those of HCO+, N(HNC)/N(HCO+) = 0.5 $\pm$ 0.3, N(HCN)/N(HCO+) = 1.9 $\pm$ 0.9, and N(CN)/N(HCO+) = 18 $\pm$ 9. These ratios are similar to those inferred from observations of high Galactic latitude lines of sight, suggesting that the gas sampled by absorption lines in the Galactic plane has the same chemical properties as that in the Solar neighbourhood. The FWHM of the Gaussian velocity components span the range 0.3 to 3 km s-1 and those of the HCO+ lines are found to be 30% broader than those of CN-bearing molecules. The PDR models fail to reproduce simultaneously the observed abundances of the CN-bearing species and HCO+, even for high-density material (100 cm-3 < nH < 104 cm-3). The TDR models, in turn, are able to reproduce the observed abundances and abundance ratios of all the analysed molecules for the moderate gas densities (30 cm-3 < nH < 200 cm-3) and the turbulent energy observed in the diffuse interstellar medium. Conclusions. Intermittent turbulent dissipation appears to be a promising driver of the gas phase chemistry of the diffuse and translucent gas throughout the Galaxy. The details of the dissipation mechanisms still need to be investigated.","(523, 20)","This study presents a comparative investigation of four molecular absorption lines that stem from star-forming regions, namely HCO+, HNC, HCN, and CN. Using the ASAI Interferometer located at the Frontera del Universo observatory in Mexico, we have observed and analyzed the cloud complexes around several millimeter continuum sources. The study aims to investigate the chemical variations across different star-forming regions and identify the dominant chemical processes involved in the formation of these molecules.

Our results indicate that while the column densities of HCO+ and HCN are generally correlated, their ratios to the column densities of HNC and CN show significant variations across the observed clouds. Moreover, the Column density ratio of HCO+ to HCN is found to be higher toward star-forming regions with more massive and evolved stars, which suggests that the dominant chemical processes vary as a function of the star-forming environment.

We have also compared our data with recent observations of related molecules from the ASAI Interferometer and found that some of the observed variations can be attributed to the evolution of the source objects themselves. Furthermore, the column densities and line-of-sight velocities of the observed molecules appear to correlate with the physical parameters of the regions where they are found, such as the temperature and density of the surrounding gas.

To interpret our results, we have used a simple chemical model to simulate the evolution of a molecular cloud in the presence of a protostellar source. The model is consistent with some of the observed trends, showing that the relative abundances of the observed molecules vary as a function of the evolutionary state of the cloud and the molecular feedback from the protostar.

Overall, our study provides new insights into the chemical processes involved in star formation and highlights the importance of spectroscopic observations in determining the physical and chemical properties of these regions. Moreover, it suggests that the observed variations in the molecular absorption lines toward star-forming regions can be used as important probes of their underlying chemical and physical conditions.","(360, 11)","Aims. The comparative study of several molecular species at the origin of the gas phase

processes that lead to the formation of stars and planets. In this work, we present a

several SFRs in the Milky Way galaxy.
Methods. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the
molecular absorption lines of these species towards several SFRs. The data were reduced
and analyzed using the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package.
Results. We found that the absorption lines of all four species are detected towards all
the SFRs observed. The line profiles of HCO+ and HNC are similar, while those of HCN and
CN are more complex. The column densities of all four species decrease with increasing
distance from the center of the SFRs.
Conclusions. Our results suggest that the physical and chemical processes that lead to the
formation of stars and planets are similar in all the SFRs studied. However, the
differences in the line profiles of HCN and CN suggest that there may be variations in the
chemical composition of the gas phase in different SFRs. Further studies are needed to
understand the origin of these variations and their implications for the formation of
stars and planets.","(253, 14)",,

X-ray spectroscopy and coincidences experiment are planned. A prototype with a single HADP crystal with von Hamos geometry has been tested (resolution and efficiency). A fast time and position detector has been realized (patent and publication).We plan to build the spectrometer with 8 HADP (or 4) crystals under Helium atmosphere using a TimePix3 or a CCD camera. MOSARIX is a project of an x-ray spectrometer in the tender x-ray domain (2-5 keV) with high efficiency, allowing performing x-ray emission and coincidences (or covariance mapping) experiments using synchrotron radiation, XFEL, the future installation SPIRAL2/GANIL or CRYRING/FAIR. It involves 2 groups at LCPMR (Francis PENENT and Marc SIMON) and one group at INSP (Dominique VERNHET). The coincidences/covariance measurements will be between x-ray photons and ions or electrons. It would be the first time for such coincidences with energy-resolved photons. The spectrometer will be portable and will be brought to the different large-scale facilities. MOSARIX is a multi-crystal HAPG von Hamos spectrometer optimized for the 2-5 keV photon energy range. Its resolving power E/DE will be 4000. It will be equipped with a fast time and position sensitive detection system, allowing performing coincidences, or with a CCD camera. I. Scientific case and some possible experiments The accelerated development of x-ray sources, as 3 rd generation synchrotrons (and recent upgrades) or free-electron lasers, has opened new opportunities to investigate new phenomena by means of photoelectron and Auger spectroscopy, electron-ion coincidence techniques and x-ray emission. However, several processes of high scientific interests are still hard to measure; some of them require the measurement of photons with high efficiency, high resolution and even sometimes in coincidence mode. This is the purpose of MOSARIX development. As an example, we propose to revisit Resonance-Enhanced X-ray Multiple Ionization (REXMI) 1 with a significant amelioration of the detection of photons, i.e. measuring the photons not only with high efficiency and high resolution but also in coincidence with ions or electrons. This will allow accessing the involved intermediate states and obtaining a clearer image of the dynamic of the multiple ionization process. MOSARIX can also be used for the investigation of very low cross-section phenomena such as attosecond electron dynamics 2 and High-Energy Resolution Off-Resonant Spectroscopy (HEROS) 3,4. X-ray spectroscopy has also proved to be a very powerful tool to investigate quantum dynamics in heavy ions collisions with matter of whatever nature, dilute or condensed 5-7. A","(484, 22)","This progress report provides an overview of advancements and outcomes in the development of the MOSARIX system, a revolutionary technology designed for intelligent and autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Despite the challenges posed by the complex algorithms and machine learning techniques required, this ambitious goal has been successfully achieved for some tasks.

Among the key advancements highlighted in this progress report, we present the improvements in the system's sensing abilities, which enable it to estimate its position and orientation with greater accuracy, and the enhanced perception of the environment, which allows it to recognize objects and obstacles in real-time. Both enhancements have resulted in improved control of the UAVs, making them safer, more reliable, and more efficient.

Another noteworthy aspect of the MOSARIX system is its adaptability to different environments and situations, whether it be navigating through a forest, tracking a vehicle on a highway, or inspecting a power grid. The adaptability is made possible by the integration of multiple sensors and a modular software architecture.

Additionally, the report presents experimental results demonstrating the system's effectiveness when used in real-world scenarios. For instance, during a forest monitoring mission, MOSARIX was able to detect anomalies and changes in the vegetation, monitor the temperature, and identify potential risks such as forest fires. Similarly, during an urban search and rescue operation, the system successfully navigated through a simulated disaster zone to find survivors, while avoiding obstacles and hazards.

Finally, the report highlights some of the challenges and limitations of the MOSARIX system, including the need for further improvements in the system's algorithms to handle more complex tasks and scenarios, and the need for more robust and reliable communication systems to ensure seamless integration with other platforms.

Context. Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced by the explosions of massive stars that
","Context. Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced by the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN explosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been observed before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as SN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still unclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the existence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with superwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN progenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on the nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments, in particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain metallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn, SNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values from the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity distributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other core-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between metallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs tend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.

Among SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to those of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower metallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe IIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs (that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe IIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized Cumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II regions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities at higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during SN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM quiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in metallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the progenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly arising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds likely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors, metallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these transients. Key words. supernovae: general - stars: evolution - galaxies: abundances","(513, 26)","This research paper explores the relationship between the metallicity of interacting transients and the explosion sites. Metallicity is a term used to describe the proportion of elements in a given object that are not hydrogen or helium. In this study, we investigate how metallicity affects the behavior of interacting transients, specifically in regards to their explosion sites.

To conduct this study, we first collected data on interacting transients from a variety of sources. We then analyzed this data using statistical methods to determine the relationship between metallicity and explosion sites. Our results show that there is a significant correlation between higher metallicity and explosion sites that are more centrally located.

We also found that there is an inverse relationship between metallicity and the distance between explosion sites and the centers of interacting transients. This suggests that transients with lower metallicity may be more likely to have explosion sites that are further away from their center of mass.

Overall, our findings suggest that metallicity plays an important role in determining the location of explosion sites in interacting transients. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms behind this relationship and to determine whether other factors, such as the mass of the interacting transients, also play a role in determining explosion site location.

These results have implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. By studying the metallicity of interacting transients and their explosion sites, we can gain insights into the chemical composition of these objects and the physical processes that govern their behavior. Additionally, our findings may have practical applications in fields such as astrophysics and astronomy, where a deeper understanding of the behavior and characteristics of interacting transients is of great importance.

In conclusion, this research paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of astrophysics by highlighting the important role of metallicity in determining the location of explosion sites in interacting transients. By further investigating this relationship, we can gain greater insights into the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies, and advance our understanding of the physical processes that underlie the behavior of these objects.","(379, 15)","Context. Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced by the explosions of massive stars that
were stripped of their hydrogen envelopes prior to core collapse. The progenitors of these SNe are thought to be
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, which have lost their hydrogen envelopes due to strong stellar winds. However, the metallicity
at the explosion sites of CSI SNe has not been well studied. In this paper, we investigate the metallicity at the explosion
sites of CSI SNe using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX).
Methods. We use the SDSS and GALEX data to identify CSI SNe and their host galaxies. We then calculate the
metallicity of the host galaxies using the emission-line ratios of [N II]/Hα and [O III]/Hβ. We compare the metallicity
of the host galaxies of CSI SNe with those of other types of SNe.
Results. We find that the host galaxies of most CSI SNe have lower metallicity than the host galaxies of other types
of SNe. This suggests that CSI SNe are more likely to occur in low-metallicity environments. We also find that the
host galaxies of some CSI SNe have higher metallicity than the average metallicity of the Milky Way. This suggests
that CSI SNe can occur in high-metallicity environments as well.
Implications. Our results suggest that the metallicity of the explosion site is an important factor in determining the

","Some implants have approximately a lifetime of 15 years. The femoral stem, for example, should be made of 316L/316LN stainless steel. Fretting corrosion, friction under small displacements, should occur during human gait, due to repeated loadings and un-loadings, between stainless steel and bone for instance. Some experimental investigations of fretting corrosion have been practiced. As well known, metallic alloys and especially stainless steels are covered with a passive film that prevents from the corrosion and degradation.

This passive layer of few nanometers, at ambient temperature, is the key of our civilization according to some authors. This work is dedicated to predict the passive layer thicknesses of stainless steel under fretting corrosion with a specific emphasis on the role of proteins. The model is based on the Point Defect Model (micro scale) and an update of the model on the friction process (micro-macro scale). Genetic algorithm was used for finding solution of the problem. The major results are, as expected from experimental results, albumin prevents from degradation at the lowest concentration of chlorides; an incubation time is necessary for degrading the passive film; under fretting corrosion and high concentration of chlorides the passive behavior is annihilated.

Les implants orthop\'ediques de hanche ont une dur\'ee de vie d'environ 15 ans. Par exemple, la tige f\'emorale d'un tel implant peut \^etre r\'ealis\'ee en acier inoxydable 316L ou 316LN. Le fretting corrosion, frottement sous petits d\'eplacements, peut se produire pendant la marche humaine en raison des chargements r\'ep\'et\'es entre le m\'etal de la proth\`ese et l'os. Plusieurs investigations exp\'erimentales du fretting corrosion ont \'et\'e entreprises.

Cette couche passive de quelques nanom\`etres, \`a temp\'erature ambiante, est le point clef sur lequel repose le d\'eveloppement de notre civilisation, selon certains auteurs. Ce travail vise \`a pr\'edire les \'epaisseurs de cette couche passive de l'acier inoxydable soumis au fretting corrosion, avec une attention sp\'ecifique sur le r\^ole des prot\'eines. Le mod\`ele utilis\'e est bas\'e sur le Point Defect Model, PDM (\`a une \'echelle microscopique) et une am\'elioration de ce mod\`ele en prenant en compte le processus de frottement sous petits d\'ebattements. L'algorithme g\'en\'etique a \'et\'e utilis\'e pour optimiser la convergence du probl\`eme. Les r\'esultats les plus importants sont, comme d\'emontr\'e avec les essais exp\'erimentaux, que l'albumine, la prot\'eine \'etudi\'ee, emp\^eche les d\'egradations de l'acier inoxydable aux plus faibles concentrations d'ions chlorure ; ensuite, aux plus fortes concentrations de chlorures, un temps d'incubation est n\'ecessaire pour d\'etruire le film passif.","(482, 19)","This study focuses on the use of the Point Defect Model (PDM) to predict the steady state thickness of passive films in fretting corrosion experiments. Fretting corrosion is a complex form of wear that occurs between two surfaces subjected to oscillatory movements. The formation and growth of passive films play a critical role in mitigating fretting corrosion. The success of passive films depends on their thickness, which needs to be optimized to achieve the best protection against corrosion.

To predict the steady-state thickness of passive films, the Point Defect Model is employed. This model allows for a description of the evolution of point defects in materials, which are known to play an essential role in passive film formation. The PDM provides a theoretical framework to understand the growth of passive films under fretting corrosion conditions. Using the PDM, it is possible to link the film thickness to the concentration of diffusing species, such as oxygen or chromium.

In this research work, experimental data from fretting corrosion tests were used to validate the PDM predictions. Three different materials were tested: stainless steel, Ti-6Al-4V alloy, and aluminum. The PDM results were compared to the experimental data, and a good agreement was found for all materials tested. The film thickness achieved a steady-state value after a certain time, which was also observed in experiments. The model was further used to investigate the effect of key parameters on the passive film growth, such as the frequency and amplitude of the fretting motion and the solution composition.

Overall, the Point Defect Model presented in this work has proven to be a powerful tool to predict the steady-state thickness of passive films in fretting corrosion experiments. The model provides a theoretical understanding of the mechanisms behind passive film formation and can be used to optimize the conditions for passive film growth and the resulting corrosion resistance. Future work could focus on extending the model to account for more complex corrosion scenarios or to study other materials and conditions in fretting corrosion experiments.","(367, 16)","Some implants have approximately a lifetime of 15 years. The femoral stem, for example, should
have a lifetime of at least 15 years. However, there are many factors that can affect the lifetime
of an implant. One of these factors is fretting corrosion. Fretting corrosion is a type of
corrosion that occurs when two surfaces rub against each other. This can cause the surfaces to
wear down, which can lead to failure of the implant. In order to predict the lifetime of an
implant, it is important to understand how fretting corrosion affects the implant.
The Point Defect Model (PDM) is a mathematical model that can be used to predict the
thickness of a passive film on a metal surface. A passive film is a thin layer of oxide that forms
on the surface of a metal. This layer protects the metal from corrosion. The PDM can be used to
predict the thickness of this layer under different conditions.
In this study, we will use the PDM to predict the thickness of the passive film on a titanium
implant in a fretting corrosion experiment. We will use data from previous experiments to
determine the values of the parameters in the PDM. We will then use these values to predict the
lifetime of the implant.
The results of this study will help to improve the design of implants. By understanding how
fretting corrosion affects the lifetime of an implant, we can design implants that are more
resistant to this type of corrosion. This will help to extend the lifetime of implants and improve
the quality of life for patients.","(294, 17)",,

This work is a positioning research paper for energy efficient building based on ICT solutions.
","This work is a positioning research paper for energy efficient building based on ICT solutions. Through the literature about the solutions for energy control of buildings during operational phase, a 3-layers model is proposed to integrate these solutions: first level consists in communication technologies, second level is about data modelling and third level is related to decision-making tools. For each level, key research topics and remaining problems are identified in order to achieve a concrete step forward. 1. CONTEXT AND PROBLEMATICS Through studies on ICT solutions for energy control of buildings, a 3-layers model is proposed to integrate these solutions and position a new way for energy efficiency. The building sector is the largest user of energy and CO 2 emitter in the EU, estimated at approximately 40% of the total consumption (Sharples et al., 1999). According to the International Panel on Climate Change (European Union, 2010), 30% of energy used in buildings could be reduced with net economic benefits by 2030. Such a reduction, however, is meaningless unless ""sustainability"" is considered. Because of these factors, healthy, sustainable, and energy efficient buildings have become active topics in international research; there is an urgent need for a new kind of high-technology driven and integrative research that should lead to the massive development of smart buildings and, in the medium term, smart cities. From a building lifecycle perspective, most of the energy (~80%) is consumed during the operational stage of the building (European Union, 2010) (Bilsen et al., 2013). Reducing building energy consumption may be addressed by the physical modifications which can be operated on a building like upgrading windows, heating systems or modifying thermic characteristics by insulating. Another possible path to reduce the energy consumption of a building is to use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). According to the International Panel on Climate Change, a reduction of energy even greater than the 30% can be targeted by 2030 by considering ICT solutions. In support of this claim, some specialists believe that ICT-based solutions have the potential to enable 50-80% greenhouse gas reduction globally. In this respect, ICT innovation opens prospects for the development of a new range of new services highly available, flexible, safe, easy to integrate, and user friendly (Bilsen et al., 2013). This, in turn, should foster a sophisticated, reliable and fast communication infrastructure for the connection of various distributed elements (sensors, generators, substations...) that enables to exchange real-time data, information and knowledge needed to improve efficiency (e.g., to monitor and control energy consumption), reliability (e.g., to facilitate maintenance operations), flexibility (e.g., to integrate new rules to meet new consumer expectations), and investment returns, but also to induce a shift in consumer behaviour.","(532, 16)","The building sector is a significant contributor to global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, there has been growing interest in constructing energy-efficient buildings to reduce environmental impacts and also to save energy costs. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) play a vital role in achieving this goal. 

This paper aims to explore the potential of ICTs in making buildings more energy efficient. In particular, we investigate how advances in ICTs have contributed to improving building energy efficiency, and how they can further help in this direction. We begin with an overview of the current state-of-the-art in energy-efficient building design and technologies. Then, we discuss in detail the various ICT-based solutions which have been proposed and implemented with the aim of enhancing energy efficiency in buildings. 

One important area that ICTs can help is in building automation and control systems. These systems can monitor building performance in real-time, optimizing energy consumption and improving occupant comfort. Another area is the use of sensor technologies to collect data on building energy performance. This data can then be analyzed to identify areas where improvements can be made. Moreover, predictive analytics techniques can be employed to forecast energy needs and help optimize energy usage. 

Another promising area where ICTs can help is through the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM). BIM enables designers and engineers to simulate and analyze building performance at the design stage, allowing them to identify and rectify potential energy inefficiencies before construction. Furthermore, once a building is built, BIM can be used to monitor and maintain its performance throughout its lifecycle. 

However, the adoption of ICTs in the building sector faces several challenges, such as lack of interoperability between different systems and solutions, as well as insufficient awareness and understanding among building professionals. Therefore, this paper also discusses the various barriers which need to be overcome to successfully implement ICT-based solutions for energy-efficient buildings. This includes the need for standardization and regulation, as well as education and training of building professionals. 

In conclusion, this paper establishes that the use of ICTs can significantly contribute to achieving energy-efficient buildings. However, it also highlights the challenges and barriers which need to be addressed to ensure successful implementation. We hope that this paper will provide a useful resource for researchers, industry professionals, and policy-makers in the building sector, and encourage further research and development of ICT-based solutions for energy efficiency.","(443, 21)","This work is a positioning research paper for energy efficient building based on ICT solutions.

The paper will also explore some of the challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of ICT in this area, such as the need for standardization and interoperability between different systems.
Finally, the paper will conclude with a summary of the key findings and recommendations for future research.
Energy efficiency has become an increasingly important issue in recent years, as the world grapples with the challenges of climate change and resource scarcity.
Buildings account for a significant portion of global energy consumption, and there is a growing recognition that we need to find ways to reduce this consumption if we are to meet our sustainability goals.
One way to do this is through the use of information and communication technologies (ICT).
ICT can be used to monitor and control energy usage in buildings, and to provide feedback to occupants on their energy consumption habits.
This can help to reduce energy waste and promote more efficient use of resources.
There are a number of different ways that ICT can be deployed in buildings to improve energy efficiency.
One common approach is to install smart meters, which can provide real-time data on energy usage.
This data can then be used to identify areas where energy is being wasted, and to develop strategies for reducing consumption.
Another approach is to use building automation systems, which can automatically adjust the temperature, lighting, and other factors in a building in order to optimize energy usage.
These systems can be programmed to respond to changes in occupancy, weather conditions, or other factors that may affect energy consumption.
Finally, energy management software can be used to track and analyze energy usage data, and to generate reports that can be used to identify opportunities for improvement.
By using ICT in these ways, it is possible to achieve significant reductions in energy consumption in buildings.
However, there are also a number of challenges that must be overcome in order to realize the full potential of ICT for energy efficiency.
One challenge is the lack of standardization between different systems and technologies.

","CODYRUN is a multi-zone software integrating thermal building simulation, airflow, and pollutant transfer. A first question thus arose as to the integration of indoor lighting conditions into the simulation, leading to a new model calculating natural and artificial lighting. The results of this new daylighting module were then compared with results of other simulation codes and experimental cases both in artificial and natural environments. Excellent agreements were obtained, such as the values for luminous efficiencies in a tropical and humid climate. In this paper, a comparison of the model output with detailed measures is presented using a dedicated test cell in Reunion Island (French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean), thus confirming the interest for thermal and daylighting designs in low-energy buildings.

Introduction Several software packages are available for thermal and airflow simulation in buildings. The most frequently used are ENERGY+ [1], ESP-r [2], and TRNSYS [3]. These applications allow an increasing number of models to be integrated, such as airflow, pollutant transport, and daylighting. In the latter category, we may note ENERGY+, ESP-r and ECOTECT [4] software. After more than 20 years of developing a specific code named CODYRUN, we decided to add a lighting module to our software. This paper therefore provides some details on this evolution and elements of validation. The CODYRUN initial software and its validation Developed by the Physics and Mathematical Engineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment at the University of Reunion Island, CODYRUN [5-14] is a multi-zone software program integrating ventilation and moisture transport transfer in buildings. The software employs a zone approach based on nodal analysis and resolves a coupled system describing thermal and airflow phenomena. Numerous validation tests of the CODYRUN code were successfully applied to the software. Apart from the daylighting model, the majority applied the BESTEST procedure [15]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) sponsors a number of programs to improve the use and associated technologies of energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed BESTEST, which is a method based on comparative testing of building simulation programs, on the IEA's behalf. The procedure consists of a series of test cases buildings that are designed to isolate individual aspects of building energy and test the extremes of a program. As the modelling approach is very different between codes, the test cases are specified so that input equivalency can be defined thus allowing the different cases to be modelled by most of codes. The basis for comparison is a range of results from a number of programs considered to be a state-of-art in United States and Europe.

Associated with other specific comparisons, a very confident level of validation was obtained for the CODYRUN initial software [8].","(506, 21)","The application of energy-efficient and sustainable design principles is important for reducing carbon emissions and achieving environmental goals. One important factor that determines the energy efficiency of a building is its daylighting design, which optimizes natural light infiltration to achieve energy savings and improve occupant comfort. However, accurate modeling of daylighting in building simulations is challenging due to the complex interplay between various factors, such as window design, orientation, reflectance, and shading.

In this research, we present a validation study of a daylighting model implemented in the CODYRUN building simulation code. This model is based on the Radiance lighting simulation software, which is widely used in the lighting design industry and has been validated against other research studies. Our goal is to assess the accuracy and reliability of the CODYRUN model for simulating daylighting performance in a range of building types and climate conditions.

To achieve this goal, we conducted a series of validation tests using real-world building data and experimental measurements. We selected three different building prototypes representing a range of typologies and orientations, and we simulated their daylighting performance using the CODYRUN model and a standard Radiance model. We compared the results of the two simulations against measured data from on-site sensors and found that the CODYRUN model achieved a high degree of accuracy in predicting daylighting performance and illuminance levels.

Our results demonstrate that the CODYRUN model is a reliable and accurate tool for simulating daylighting performance in building design. This model can be used to optimize the design of new buildings for energy efficiency and occupant comfort, and to evaluate the retrofitting potential of existing buildings. Moreover, it can be used in conjunction with other building simulation codes to achieve a comprehensive analysis of building performance.

Overall, this research contributes to the validation of a tool that can improve the sustainability and energy efficiency of building design. Further research could focus on developing more advanced and detailed daylighting models for even more sophisticated building simulation analyses.","(357, 14)","CODYRUN is a multi-zone software integrating thermal building simulation, airflow, and pollutant transfer.

daylighting model is carried out by comparing the results of CODYRUN with those of EnergyPlus, which is another

","Distant clumpy galaxies are thought to be Jeans-unstable disks, and an important channel for the formation of local galaxies, as suggested by recent spatially-resolved kinematic observations of z~2 galaxies. I study the kinematics of clumpy galaxies at z~0.6, and compare their properties with those of counterparts at higher and lower redshifts. I selected a sample of 11 clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 from the representative sample of emission line, intermediate-mass galaxies IMAGES. Selection was based on rest-frame UV morphology from HST/ACS images, mimicking the selection criteria commonly used at higher redshifts. Their spatially-resolved kinematics were derived in the frame of the IMAGES survey, using the VLT/FLAMES-GIRAFFE multi-integral field spectrograph. For those showing large-scale rotation, I derived the Toomre Q parameter, which characterizes the stability of their gaseous and stellar phases. I find that the fraction of UV-selected clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 is 20+/-12%. Roughly half of them (45+/-30%) have complex kinematics inconsistent with Jeans-unstable disks, while those in the remaining half (55+/-30%) show large-scale rotations. The latter reveal a stable gaseous phase, but the contribution of their stellar phase makes them globally unstable to clump formation. Clumpy galaxies appear to be less unstable at z~0.6 than at z~2, which could explain why the UV clumps tend to vanish in rest-frame optical images of z~0.6 clumpy galaxies, conversely to z~2 clumpy galaxies, in which the stellar phase can substantially fragment. This suggests that the former correspond to patchy star-formation regions superimposed on a smoother mass distribution. A possible and widespread scenario for driving clump formation relies on instabilities by cold streams penetrating the dark matter halos where clumpy galaxies inhabit. While such a gas accretion process is predicted to be significant in massive, z~2 haloes, it is also predicted to be strongly suppressed in similar, z~0.6 haloes, which could explain why lowest-z clumpy galaxies appear to be driven by a different mechanism. Instead, I found that interactions are probably the dominant driver leading to the formation of clumpy galaxies at z<1. I argue that the nature of z>1 clumpy galaxies remains more uncertain. While cold flows could be an important driver at z~2, I also argue that the observed and cumulative merger fraction between z=2 and z=3 is large enough so that every z~2 galaxy might be the result of a merger that occurred within their past 1 Gyr. I conclude that it is premature to rule out mergers as a universal driver for galaxy evolution from z~2 down to z=0.","(456, 17)","This study examines the properties of clumpy galaxies at z~0.6, focusing on their kinematics, stability, and comparison with analogs at other redshifts. We select a sample of these galaxies using HST/COSMOS imaging and perform a detailed analysis of their internal dynamics using integral field spectroscopy. We find that clumpy galaxies have irregular velocity fields with significant deviations from circular motions, indicative of ongoing gas accretion and/or merger events. Our analysis of the Toomre stability parameter reveals that clumpy galaxies are marginally unstable against axisymmetric modes, with a median Q value of 1.6±0.2. However, when non-axisymmetric modes are taken into account, the stability criterion is more easily satisfied, suggesting that clumps play a crucial role in stabilizing the disks of these galaxies. We compare our results to existing studies of clumpy galaxies at different redshifts and find that kinematic properties and stability conditions of these systems evolve in a complex manner over time. While clumps in local galaxies are often associated with tidally induced star formation in bulge-dominated disks, at higher redshifts they are more commonly found in pure-disk galaxies that are in the process of assembling. Our findings provide further evidence for the importance of clumps in galaxy evolution and suggest that the kinematics and stability of these systems are key indicators of their formation histories. We discuss the implications of our results for galaxy formation and evolution models and highlight the need for more detailed studies of clumpy galaxies at a range of redshifts. We conclude that further progress in our understanding of these systems will require the synergistic use of high-quality multi-wavelength data and state-of-the-art modeling techniques.","(288, 10)","Distant clumpy galaxies are thought to be Jeans-unstable disks, and an important channel for the

galaxies are also unstable at lower redshifts (z < 1). Here, we present a study of the kinematics,
stability, and evolution of clumpy galaxies at z ~ 0.6 using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging
and Keck spectroscopy. We find that clumpy galaxies at this redshift have similar properties to their
analogous counterparts at higher redshifts, including high star formation rates (SFRs), low stellar
masses, and high gas fractions. However, we also find that the kinematics of these galaxies are
significantly different from those of their higher-redshift counterparts. In particular, we find that
the velocity dispersion of the clumps in these galaxies is significantly lower than that of the
surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), indicating that the clumps are likely to be gravitationally
unstable. This suggests that the formation of massive ellipticals in the early universe may be
driven by a combination of gravitational instability and mergers, rather than just gravitational
instability alone. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for our understanding of the

","Aims. Excitation of far-infrared and submillimetric molecular lines may originate from nonreactive collisions, chemical formation, or far infrared, near-infrared, and optical fluorescences. As a template, we investigate the impact of each of these processes on the excitation of the methylidyne cation CH+ and on the intensities of its rotational transitions recently detected in emission in dense photodissociation regions (PDRs) and in planetary nebulae.

Methods. We have developed a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) excitation model that includes the entire energy structure of CH+, i.e. taking into account the pumping of its vibrational and bound and unbound electronic states by near-infrared and optical photons. The model includes the theoretical cross-sections of nonreactive collisions with H, H2, He, and e-, and a Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the probability of populating the excited levels of CH+ during its chemical formation by hydrogenation of C+. To confirm our results we also performed an extensive analytical study, which we use to predict the main excitation process of several diatomic molecules, namely HF, HCl, SiO, CS, and CO. Results. At densities nH = 10^4 cm-3, the excitation of the rotational levels of CH+ is dominated by the radiative pumping of its electronic, vibrational, and rotational states if the intensities of the radiation field at \sim 0.4, \sim 4, and \sim 300 \mum are stronger than 10^5, 10^8, and 10^4 times those of the local interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Below these values, the chemical pumping is the dominant source of excitation of the J > 1 levels, even at high kinetic temperatures (\sim 1000 K). The far-infrared emission lines of CH+ observed in the Orion Bar and the NGC 7027 PDRs are consistent with the predictions of our excitation model assuming an incident far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field of \sim 3 \times 10^4 (in Draine's unit) and densities of \sim 5 \times 10^4 and \sim 2 \times 10^5 cm-3. In the case of NGC 7027, the estimate of the density is 10 to 100 times lower than those deduced by traditional excitation codes.

Applying our model to other X1\Sigma+ ground state diatomic molecules, we find that HF, and SiO and HCl are the species the most sensitive to the radiative pumping of their vibrational and bound electronic states. In both cases, the minimal near-infrared and optical/UV radiation field intensities required to modify their rotational level populations are \sim 10^3 times those of the local ISRF at densities nH = 10^4 cm-3. All these results point towards interstellar and circumstellar media with densities lower than previously established and cast doubts on the clumpiness of well-studied molecular clouds.","(487, 16)","This research paper presents a complete model of the rotational excitation of CH+ that incorporates both radiative and chemical pumping processes. We investigate the physical mechanisms that govern the initial excitation and subsequent de-excitation of this molecule, as well as the role played by the external radiation field. Our model allows us to predict the rotational excitation of the CH+ molecule at different physical conditions and assess the impact of radiative and chemical processes on this excitation. 

We begin by describing the basic properties of CH+ and its spectral features. We then detail the calculation of the radiative and chemical rates that enter our model. The radiative pumping is a result of the interaction between CH+ and the background radiation field, while the chemical pumping arises from reactions of CH+ with other species. The balance between these two processes and their relative importance in different environments is investigated using our model.

Results from our simulations show that both radiative and chemical pumping contribute significantly to the rotational excitation of CH+ at different levels. The balance between these processes is found to depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and gas density, as well as the intensity and spectral distribution of the radiation field. We find that chemical pumping dominates in the low-density regime, while radiation pumping dominates in high-density environments. 

The implications of our study are significant for understanding a range of astrophysical phenomena, where CH+ plays an important role. For example, CH+ has been detected in a variety of interstellar environments, and its rotational excitation is critical for interpreting the observed emission. By providing a complete model that includes both radiative and chemical pumping processes, our study provides new insights into the excitation of CH+ and its role in astrophysical environments.

Overall, this work represents a significant advancement in our understanding of the rotational excitation of CH+ and its dependence on the radiative and chemical pumping processes. Our model provides a useful tool for predicting the excitation of this important molecular ion in various astrophysical environments.","(363, 15)","Aims. Excitation of far-infrared and submillimetric molecular lines may originate from nonreactive collisions, chemical formation,

Methodology. The model is based on the solution of the rate equations for the populations of the rotational levels of CH$^+$,
taking into account collisional, radiative, and chemical pumping processes. The collisional rates are calculated using the
quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method, while the radiative and chemical rates are taken from the literature.
Findings. The model reproduces well the observed CH$^+$ column densities and rotational temperatures in the ISM. It also
predicts the existence of a population inversion between the $J=1$ and $J=2$ levels, which may lead to maser emission.
Implications. The results of this work have important implications for our understanding of the physical and chemical
processes in the ISM, as well as for the interpretation of observations of molecular lines in the far-infrared and

Inquiry: Moreover, static analyses, e.g., complexity metrics, dependency analysis, and declaration-use analysis, are usually domain-dependent and cannot be easily reused. Therefore, transferring existing static analyses to another DSL incurs a huge implementation overhead. However, this overhead is not always intrinsically necessary: in many cases, while the concepts of the DSL on which a static analysis is performed are domain-specific, the underlying algorithm employed in the analysis is actually domain-independent and thus can be reused in principle, depending on how it is specified. While current approaches either implement static analyses internally or with an external Visitor, the implementation is tied to the language's grammar and cannot be reused easily.

Thus far, a commonly used approach that achieves reusable static analysis relies on the transformation into an intermediate representation upon which the analysis is performed. This, however, entails a considerable additional implementation effort.

Approach: To remedy this, it has been proposed to map the necessary domain-specific concepts to the algorithm's domain-independent data structures, yet without a practical implementation and the demonstration of reuse. Thus, to make static analysis reusable again, we employ relational Reference Attribute Grammars (RAGs) by creating such a mapping to a domain-independent overlay structure using higher-order attributes.

Knowledge: We describe how static analysis can be specified on analysis-specific data structures, how relational RAGs can help with the specification, and how a mapping from the domain-specific language can be performed. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a static analysis for a DSL can be externalized and reused in another general purpose language.

Grounding: The approach was evaluated using the RAG system JastAdd. To illustrate reusability, we implemented two analyses with two addressed languages each: a cycle detection analysis used in a small state machine DSL and for detecting circular dependencies in Java types and packages, and an analysis of variable shadowing, applied to both Java and the Modelica modelling language. Thereby, we demonstrate the reuse of two analysis algorithms in three completely different domains. Additionally, we use the cycle detection analysis to evaluate the efficiency by comparing our external analysis to an internal reference implementation analysing all Java programs in the Qualitas Corpus and thereby are able to show that an externalized analysis incurs only minimal overhead.

Importance: We make static analysis reusable, again, showing the practicality and efficiency of externalizing static analysis for both DSLs and general purpose languages using relational RAGs.","(502, 17)","In software engineering, the use of static analysis has become increasingly important for assurance of reliable software systems. However, as the development of domain-specific languages (DSLs) becomes more common, handling their unique syntax and features in static analysis tools has become a challenge. This paper proposes a method for reusing existing static analysis tools across different DSLs by using reference attribute grammars (RAGs). 

RAGs are a powerful grammar formalism that can be used to unify the syntax and semantics of different DSLs by defining them in a single, common tree structure. By leveraging this structure, RAGs enable the reuse of existing static analysis tools across different DSLs. 

The proposed method works by translating the input program in a given DSL to the common tree structure defined by the RAG. This enables the use of existing static analysis tools, which can operate on the common tree structure. The results of the analysis are then translated back into the original DSL syntax. This method has been implemented using the Spoofax language workbench, which allows for efficient implementation of the RAG-based translation process. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied it to several DSLs with different syntax and semantic features, including a DSL for mathematical equations and a DSL for describing control flow. The experimental results demonstrate that the method is effective in enabling the reuse of existing static analysis tools across these different DSLs. 

Additionally, we discuss the limitations of our approach. The proposed approach is dependent on the correctness and completeness of existing static analysis tools for the common tree structure defined by the RAG. Also, the cost of implementing the translation process can be high, especially in cases where the syntax and semantic differences between DSLs are significant. Despite these limitations, we believe that RAG-based translation is a promising direction for enabling the reuse of existing static analysis tools across DSLs. 

In conclusion, this paper proposes a method for reusing existing static analysis tools across different DSLs using RAGs. The method enables the reuse of existing static analysis tools across different DSLs and has been shown to be effective in experimental evaluations. While limitations exist, the proposed method is promising and provides a foundation for future research on the topic.","(410, 18)","Context: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) enable domain experts to specify tasks and problems themselves, while enabling
programmers to implement them. However, reusing static analysis across different DSLs can be challenging due to their
differences in syntax and semantics. Reference attribute grammars (RAGs) provide a solution to this problem by allowing
the reuse of static analysis across multiple DSLs.
Research Question: How can we reuse static analysis across different domain-specific languages using reference attribute
grammars?
Methodology: We propose a novel approach to reusing static analysis based on reference attribute grammars. Our approach
involves defining a reference attribute grammar that captures the commonalities between different DSLs. This reference
attribute grammar can then be used to generate specialized attribute grammars for each DSL, which can be used to perform
static analysis on programs written in that DSL.
Findings: We evaluated our approach by applying it to three different DSLs: a DSL for modeling biological systems, a DSL
for modeling financial systems, and a DSL for modeling software systems. Our results show that our approach is able to
reuse static analysis across all three DSLs, with minimal effort required to adapt the reference attribute grammar to each
DSL.
Implications: Our work has several implications for the field of software engineering. First, it demonstrates that
reference attribute grammars can be used to effectively reuse static analysis across multiple domain-specific languages.
Second, it highlights the importance of capturing commonalities between DSLs in order to enable the reuse of static
analysis. Finally, it suggests that reference attribute grammars may be a promising approach for enabling the reuse of
static analysis in other domains as well.","(299, 13)",,

","Weighted automata are nondeterministic automata with numerical weights on transitions. They can define quantitative languages~$L$ that assign to each word~$w$ a real number~$L(w)$. In the case of infinite words, the value of a run is naturally computed as the maximum, limsup, liminf, limit-average, or discounted-sum of the transition weights. The value of a word $w$ is the supremum of the values of the runs over $w$. We study expressiveness and closure questions about these quantitative languages. We first show that the set of words with value greater than a threshold can be non-$\omega$-regular for deterministic limit-average and discounted-sum automata, while this set is always $\omega$-regular when the threshold is isolated (i.e., some neighborhood around the threshold contains no word). In the latter case, we prove that the $\omega$-regular language is robust against small perturbations of the transition weights. We next consider automata with transition weights Weighted automata are nondeterministic automata with numerical weights ontransitions.

We establish the closure properties of all classes of quantitative languages with respect to these four operations.","(569, 19)","This research paper tackles the topic of expressiveness and closure properties in the domain of quantitative languages. We consider quantitative languages as those where semantics assign to sentences real values which represent the degree to which the sentence holds in a given model. This notion allows us to reason about the degree in which a property holds, instead of just its truth value.

We first focus on the expressive power of quantitative languages and investigate the question of what can be expressed in such languages. For this purpose, we study fragments of quantitative languages and investigate their expressiveness. In particular, we consider fragments with limited use of quantification and fragments with restrictions on the formulas that can be used. We prove that these fragments have different levels of expressiveness and are strictly nested, with each fragment being strictly less expressive than the next one. Moreover, we show that some of these fragments are expressively complete, meaning that any sentence in the full language can be expressed using only formulas from the fragment.

We then shift our focus to closure properties of quantitative languages. Closure properties describe how taking the closure of a set of formulas changes the set. We investigate which closure properties hold for different fragments of quantitative languages. We prove that some of the fragments are closed under taking the inverse, while others are not. Furthermore, we show that no fragment is closed under taking the square root, which is a fundamental operation in many quantitative settings.

Our investigation also includes a study of automata theory for quantitative languages. We prove that the expressive power of the standard automata models is limited, and we propose extensions that allow us to reason about the degree to which a property holds. Finally, we demonstrate that these extensions also yield results for the study of model checking and Synthesis problems.

The results of this paper provide new insights into the study of quantitative languages and their expressive power. Our findings are relevant both for theoretical questions, like the limits of expressiveness and the closure properties of the language, as well as practical questions, like the study of different decision problems in automata-based models.","(394, 18)","Weighted automata are nondeterministic automata with numerical weights on transitions.

perspective of functional acceptances (any run whose weight matches the weight of the word is accepting) and regular acceptances
(any run whose weight is maximal among all runs on $w$ is accepting).
We establish the decidability and undecidability results regarding the closure of weighted automata under the following operations:
union, intersection, complementation, concatenation, Kleene star, and reverse.

Context. Tens of light hydrides and small molecules have now been detected over several hundreds
","Context. Tens of light hydrides and small molecules have now been detected over several hundreds sight lines sampling the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in both the Solar neighbourhood and the inner Galactic disk. They provide unprecedented statistics on the first steps of chemistry in the diffuse gas.

Aims. These new data confirm the limitations of the traditional chemical pathways driven by the UV photons and the cosmic rays (CR) and the need for additional energy sources, such as turbulent dissipation, to open highly endoenergetic formation routes. The goal of the present paper is to further investigate the link between specific species and the properties of the turbulent cascade in particular its space-time intermittency. Methods. We have analysed ten different atomic and molecular species in the framework of the updated model of turbulent dissipation regions (TDR). We study the influence on the abundances of these species of parameters specific to chemistry (density, UV field, and CR ionisation rate) and those linked to turbulence (the average turbulent dissipation rate, the dissipation timescale, and the ion neutral velocity drift in the regions of dissipation). Results. The most sensitive tracers of turbulent dissipation are the abundances of CH+ and SH+, and the column densities of the J = 3, 4, 5 rotational levels of H2 . The abundances of CO, HCO+, and the intensity of the 158 $\mu$m [CII] emission line are significantly enhanced by turbulent dissipation. The vast diversity of chemical pathways allows the independent determinations of free parameters never estimated before: an upper limit to the average turbulent dissipation rate, $\overline{\varepsilon}$ < 10$^{-23}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ for $n_H$=20 cm$^{-3}$, from the CH+ abundance; an upper limit to the ion-neutral velocity drift, $u_{in}$ < 3.5 km s$^{-1}$, from the SH+ to CH+ abundance ratio; and a range of dissipation timescales, 100 < $\tau_V$ < 1000 yr, from the CO to HCO+ abundance ratio. For the first time, we reproduce the large abundances of CO observed on diffuse lines of sight, and we show that CO may be abundant even in regions with UV-shieldings as low as $5 \times 10^{-3}$ mag. The best range of parameters also reproduces the abundance ratios of OH, C2H, and H2O to HCO+ and are consistent with the known properties of the turbulent cascade in the Galactic diffuse ISM. Conclusions. Our results disclose an unexpected link between the dissipation of turbulence and the emergence of molecular richness in the diffuse ISM. Some species, such as CH+ or SH+, turn out to be unique tracers of the energy trail in the ISM. In spite of some degeneracy, the properties of the turbulent cascade, down to dissipation, can be captured through specific molecular abundances.","(555, 19)","The turbulent structures and dynamics of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) have long been the subject of intense scrutiny. Chemical probes can greatly aid our understanding of this area of research, particularly when used in conjunction with numerical simulations that help to reveal the physical processes that drive turbulent motions. In this paper, we present a new theory called the TDR model that provides a powerful framework for interpreting and analyzing chemical data in the diffuse medium. Our approach is based on the idea that turbulent motions lead to significant variations in temperature and density on small scales, which in turn affect the chemical pathways that are responsible for molecular synthesis and destruction. By using a suite of numerical simulations that span a range of conditions commonly found in the ISM, we are able to isolate the key chemical signatures of turbulence that are observable with current observational methods.

The TDR model is based on the assumption that turbulence is a multifaceted phenomenon that involves both the stirring of the interstellar gas and the injection of energy into the medium through a variety of physical mechanisms. To capture these processes, we use a combination of analytical methods and numerical simulations that allow us to study the evolution of chemical species under idealized conditions. Our simulations show that the transport of gas and dust in the ISM is closely linked to the distribution of chemical species, and that the chemical signature of turbulence is driven primarily by the strength of the turbulence in the surrounding medium. We also discuss how our results relate to other recent work on the dynamics and chemistry of the ISM, highlighting some of the key areas where further research is needed.

Overall, our study provides new insights into the complex interplay between turbulent motions and chemical evolution in the diffuse ISM. We show that chemical probes can be highly effective tools for revealing the underlying physics of turbulence, and that the TDR model represents a promising approach to understanding this important area of research. Our results have implications for a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including star formation, cosmic ray acceleration, and the origin of life in the universe. Future observations and numerical simulations will be crucial for fully exploiting the potential of chemical probes in this exciting and rich scientific frontier.","(413, 13)","Context.

of lines of sight in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) (e.g., Gerin et al. 2009; Godard et

product of the densities of its constituent atoms, while the destruction rate is proportional to
the product of the densities of the molecule and its constituent atoms. In the TDR model, the
densities of the constituent atoms are assumed to be constant, while the density of the

We present an experimental and theoretical description of the kinetics of coalescence of two water
","We present an experimental and theoretical description of the kinetics of coalescence of two water drops on a plane solid surface. The case of partial wetting is considered. The drops are in an atmosphere of nitrogen saturated with water where they grow by condensation and eventually touch each other and coalesce. A new convex composite drop is rapidly formed that then exponentially and slowly relaxes to an equilibrium hemispherical cap. The characteristic relaxation time is proportional to the drop radius R * at final equilibrium.

This relaxation time appears to be nearly 10 7 times larger than the bulk capillary relaxation time t b = R * $\eta$/$\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the gas--liquid surface tension and $\eta$ is the liquid shear viscosity. In order to explain this extremely large relaxation time, we consider a model that involves an Arrhenius kinetic factor resulting from a liquid--vapour phase change in the vicinity of the contact line. The model results in a large relaxation time of order t b exp(L/RT) where L is the molar latent heat of vaporization, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. We model the late time relaxation for a near spherical cap and find an exponential relaxation whose typical time scale agrees reasonably well with the experiment. 1.

Introduction Fusion or coalescence between drops is a key process in a wide range of phenomena: phase transition in fluids and liquid mixtures or polymers, stability of foams and emulsions, and sintering in metallurgy (Eggers 1998), which is why the problem of coalescence has already received considerable attention. Most of the studies of this process so far have been devoted to the coalescence of two spherical drops floating in a medium. The kinetics of the process before and after the drops have touched each other is governed by the hydrodynamics inside and outside the drops and by the van der Waals forces when the drops are within mesoscopic distance from each other (Yiantsios \& Davis 1991). The composite drop that results from the coalescence of two drops relaxes to a spherical shape within a time which is dominated by the relaxation of the flow inside and outside (Nikolayev, Beysens \& Guenoun 1996; Nikolayev \& Beysens 1997). There are no studies, to our knowledge, of the coalescence of two sessile drops after they touch each other. In this paper, we report a preliminary study of the dynamics and morphology of this process, in the case of hemispherical water droplets which grow slowly on a plane surface at the expense of the surrounding atmosphere, forming what is called 'dew' or 'breath figures' (Beysens et al. 1991; Beysens 1995). The drops eventually touch each other and coalesce to form an elongated composite","(514, 18)","The coalescence of sessile drops has been a focus of recent research due to its practical applications in various industries. Understanding the mechanics of coalescence is essential to designing surfaces with particular wetting properties and for controlling droplet formation and dynamics.

In general, coalescence refers to the process whereby two or more drops combine to form a single drop. Sessile drops, in particular, are drops that are stationary on a surface, as opposed to sliding or rolling. The coalescence of sessile drops occurs when two or more such drops come into contact on a surface, and the forces acting on the drops cause them to merge.

The factors influencing the coalescence of sessile drops are complex and dependent on a range of parameters, including surface topography, intermolecular forces, and drop size. A key parameter is the contact angle, which is the angle between the drop and the surface it is resting on. The contact angle is determined by the relative magnitudes of the various forces acting on the drop, including cohesion, adhesion, and gravitational forces.

Recent research has focused on developing a detailed understanding of the factors influencing coalescence and the dynamics of the process. Experimental techniques, including high-speed imaging and atomic force microscopy, have been employed to investigate the time-dependent behavior of coalescing sessile drops.

One area of particular interest is the effect of surface patterning on coalescence dynamics. For example, micro and nanoscale patterns have been shown to modify the wetting properties of surfaces, leading to changes in the contact angle and coalescence behavior.

Overall, the coalescence of sessile drops is a complex process with significant practical applications. Recent research has improved our understanding of the underlying mechanics and has opened up new possibilities for designing and engineering surfaces with tailored properties. Further work in this area is necessary to fully comprehend the dynamics of coalescence and to develop novel approaches to surface engineering.","(348, 15)","We present an experimental and theoretical description of the kinetics of coalescence of two water
droplets on a hydrophobic surface. We find that the rate of coalescence depends on the contact angle
between the droplets and the surface, as well as on the size of the droplets. We also find that the
rate of coalescence is faster when the droplets are in contact with each other than when they are
separated by a thin layer of air. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the design
of microfluidic devices.","(97, 4)",,

","A central question in routing games has been to establish conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibrium, either in terms of network topology or in terms of costs. This question is well understood in two classes of routing games. The first is the non-atomic routing introduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of road traffic in which each player (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car has a negligible impact on the congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its expected delay. Under arbitrary topology, such games are known to have a convex potential and thus a unique equilibrium. The second framework is splitable atomic games: there are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a population of individuals (let them be cars in road traffic or packets in the communication networks). In this paper, we study two other frameworks of routing games in which each of several players has an integer number of connections (which are population of packets) to route and where there is a constraint that a connection cannot be split. Through a particular game with a simple three link topology, we identify various novel and surprising properties of games within these frameworks. We show in particular that equilibria are non unique even in the potential game setting of Rosenthal with strictly convex link costs. We further show that non-symmetric equilibria arise in symmetric networks. I. INTRODUCTION A central question in routing games has been to establish conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibria, either in terms of the network topology or in terms of the costs. A survey on these issues is given in [1]. The question of uniqueness of equilibria has been studied in two different frameworks. The first, which we call F1, is the non-atomic routing introduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of road traffic in which each player (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car has a negligible impact on the congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its expected delay. Under arbitrary topology, such games are known to have a convex potential and thus have a unique equilibrium [2]. The second framework, denoted by F2, is splitable atomic games. There are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a population of individuals. This type of games have already been studied in the context of road traffic by Haurie and Marcotte [3] but have become central in the telecom community to model routing decisions of Internet Service Providers that can decide how to split the traffic of their subscribers among various routes so as to minimize network congestion [4]. In this paper we study properties of equilibria in two other frameworks of routing games which exhibit surprising","(499, 21)","Load balancing congestion games are a class of games, played on a network, where each player chooses a path through the network in order to reach a destination node, subject to constraints on the amount of traffic that can flow along each edge. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of these games as the number of players goes to infinity, a regime that is of significant interest in the area of algorithmic game theory.

Our main focus is on the emergence of path congestion in these games, which arises when many players choose to use the same path through the network, leading to a drastic increase in the travel times along that path. We identify a phase transition in the behavior of the system as the number of players grows, where below a certain threshold the network remains uncongested, while above this threshold we observe a sharp increase in path congestion.

We also prove several results related to the stability and equilibria of load balancing congestion games. We show that for certain classes of networks, the games behave in a highly stable manner, with very little fluctuation in the traffic patterns even as the number of players grows large. We also establish the existence of pure Nash equilibria for these games for a range of network topologies, providing insights into the strategic behavior of players in these situations.

Finally, we examine the implications of these results for the design of distributed systems that make use of load balancing algorithms. In particular, we show that by fine-tuning the parameters of these algorithms, it is possible to achieve a desirable trade-off between the efficiency of the system and the amount of congestion that arises when many users are simultaneously accessing the system. These insights will be valuable for the design of large-scale distributed systems in a variety of contexts, from peer-to-peer file sharing networks to cloud computing platforms.

Overall, our work sheds light on the complex dynamics that arise in load balancing congestion games and provides a foundation for investigating these phenomena in a variety of settings. By understanding the asymptotic behavior of these games, we can develop more efficient and robust algorithms for managing traffic flows in large-scale networks.","(396, 12)","A central question in routing games has been to establish conditions for the uniqueness of
Nash equilibria. In this paper, we study load balancing congestion games (LBCGs), a class of
routing games in which each player chooses a path from a source to a destination among a
finite set of paths. We show that LBCGs have a unique Nash equilibrium if and only if they
satisfy the following two conditions: (1) there is a unique shortest path between each pair of
source-destination nodes, and (2) the cost of each path is equal to the sum of the costs of its
edges. We also show that the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium in LBCGs is equivalent
to the existence of a potential function. Finally, we study the asymptotic behavior of Nash
equilibria in LBCGs as the number of players tends to infinity. We show that, under certain
conditions, the limit of the sequence of Nash equilibria converges to a unique Nash equilibrium
of the LBCG with an infinite number of players. This result has important implications for the
design of routing algorithms in large-scale networks.","(205, 7)",,

This paper demonstrates the usefulness of distributed local verification of proofs, as a tool for
","This paper demonstrates the usefulness of distributed local verification of proofs, as a tool for the design of self-stabilizing algorithms.In particular, it introduces a somewhat generalized notion of distributed local proofs, and utilizes it for improving the time complexity significantly, while maintaining space optimality. As a result, we show that optimizing the memory size carries at most a small cost in terms of time, in the context of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). That is, we present algorithms that are both time and space efficient for both constructing an MST and for verifying it.This involves several parts that may be considered contributions in themselves.First, we generalize the notion of local proofs, trading off the time complexity for memory efficiency.

This adds a dimension to the study of distributed local proofs, which has been gaining attention recently. Specifically, we design a (self-stabilizing) proof labeling scheme which is memory optimal (i.e., $O(\log n)$ bits per node), and whose time complexity is $O(\log ^2 n)$ in synchronous networks, or $O(\Delta \log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of nodes. This answers an open problem posed by Awerbuch and Varghese (FOCS 1991).

We also show that $\Omega(\log n)$ time is necessary, even in synchronous networks. Another property is that if $f$ faults occurred, then, within the requireddetection time above, they are detected by some node in the $O(f\log n)$ locality of each of the faults.Second, we show how to enhance a known transformer that makes input/output algorithms self-stabilizing. It now takes as input an efficient construction algorithm and an efficient self-stabilizing proof labeling scheme, and produces an efficient self-stabilizing algorithm.

When used for MST, the transformer produces a memory optimal self-stabilizing algorithm, whose time complexity, namely, $O(n)$, is significantly better even than that of previous algorithms. (The time complexity of previous MST algorithms that used $\Omega(\log^2 n)$ memory bits per node was $O(n^2)$, and the time for optimal space algorithms was $O(n|E|)$.) Inherited from our proof labelling scheme, our self-stabilising MST construction algorithm also has the following two properties: (1) if faults occur after the construction ended, then they are detected by some nodes within $O(\log ^2 n)$ time in synchronous networks, or within $O(\Delta \log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, and (2) if $f$ faults occurred, then, within the required detection time above, they are detected within the $O(f\log n)$ locality of each of the faults. We also show how to improve the above two properties, at the expense of some increase in the memory.","(547, 13)","This paper presents a novel approach for fast and compact self-stabilizing verification, computation, and fault detection of a minimum spanning tree (MST) in a distributed network. Our proposed algorithm guarantees that the network converges to an MST in a self-stabilizing manner, even under arbitrary node and link failures. Furthermore, our algorithm requires only a constant amount of memory at each node, making it highly scalable.

Our approach builds on the concept of self-stabilization, which enables a system to recover from any initial state to a correct state without any external intervention. To achieve self-stabilization in the context of an MST, we propose a distributed algorithm that utilizes a small set of local rules to ensure that each node maintains a consistent view of the network. Moreover, our algorithm relies on the notion of local computation, which enables each node to compute its next state based solely on its local information.

To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a series of simulations on various network topologies. Our results indicate that our algorithm exhibits fast and robust convergence to an MST, even under high network load and node churn. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits fault-tolerance, ensuring that the network remains stable even in the presence of faults.

In addition to its practical applications for distributed systems, our algorithm has theoretical implications for the field of self-stabilization. By demonstrating the feasibility of achieving self-stabilization in a distributed network with a constant amount of memory per node, our algorithm represents a significant advancement in the development of self-stabilizing algorithms.

In conclusion, our approach presents a practical and elegant solution for fast and compact self-stabilizing verification, computation, and fault detection of an MST in a distributed network.

This paper is concerned with a complete asymptoticanalysis as $\mathfrak{E} \to 0$ of the stationary
","This paper is concerned with a complete asymptoticanalysis as $\mathfrak{E} \to 0$ of the stationary Munk equation $\partial\_x\psi-\mathfrak{E} \Delta^2 \psi=\tau$ in a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbf{R}^2$, supplemented with boundaryconditions for $\psi $ and $\partial\_n \psi$. This equation is a simplemodel for the circulation of currents in closed basins, the variables$x$ and $y$ being respectively the longitude and the latitude. A crudeanalysis shows that as $\mathfrak{E} \to 0$, the weak limit of $\psi$ satisfiesthe so-called Sverdrup transport equation inside the domain, namely$\partial\_x \psi^0=\tau$, while boundary layers appear in the vicinity ofthe boundary.These boundary layers, which are the main center of interest of thepresent paper, exhibit several types of peculiar behaviour. First, thesize of the boundary layer on the western and eastern boundary, whichhad already been computed by several authors, becomes formally verylarge as one approaches northern and southern portions of the boudary,i.e. pieces of the boundary on which the normal is vertical. Thisphenomenon is known as geostrophic degeneracy. In order to avoid suchsingular behaviour, previous studies imposed restrictive assumptionson the domain $\Omega$ and on the forcing term $\tau$. Here, we provethat a superposition of two boundary layers occurs in the vicinity ofsuch points: the classical western or eastern boundary layers, andsome northern or southern boundary layers, whose mathematicalderivation is completely new. The size of northern/southern boundarylayers is much larger than the one of western boundary layers($\mathfrak{E}^{1/4}$ vs. $\mathfrak{E}^{1/3}$). We explain in detail how the superpositiontakes place, depending on the geometry of the boundary.Moreover, when the domain $\Omega$ is not connex in the $x$ direction,$\psi^0$ is not continuous in $\Omega$, and singular layers appear inorder to correct its discontinuities. These singular layers areconcentrated in the vicinity of horizontal lines, and thereforepenetrate the interior of the domain $\Omega$. Hence we exhibit some kindof boundary layer separation.

However, we emphasize that we remainable to prove a convergence theorem, so that the singular layerssomehow remain stable, in spite of the separation.Eventually, the effect of boundary layers is non-local in severalaspects. On the first hand, for algebraic reasons, the boundary layerequation is radically different on the west and east parts of theboundary.

As a consequence, the Sverdrup equation is endowed with aDirichlet condition on the East boundary, and no condition on the Westboundary. Therefore western and eastern boundary layers have in factan influence on the whole domain $\Omega$, and not only near theboundary. On the second hand, the northern and southern boundary layerprofiles obey a propagation equation, where the space variable $x$plays the role of time, and are therefore not local.","(540, 17)","The oceanic circulation is a complex system involving a number of physical processes that operate on a vast range of spatial and temporal scales. In many cases, these processes are strongly influenced by the presence of boundaries, such as coastlines or oceanic ridges, which can give rise to boundary layers that have a significant impact on the overall circulation pattern. In this paper, we present a mathematical study of one particular type of boundary layer: the degenerate boundary layer that occurs in large-scale ocean circulation problems.

The degenerate boundary layer arises when the thickness of the boundary layer becomes comparable to the characteristic length scales of the problem. In the context of large-scale ocean circulation, this can occur in regions where the Coriolis force is weak or vanishes, such as the equatorial regions or certain parts of the Southern Ocean. Under such conditions, the momentum equations that govern the flow exhibit a singular behavior, with the boundary layer becoming extremely thin and the velocity gradients becoming very large.

Our study focuses on the mathematical analysis of these degenerate boundary layers and their role in large-scale ocean circulation. We begin by deriving a set of simplified equations that capture the essential features of the degenerate boundary layer, including the dominance of advection over diffusion and the presence of strong lateral shear. We then carry out a detailed analysis of these simplified equations, using both analytical and numerical methods to investigate the behavior of the flow.

Our results show that the presence of degenerate boundary layers can have a significant impact on the overall circulation pattern in large-scale ocean systems. In particular, we find that the boundary layers can give rise to highly localized eddies and jets that are not captured by traditional models of the oceanic circulation. These features have important implications for a wide range of processes, including the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients, as well as the distribution of marine organisms.

Overall, our study highlights the important role played by degenerate boundary layers in large-scale ocean circulation problems and underscores the need for more accurate and detailed models to capture their behavior. Our results provide a foundation for further research in this area and have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of the global ocean system.","(411, 14)","This paper is concerned with a complete asymptoticanalysis as $\mathfrak{E} \to 0$ of the stationary
Navier-Stokes equations in a bounded domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$
with a degenerate boundary layer on a part of the boundary $\partial \mathcal{D}$.
We are interested in the case when the boundary layer is located on a
part of the boundary where the normal component of the velocity vanishes,
and the tangential component of the velocity tends to a non-zero constant
as the distance from the boundary tends to zero. We assume that the
tangential component of the external force also tends to a constant as
the distance from the boundary goes to zero, and the normal component
of the external force tends to zero. Under these assumptions we prove
that there exists a unique solution of the stationary Navier-Stokes
equations which converges to a solution of the Prandtl equations as
$\mathfrak{e} \to 1$. Moreover, we prove that the solution of the
stationary Navier-Stokes equations converges uniformly to the solution
of the Prandtl equation in the norm of the Sobolev space $W^{1,2}(\mathcal{D})$.
We also prove that the rate of convergence is independent of the size of
the boundary layer. The proof is based on the method of matched asymptotic

Starting from a simple animal-biology example, a general, somewhat counter-intuitive property of diffusion random walks
","Starting from a simple animal-biology example, a general, somewhat counter-intuitive property of diffusion random walks is presented. It is shown that for any (non-homogeneous) purely diffusing system, under any isotropic uniform incidence, the average length of trajectories through the system (the average length of the random walk trajecto-ries from entry point to first exit point) is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion process and therefore depends only on the geometry of the system. This exact invariance property may be seen as a generalization to diffusion of the well known mean-chord-length property [1], leading to broad physics and biology applications. Let us first consider a practical animal-biology example that was at the origin of the theoretical work reported hereafter. It is well established, for diverse species, that the spontaneous displacement of insects such as ants, on an horizontal planar surface, may be accurately mod-eled as a constant-speed diffusion random-walk [2-4]. We assume that a circle of radius R is drawn on the surface and we measure the average time that ants spend inside the circle when they enter it (see Fig. 1). The last assumption is that measurements are performed a long time after ants were dropped on the surface, so that the memory of their initial position is lost : this is enough to ensure that no specific direction is favored and therefore that when ants encounter the circle, their incident directions are distributed isotropically. Simple Monte Carlo simulations of such experiments (see Fig. 2) indicate without any doubt that the average encounter time (time between entry into the circle and first exit), for a fixed velocity, depends only of the circle radius. It is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion walk : the mean free path $\lambda$ (average distance between two scattering events, i.e. between two direction-changes), and the single-scattering phase function p(u s , u i) (probability density function of the scattering direction u s for an incident direction u i). Furthermore, this average time scales as R/v, which means that the average trajectory-length < L > scales as R. The average trajectory-length would therefore be the same for different experiments with any insect species-or for any type of diffusive corpuscular motion. There are two reasons why this observation may initially sound counter-intuitive. The first reason is that the average length of diffusion trajectories between two points is known to scale approximately as d 2 /$\lambda$ where d is the distance between the two points (1). For shorter mean (1)This scaling would be exact for an infinite domain in the limit d >> $\lambda$ [5] c EDP Sciences","(500, 16)","Diffusive random walks have been extensively studied due to their usefulness in modeling various physical and biological phenomena. In this paper, we investigate an important invariance property of diffusive random walks that has so far been overlooked in the literature.

Specifically, we show that under certain conditions, the expected value of the square displacement of a particle undergoing a diffusive random walk remains invariant over time. This means that the average distance covered by the particle scales linearly with time, regardless of the underlying dynamics of the system.

We demonstrate this property both analytically and numerically, and provide a thorough discussion of its implications for various applications. In particular, we show that this invariance property has important consequences for the interpretation of experimental data in the field of diffusion processes.

Furthermore, we extend our analysis to encompass more general diffusive processes, such as the fractional Brownian motion. We find that the invariance property holds even in these more complex scenarios, and discuss how this result can be used to improve our understanding of the underlying physics.

Overall, our results provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental properties of diffusive random walks and their implications for various applications. Our findings have important implications for fields ranging from physics and chemistry to biology and ecology, and we believe that they will be useful for researchers working in these areas.","(248, 10)","Starting from a simple animal-biology example, a general, somewhat counter-intuitive property of diffusion random walks
has been discovered. This property has been shown to apply to a wide range of physical systems, including quantum
mechanics, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics. In this paper, we present a rigorous mathematical proof of this
invariance property, and discuss its implications for our understanding of diffusion random walks.
Diffusion random walks are a class of stochastic processes that describe the motion of particles in a random
environment. They are widely used in physics, chemistry, biology, and other fields to model the behavior of
particles under the influence of random forces. The simplest example of a diffusion random walk is the Brownian
motion of a small particle suspended in a fluid. In this case, the particle moves randomly due to collisions with
molecules in the fluid, and its motion can be described by a stochastic differential equation.
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the properties of diffusion random walks. One of the most
interesting properties is the invariance property, which states that the probability distribution of the particle's
position at any given time is independent of the initial position of the particle. This means that, regardless of
where the particle starts, it will have the same probability of being at any given position after a certain amount of
time has passed. This property is counter-intuitive, as one might expect the particle's position to depend on its
initial position. However, it has been shown to hold for a wide range of diffusion random walks, including those
with non-trivial initial conditions.
The invariance property has important implications for the study of diffusion random walks and their applications.
For example, it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of particles without having to know their initial
positions. This is particularly useful in situations where the initial positions of the particles are unknown or
difficult to measure. The invariance property also helps us to understand the underlying mechanisms of diffusion
random walks, and to develop new methods for analyzing and simulating these processes.
In this paper, we provide a rigorous proof of the invarianceproperty for diffusion random walks. Our proof is based
on a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, and it builds on previous work in the field. We also
discuss some of the implications of this property for the modeling and simulation of diffusion random walks,
including the development of new algorithms and the design of more efficient numerical methods.

Our aim is to observationally investigate the cosmic Dark Ages in order to constrain star
","Our aim is to observationally investigate the cosmic Dark Ages in order to constrain star and structure formation models, as well as the chemical evolution in the early Universe. Spectral lines from atoms and molecules in primordial perturbations at high redshifts can give information about the conditions in the early universe before and during the formation of the first stars in addition to the epoch of reionisation. The lines may arise from moving primordial perturbations before the formation of the first stars (resonant scattering lines), or could be thermal absorption or emission lines at lower redshifts. The difficulties in these searches are that the source redshift and evolutionary state, as well as molecular species and transition are unknown, which implies that an observed line can fall within a wide range of frequencies. The lines are also expected to be very weak. Observations from space have the advantages of stability and the lack of atmospheric features which is important in such observations. We have therefore, as a first step in our searches, used the Odin satellite to perform two sets of spectral line surveys towards several positions. The first survey covered the band 547-578 GHz towards two positions, and the second one covered the bands 542.0-547.5 GHz and 486.5-492.0 GHz towards six positions selected to test different sizes of the primordial clouds. Two deep searches centred at 543.250 and 543.100 GHz with 1 GHz bandwidth were also performed towards one position. The two lowest rotational transitions of H2 will be redshifted to these frequencies from z~20-30, which is the predicted epoch of the first star formation. No lines are detected at an rms level of 14-90 and 5-35 mK for the two surveys, respectively, and 2-7 mK in the deep searches with a channel spacing of 1-16 MHz. The broad bandwidth covered allows a wide range of redshifts to be explored for a number of atomic and molecular species and transitions. From the theoretical side, our sensitivity analysis show that the largest possible amplitudes of the resonant lines are about 1 mK at frequencies <200 GHz, and a few micro K around 500-600 GHz, assuming optically thick lines and no beam-dilution. However, if existing, thermal absorption lines have the potential to be orders of magnitude stronger than the resonant lines. We make a simple estimation of the sizes and masses of the primordial perturbations at their turn-around epochs, which previously has been identified as the most favourable epoch for a detection. This work may be considered as an important pilot study for our forthcoming observations with the Herschel Space Observatory.","(464, 16)","The Dark Ages are one of the most interesting epochs in cosmic history, characterized by the universe being immersed in a pervasive fog of cold hydrogen gas. During this era, stars were just beginning to shine and light up the universe. It is assumed that this time period hosted the first generation of stars and galaxies whose birth could act as a beacon for future astronomers to discover. However, the universe's very first light is yet to be detected.

This research paper describes the first spectral line surveys, conducted to search for signals from the Dark Ages. Spectral line surveys are used to reveal redshifted 21cm emission from hydrogen gas in the early universe, which enables scientists to probe the cosmic dawn in detail. The surveys use radio telescopes, which are tailored to capture the remarkably weak signals from hydrogen gas. During the Dark Ages, hydrogen gas was the dominant matter component, thereby providing the ultimate chance for scientists to observe the first light.

The data collected from the spectral line surveys have opened up doors for new discoveries, revealing the early universe's evolution. The surveys have produced valuable insights into the early star formation processes, the formation of the first galaxies, the evolution of black holes, and galaxy clusters' birth. The observations have also enabled astronomers to explore the epoch of reionization, the point in time when stars and galaxies ionized the neutral hydrogen in the universe, leading to the formation of the first luminous objects in the cosmos.

The first spectral line surveys have provided some of the most exciting discoveries in the field of astronomy. The surveys' results have revealed a universe filled with dramatic processes, including supernovae, black hole explosions, and massive galaxy mergers. Radio telescopes have provided the ultimate tool for exploring the cosmos, allowing the observer to dial back the clock to the earliest parts of cosmic history and see the birth of the universe. 

In summary, the first spectral line surveys represent a significant leap in our quest to uncover the mysteries of the cosmic dawn. They have allowed astronomers to explore the earliest and most mysterious periods in cosmic history, revealing insights into the universe's formation processes and evolution. As new techniques and technology continue to emerge, scientists can continue to probe the Dark Ages and further unravel the universe's mysteries.","(433, 17)","Our aim is to observationally investigate the cosmic Dark Ages in order to constrain star

Physical phenomena are observed in many fields (sciences and engineering) and are often studied by
","Physical phenomena are observed in many fields (sciences and engineering) and are often studied by time-consuming computer codes. These codes are analyzed with statistical models, often called emulators. In many situations, the physical system (computer model output) may be known to satisfy inequality constraints with respect to some or all input variables. Our aim is to build a model capable of incorporating both data interpolation and inequality constraints into a Gaussian process emulator. By using a functional decomposition, we propose to approximate the original Gaussian process by a finite-dimensional Gaussian process such that all conditional simulations satisfy the inequality constraints in the whole domain. The mean, mode (maximum a posteriori) and prediction intervals (uncertainty quantification) of the conditional Gaussian process are calculated. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, some conditional simulations with inequality constraints such as boundary, monotonicity or convexity conditions are given. 1.

Introduction. In the engineering activity, runs of a computer code can be expensive and time-consuming. One solution is to use a statistical surrogate for conditioning computer model outputs at some input locations (design points). Gaussian process (GP) emulator is one of the most popular choices [23]. The reason comes from the property of the GP that uncertainty quantification can be calculated. Furthermore, it has several nice properties.

For example, the conditional GP at observation data (linear equality constraints) is still a GP [5]. Additionally, some inequality constraints (such as monotonicity and convexity) of output computer responses are related to partial derivatives. In such cases, the partial derivatives of the GP are also GPs. Incorporating an infinite number of linear inequality constraints into a GP emulator, the problem becomes more difficult. The reason is that the resulting conditional process is not a GP. In the literature of interpolation with inequality constraints, we find two types of meth-ods. The first one is deterministic and based on splines, which have the advantage that the inequality constraints are satisfied in the whole input domain (see e.g. [16], [24] and [25]). The second one is based on the simulation of the conditional GP by using the subdivision of the input set (see e.g. [1], [6] and [11]). In that case, the inequality constraints are satisfied in a finite number of input locations. Notice that the advantage of such method is that un-certainty quantification can be calculated. In previous work, some methodologies have been based on the knowledge of the derivatives of the GP at some input locations ([11], [21] and [26]). For monotonicity constraints with noisy data, a Bayesian approach was developed in [21]. In [11] the problem is to build a GP emulator by using the prior monotonicity","(536, 29)","In many fields of science and engineering, computer simulations or experiments of physical systems are often used to model complex real-world phenomena. However, simulating such systems can be computationally expensive, and conducting physical experiments can be time-consuming and costly. Gaussian process emulators provide a useful alternative by allowing researchers to create computationally efficient surrogate models that can accurately approximate the output of computer experiments.

In this paper, we explore the use of Gaussian process emulators for computer experiments with inequality constraints. Traditional Gaussian processes are unable to handle problems with inequality constraints, making it challenging to build accurate emulators for complex systems with these constraints. Our proposed approach allows for the incorporation of these constraints into the emulator, ensuring that the resulting model is both accurate and consistent with the constraints of the original system.

To illustrate the efficacy of our approach, we present several case studies in which we apply our Gaussian process emulator with inequality constraints to various computer experiments. Our method is compared to other popular surrogate modeling techniques, including polynomial chaos expansions and support vector regression. We demonstrate that our emulator consistently outperforms these methods, particularly when applied to systems with inequality constraints.

One key advantage of our approach is that it provides a flexible framework for handling uncertain input parameters and input/output noise. We incorporate a Bayesian framework to account for these uncertainties, allowing for probabilistic predictions and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, our method seamlessly handles larger and higher-dimensional datasets and can scale up to handle more complex systems.

Overall, our Gaussian process emulator with inequality constraints provides a valuable tool for the modeling of complex systems with computational or experimental constraints. Our approach is flexible, accurate, and computationally efficient, making it a promising surrogate modeling technique for a wide range of fields, including engineering, physics, and environmental science.","(335, 14)","Physical phenomena are observed in many fields (sciences and engineering) and are often studied by
conducting experiments. However, it is not always possible to conduct physical experiments due to
cost, time, or safety concerns. In such cases, computer experiments can be used as an alternative to
physical experiments. A computer experiment is a simulation of a physical experiment using a
computer model. The goal of a computer experiment is to predict the behavior of a physical system
based on the results of the computer simulation.
One of the challenges in conducting computer experiments is dealing with inequality constraints. An
inequality constraint is a restriction on the values that a variable can take. For example, a variable
may be constrained to be positive or negative. Inequality constraints can be difficult to deal with in
computer experiments because they can lead to non-convex optimization problems.
In this paper, we propose a new method for dealing with inequality constraints in computer
experiments. Our method is based on Gaussian process emulators. A Gaussian process emulator is a
statistical model that can be used to predict the output of a computer experiment based on the
results of previous experiments. We show that our method can be used to accurately predict the
behavior of a physical system even when there are inequality constraints.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to a computer experiment that
models the flow of a fluid through a pipe. We compare our method to other methods for dealing with
inequality constraints in computer experiments and show that our method outperforms the other
methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
We believe that our method has the potential to revolutionize the way computer experiments are
conducted in many fields. Our method is easy to use and can be applied to a wide range of problems.
We hope that our work will inspire others to develop new methods for dealing with inequality
constraints in computer experiments.","(353, 18)",,

The asymptotic concentration of the Fr{\'e}chet mean of IID random variables on a Rieman-nian manifold
","The asymptotic concentration of the Fr{\'e}chet mean of IID random variables on a Rieman-nian manifold was established with a central limit theorem by Bhattacharya \& Patrangenaru (BP-CLT) [6]. This asymptotic result shows that the Fr{\'e}chet mean behaves almost as the usual Euclidean case for sufficiently concentrated distributions. However, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the empirical mean is modified by the expected Hessian of the squared distance. This Hessian matrix was explicitly computed in [5] for constant curvature spaces in order to relate it to the sectional curvature. Although explicit, the formula remains quite difficult to interpret, and the intuitive effect of the curvature on the asymptotic convergence remains unclear.

Moreover, we are most often interested in the mean of a finite sample of small size in practice. In this work, we aim at understanding the effect of the manifold curvature in this small sample regime. Last but not least, one would like computable and interpretable approximations that can be extended from the empirical Fr{\'e}chet mean in Rie-mannian manifolds to the empirical exponential barycenters in affine connection manifolds. For distributions that are highly concentrated around their mean, and for any finite number of samples, we establish explicit Taylor expansions on the first and second moment of the empirical mean thanks to a new Taylor expansion of the Riemannian log-map in affine connection spaces. This shows that the empirical mean has a bias in 1/n proportional to the gradient of the curvature tensor contracted twice with the covariance matrix, and a modulation of the convergence rate of the covariance matrix proportional to the covariance-curvature tensor. We show that our non-asymptotic high concentration expansion is consistent with the asymptotic expansion of the BP-CLT. Experiments on constant curvature spaces demonstrate that both expansions are very accurate in their domain of validity.

Moreover, the modulation of the convergence rate of the empirical mean's covariance matrix is explicitly encoded using a scalar multiplicative factor that gives an intuitive vision of the impact of the curvature: the variance of the empirical mean decreases faster than in the Euclidean case in negatively curved space forms, with an infinite speed for an infinite negative curvature.

This suggests potential links with the stickiness of the Fr{\'e}chet mean described in stratified spaces. On the contrary, the variance of the empirical mean decreases more slowly than in the Euclidean case in positive curvature space forms, with divergence when we approach the limits of the Karcher \& Kendall concentration conditions with a uniform distribution on the equator of the sphere, for which the Fr{\'e}chet mean is not a single point any more.","(498, 15)","This paper examines the effect of curvature on the empirical mean in both Riemannian and affine manifolds. Our focus is on developing a non-asymptotic high concentration expansion in the small-sample regime, which has not been explored in previous studies. We derive sharp concentration inequalities for the empirical mean in the presence of curvature, and establish conditions under which curvature has a significant impact on the mean. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations, which demonstrate that the high concentration expansion provides accurate estimates of the mean even in low-dimensional manifolds and small sample sizes. Furthermore, we establish the optimality of our theoretical results in terms of the scaling of sample sizes and the dependence on curvature. Lastly, we apply our results to a few examples, including the estimation of means on the sphere and the Stiefel manifold. Our findings show the importance of considering curvature effects in manifold learning and optimization algorithms, and shed light on the interplay between geometry and statistics in high-dimensional data analysis. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for studying the effect of curvature on the empirical mean, and lays the groundwork for future research in this area. Future work may explore the impact of curvature on other statistical measures, such as covariance matrices, and may also consider weaker conditions on the curvature than the ones used in our analysis. Overall, our results provide a novel perspective on curvature effects in manifold learning and offer new insights into the connection between geometry and statistics in high-dimensional data analysis.","(274, 10)","The asymptotic concentration of the Fr{\'e}chet mean of IID random variables on a Rieman-nian manifold

The first chapter concerns monotype population models. We first study general birth and death processes
","The first chapter concerns monotype population models. We first study general birth and death processes and we give non-explosion and extinction criteria, moment computations and a pathwise representation. We then show how different scales may lead to different qualitative approximations, either ODEs or SDEs.

The prototypes of these equations are the logistic (deterministic) equation and the logistic Feller diffusion process. The convergence in law of the sequence of processes is proved by tightness-uniqueness argument. In these large population approximations, the competition between individuals leads to nonlinear drift terms. We then focus on models without interaction but including exceptional events due either to demographic stochasticity or to environmental stochasticity. In the first case, an individual may have a large number of offspring and we introduce the class of continuous state branching processes. In the second case, catastrophes may occur and kill a random fraction of the population and the process enjoys a quenched branching property. We emphasize on the study of the Laplace transform, which allows us to classify the long time behavior of these processes. In the second chapter, we model structured populations by measure-valued stochastic differential equations. Our approach is based on the individual dynamics. The individuals are characterized by parameters which have an influence on their survival or reproduction ability. Some of these parameters can be genetic and are inheritable except when mutations occur, but they can also be a space location or a quantity of parasites. The individuals compete for resources or other environmental constraints. We describe the population by a point measure-valued Markov process. We study macroscopic approximations of this process depending on the interplay between different scalings and obtain in the limit either integro-differential equations or reaction-diffusion equations or nonlinear super-processes. In each case, we insist on the specific techniques for the proof of convergence and for the study of the limiting model. The limiting processes offer different models of mutation-selection dynamics. Then, we study two-level models motivated by cell division dynamics, where the cell population is discrete and characterized by a trait, which may be continuous. In 1 particular, we finely study a process for parasite infection and the trait is the parasite load. The latter grows following a Feller diffusion and is randomly shared in the two daughter cells when the cell divides. Finally, we focus on the neutral case when the rate of division of cells is constant but the trait evolves following a general Markov process and may split in a random number of cells. The long time behavior of the structured population is then linked and derived from the behavior a well chosen SDE (monotype population).","(478, 24)","This research paper explores the use of stochastic models to describe the behavior of structured populations. The focus is on developing scaling limits and long-time behavior for these models. The development of such models is crucial for the analysis of population dynamics since natural systems often exhibit complex structures.

The study of structured populations is relevant in various fields, including ecology, epidemiology, and genetics. The models presented in this paper take into account characteristics such as age, size, or location, which play significant roles in population dynamics. This research aims to provide tools for understanding the complex interactions occurring within populations and the factors influencing their behavior.

To achieve this goal, the paper begins by presenting models at the individual level, where stochastic processes govern the behavior of each member of the population. The authors then delve into multi-individual models, discussing how these interactions can influence the population dynamics. The use of stochastic models allows for the incorporation of randomness and uncertainty in the behavior of individuals, which may be key elements in the dynamics of some populations.

One challenging aspect when studying structured populations is the need to consider the long-term behavior of these systems. Therefore, the authors investigate the scaling limits of these models. Scaling limits provide information about the asymptotic behavior of the system, which is essential for understanding the dynamics of populations over extended periods.

The authors then apply the developed methods to various case studies such as predator-prey systems and epidemics. The results show that stochastic models can provide accurate predictions of population dynamics and capture subtle interactions. Furthermore, long-term behavior analysis reveals population behaviors, such as extinction probabilities or oscillating periods.

In summary, this research paper proposes a framework for the development of stochastic models to study structured populations. The use of scaling limits and long-term behavior analysis is critical for understanding the dynamics of these systems, which play a crucial role in various scientific domains. The applications to predator-prey systems and epidemics demonstrate the usefulness of these models for practical scenarios. The findings of this research can help to provide insights into complex interactions between individuals in populations and to build models capable of predicting their behavior over time.","(401, 19)","The first chapter concerns monotype population models. We first study general birth and death processes
on the non-negative integers. In particular, we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the
population size as time goes to infinity. We show that if the birth and death rates satisfy certain
conditions, then the population size converges in distribution to an exponential random variable. This
result is known as the Yaglom limit. We then consider a special case of the birth and death process
where the birth rate is constant and the death rate is proportional to the population size. We show that
in this case, the population size grows linearly with time. Finally, we consider a generalization of the
birth and death process where the population size can take on negative values. We show that in this case,
the population size converges to a random variable that is a mixture of an exponential random variable
and a normal random variable. This result is known as the generalized Yaglom limit.
The second chapter concerns multitype population models. We consider a system of differential equations
that describe the evolution of the population sizes of different types of individuals. We show that under
certain conditions, the population sizes converge to a stationary distribution. We also show that the
stationary distribution is unique. These results are known as the Perron-Frobenius theorem and the
ergodic theorem, respectively. We then apply these results to a specific example of a multitype
population model. In this example, there are two types of individuals, A and B. Individuals of type A
give birth to individuals of type B at a constant rate, while individuals of type B give birth to
individuals of type A at a rate that is proportional to the number of individuals of type B. We show
that in this case, the proportion of individuals of type A converges to a constant, while the proportion
of individuals of type B converges to zero.

structured population models. In this framework, the population is divided into subpopulations, and the
dynamics of each subpopulation are described by a set of differential equations. We show how to use this

models with spatial structure, and models with both age and spatial structure. We also show how to use
this framework to study the long-term behavior of structured population models.

","In 1953, the physicists E. Inon\""u and E.P. Wigner introduced the concept of deformation of a Lie algebra by claiming that the limit $1/c \rightarrow 0$, when c is the speed of light, of the composition law $(u,v) \rightarrow (u+v)/(1+(uv/c^2))$ of speeds in special relativity (Poincar\'e group) should produce the composition law $(u,v) \rightarrow u + v $ used in classical mechanics (Galil\'ee group). However, the dimensionless composition law $(u'=u/c,v'=v/c) \rightarrow (u'+v')/(1+u'v')$ does not contain any longer a perturbation parameter. Nevertheless, this idea brought the birth of the "" deformation theory of algebraic structures"", culminating in the use of the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of Lie algebras and one of the first applications of computer algebra in the seventies. One may also notice that the main idea of general relativity is to deform the Minkowski metric of space-time by means of the small dimensionless parameter $\phi/c^2$ where $\phi=GM/r$ is the gravitational potential at a distance r of a central attractive mass M with gravitational constant G. A few years later, a "" deformation theory of geometric structures "" on manifolds of dimension n was introduced and one may quote riemannian, symplectic or complex analytic structures. Though often conjectured, the link between the two approaches has never been exhibited and the aim of this paper is to provide the solution of this problem by new methods. The key tool is made by the "" Vessiot structure equations "" (1903) for Lie groups or Lie pseudogroups of transformations, which, contrary to the "" Cartan structure equations "", are still unknown today and contain "" structure constants "" which, like in the case of constant riemannian curvature, have in general nothing to do with any Lie algebra. The main idea is then to introduce the purely differential Janet sequence $0 \rightarrow \Theta \rightarrow T \rightarrow F_0 \rightarrow F_1 \rightarrow ... \rightarrow F_n \rightarrow 0$ as a resolution of the sheaf $\Theta \subset T$ of infinitesimal transformations and to induce a purely algebraic "" deformation sequence "" with finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps, even if $\Theta$ is infinite dimensional. The infinitesimal equivalence problem for geometric structures has to do with the local exactness at $ F_0 $ of the Janet sequence while the deformation problem for algebraic structures has to do with the exactness of the deformation sequence at the invariant sections of $F_1 $, that is ONE STEP FURTHER ON in the sequence and this unexpected result explains why the many tentatives previously quoted have not been successful. Finally, we emphasize through examples the part that could be played by computer algebra in any explicit computation.","(520, 10)","The aim of this research paper is to investigate deformation cohomology of algebraic and geometric structures and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the properties and applications of this mathematical concept. This research focuses on the study of deformations of algebraic structures, in particular Lie algebras and polynomial algebras, and their cohomology groups. Moreover, it addresses the geometric aspects of deformation theory, such as moduli spaces and their description.

Deformation cohomology is a mathematical tool that plays a fundamental role in the study of geometric and algebraic structures. It provides a framework to study deformations of structures, that is, continuous families of structures that are obtained from a given structure by a small perturbation. Such families arise naturally in several areas of mathematics and physics, including algebraic geometry, topology, and theoretical physics.

In the first part of the paper, we provide an introduction to deformation theory, including the main definitions and results. We describe in detail Lie algebra deformations and their cohomology groups, which are important in the study of Lie algebra homology and representation theory. Moreover, we introduce the concept of Hochschild cohomology, which is a generalization of the Lie algebra cohomology, and its relevance to the deformation theory of polynomial algebras.

In the second part of the paper, we focus on geometric aspects of deformation theory. We study moduli spaces, which are spaces that classify families of structures up to isomorphism. We provide a detailed description of moduli spaces of curves and their relation to the deformation theory of complex structures. Additionally, we introduce the concept of derived moduli spaces, which are spaces that classify not only families of structures but also certain derived structures.

In the final part of the paper, we discuss some of the applications of deformation cohomology in mathematics and physics. We provide examples of its use in the study of mirror symmetry, quantization, and noncommutative geometry. Moreover, we discuss the relation between deformation theory and algebraic geometry, and the role of deformation cohomology in the study of Calabi-Yau manifolds and their mirror symmetry.

In conclusion, this research paper provides an in-depth study of deformation cohomology of algebraic and geometric structures. We believe that our work will be of interest to mathematicians and physicists working in the fields of algebraic geometry, topology, and theoretical physics. Finally, we hope that this paper will inspire further research in this fascinating subject.","(442, 19)","In 1953, the physicists E. Inon\""u and E.P. Wigner introduced the concept of deformation of

Deformations are a fundamental concept in mathematics and physics, and they play a crucial role
in many areas of research. A deformation of an algebraic or geometric structure is a smooth
family of structures that interpolates between two given structures. For example, a deformation
of a manifold is a smooth family of manifolds that connects two given manifolds. Deformations
can be used to study the behavior of a structure under small perturbations, and they can also be
used to construct new structures from existing ones.
The theory of deformations was first developed in the context of algebraic geometry, where it
was used to study the moduli spaces of algebraic varieties. However, deformations have since
been studied in many other areas of mathematics and physics, including differential geometry,
topology, and theoretical physics. In particular, deformations have played a crucial role in the
development of string theory, where they are used to study the dynamics of strings and branes.
One of the main tools used in the study of deformations is the concept of deformation
cohomology. Deformation cohomology is a cohomology theory that is designed to study the
behavior of deformations. It is a generalization of the classical cohomology theories, such as
de Rham cohomology and singular cohomology, and it has many applications in both pure and
applied mathematics. In particular, deformation cohomology has been used to study the
geometry of moduli spaces, the topology of manifolds, and the dynamics of string theory.

We used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to map a large field of approximately $2^{\circ}
","We used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to map a large field of approximately $2^{\circ} \times 2^{\circ}$ around the Sculptor group galaxy NGC~300 in the 21-cm line emission of neutral hydrogen. We achieved a $5 \sigma$ \ion{H}{i} column density sensitivity of $10^{19}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ over a spectral channel width of $8~\mathrm{km \, s}^{-1}$ for emission filling the $180'' \times 88''$ synthesised beam. The corresponding \ion{H}{i} mass sensitivity is $1.2 \times 10^{5}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, assuming a distance of $1.9~\mathrm{Mpc}$. For the first time, the vast \ion{H}{i} disc of NGC~300 has been mapped over its entire extent at a moderately high spatial resolution of about $1~\mathrm{kpc}$.

NGC~300 is characterised by a dense inner \ion{H}{i} disc, well aligned with the optical disc of $290^{\circ}$ orientation angle, and an extended outer \ion{H}{i} disc with a major axis of more than $1^{\circ}$ on the sky (equivalent to a diameter of about $35~\mathrm{kpc}$) and a different orientation angle of $332^{\circ}$. A significant fraction (about 43~per cent) of the total detected \ion{H}{i} mass of $1.5 \times 10^{9}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ resides within the extended outer disc. We fitted a tilted ring model to the velocity field of NGC~300 to derive the rotation curve out to a radius of $18.4~\mathrm{kpc}$, almost twice the range of previous rotation curve studies.

The rotation curve rises to a maximum velocity of almost $100~\mathrm{km \, s}^{-1}$ and then gently decreases again in the outer disc beyond a radius of about $10~\mathrm{kpc}$. Mass models fitted to the derived rotation curve yield good fits for Burkert and NFW dark matter halo models, whereas pseudo-isothermal halo models and MOND-based models both struggle to cope with the declining rotation curve.

We also observe significant asymmetries in the outer \ion{H}{i} disc of NGC~300, in particular near the edge of the disc, which are possibly due to ram pressure stripping of gas by the intergalactic medium (IGM) of the Sculptor group. Our estimates show that ram pressure stripping can occur under reasonable assumptions on the density of the IGM and the relative velocity of NGC~300. The asymmetries in the gas disc suggest a proper motion of NGC~300 toward the south-east. At the same time, our data exclude IGM densities of significantly higher than $10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ in the vicinity of NGC~300, as otherwise the outer gas disc would have been stripped.","(571, 13)","This paper presents an analysis of the gas and dark matter properties of the Sculptor group, focusing on the galaxy NGC 300. We use multi-wavelength observations obtained with different telescopes to study the kinematics, morphology, and physical properties of the neutral hydrogen gas and the dark matter halo in this system.

Our observations reveal a complex and extended gas distribution in NGC 300, with prominent spiral arms and two major gas streams extending to the northwest and southeast of the galaxy. The gas kinematics show a clear deviation from a regular rotating disk, with large-scale non-circular motions and velocity gradients. We find evidence for gas inflows toward the center of NGC 300, possibly driven by interactions with nearby companions or by a bar instability in the central region.

Our analysis of the dark matter distribution in NGC 300 is based on the assumption that the gas is in dynamical equilibrium with the underlying gravitational potential. By modeling the observed gas kinematics, we derive the mass profile of the dark matter halo and its main parameters, such as the concentration and the virial mass. Our results suggest that the dark matter halo in NGC 300 is less concentrated and less massive than typical halos in cosmological simulations.

We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies in the local Universe. The complex gas kinematics and morphology of NGC 300 reveal the importance of non-equilibrium processes in shaping the interstellar medium, such as gas inflows, outflows, and turbulence. The low concentration and low mass of the dark matter halo suggest that NGC 300 has experienced a relatively quiescent assembly history and that it may represent a transitional stage between dwarf and spiral galaxies.

Overall, our study demonstrates the power of deep and high-resolution observations of the neutral hydrogen gas and the dark matter halo in nearby galaxies, and provides new insights into the physics of galaxy evolution. Future observations with upcoming facilities, such as the Square Kilometer Array and the James Webb Space Telescope, will enable us to further investigate the properties of gas and dark matter in the Sculptor group and beyond.","(387, 13)","We used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to map a large field of approximately $2^{\circ}
\times 2^{\circ}$ centred on the Sculptor group galaxy NGC 300. Our goal was to study the distribution of gas and dark matter in this group, which is located at a distance of about 1.9 Mpc. We used the H i 21-cm line to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen (H i) gas, and the CO(1-0) line to trace molecular gas. We also used optical imaging data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study the stellar populations in the group.
Our results show that NGC 300 is surrounded by a large halo of H i gas, with a total mass of about $10^{10} M_{\odot}$. The H i gas extends out to a radius of about 100 kpc, and has a velocity dispersion of about 50 km s$^{-1}$. We also found that NGC 300 has a significant amount of molecular gas, with a mass of about $5 \times 10^{8} M_{\oplus}$. The molecular gas is concentrated in the central regions of the galaxy, and has a higher velocity dispersion than the H i gas.
We also studied the dark matter distribution in NGC 300 using weak gravitational lensing measurements. We found that the dark matter halo of NGC 300 is more extended than the H i halo, with a radius of up to 200 kpc. The dark matter halo also has a higher mass-to-light ratio than the stellar halo, indicating that it is dominated by dark matter.
Our results have important implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies in groups. The presence of a large H i halo around NGC 300 suggests that gas accretion plays an important role in the growth of galaxies in these environments. The detection of molecular gas in NGC 300 also suggests that star formation is ongoing in this galaxy, despite its relatively low metallicity. Finally, the extended dark matter halo ofNGC 300 suggests that dark matter may play a more important role in the dynamics of galaxies in groups than previously thought.
Overall, our results provide new insights into the gas and dark matter content of galaxies in groups, and highlight the importance of studying these systems in detail.","(438, 16)",,

","Graphs are commonly used to characterise interactions between objects of interest. Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used in many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this paper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning.

This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels or numerical values attached to nodes using both the graph and, when they are available, node characteristics. Balancing the two sources of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or globally. In both contexts, supervised and un-supervised, data can be relational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or graph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a full graph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this context, natural tasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than clusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 1 Real networks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the original work of Moreno [51] in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing interest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling and the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific fields. In Biology [54, 2, 7], for instance, metabolic networks can describe pathways of biochemical reactions [41], while in social sciences networks are used to represent relation ties between actors [66, 56, 36, 34]. Other examples include powergrids [71] and the web [75]. Recently, networks have also been considered in other areas such as geography [22] and history [59, 39]. In machine learning, networks are seen as powerful tools to model problems in order to extract information from data and for prediction purposes. This is the object of this paper. For more complete surveys, we refer to [28, 62, 49, 45].

In this section, we introduce notations and highlight properties shared by most real networks. In Section 2, we then consider methods aiming at extracting information from a unique network. We will particularly focus on clustering methods where the goal is to find clusters of vertices.

Next, we explore how graphs can be used to model various aspects of machine learning, such as clustering and classification.

One key application of graphs in machine learning is community detection, where nodes within a graph are grouped into clusters based on their structural similarities. We review different approaches to community detection, including modularity optimization and spectral clustering, and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. 

Another important application is graph-based semi-supervised learning, where partially labeled data is used to predict labels for unlabeled nodes within a graph. We explore different semi-supervised learning algorithms, such as label propagation and graph convolutional networks, and discuss their performance on real-world datasets.

Finally, we discuss some of the challenges and open research problems in the field of graph-based machine learning, such as scalability and interpretability. We conclude by summarizing the key points of the paper and highlighting the potential impact of graphs in future machine learning applications.

Context: Computational notebooks are a contemporary style of literate programming, in which users can communicate
","Context: Computational notebooks are a contemporary style of literate programming, in which users can communicate and transfer knowledge by interleaving executable code, output, and prose in a single rich document. A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is an artificial software language tailored for a particular application domain. Usually, DSL users are domain experts that may not have a software engineering background. As a consequence, they might not be familiar with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Thus, the development of tools that offer different interfaces for interacting with a DSL is relevant.

Inquiry: However, resources available to DSL designers are limited. We would like to leverage tools used to interact with general purpose languages in the context of DSLs. Computational notebooks are an example of such tools. Then, our main question is: What is an efficient and effective method of designing and implementing notebook interfaces for DSLs? By addressing this question we might be able to speed up the development of DSL tools, and ease the interaction between end-users and DSLs.

Approach: In this paper, we present Bacat\'a, a mechanism for generating notebook interfaces for DSLs in a language parametric fashion. We designed this mechanism in a way in which language engineers can reuse as many language components (e.g., language processors, type checkers, code generators) as possible.

Knowledge: Our results show that notebook interfaces generated by Bacat\'a can be automatically generated with little manual configuration. There are few considerations and caveats that should be addressed by language engineers that rely on language design aspects. The creation of a notebook for a DSL with Bacat\'a becomes a matter of writing the code that wires existing language components in the Rascal language workbench with the Jupyter platform.

Grounding: We evaluate Bacat\'a by generating functional computational notebook interfaces for three different non-trivial DSLs, namely: a small subset of Halide (a DSL for digital image processing), SweeterJS (an extended version of JavaScript), and QL (a DSL for questionnaires). Additionally, it is relevant to generate notebook implementations rather than implementing them manually. We measured and compared the number of Source Lines of Code (SLOCs) that we reused from existing implementations of those languages.

Importance: The adoption of notebooks by novice-programmers and end-users has made them very popular in several domains such as exploratory programming, data science, data journalism, and machine learning. Why are they popular? In (data) science, it is essential to make results reproducible as well as understandable. However, notebooks are only available for GPLs. This paper opens up the notebook metaphor for DSLs to improve the end-user experience when interacting with code and to increase DSLs adoption.","(508, 23)","Bacatá is a novel solution for developing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) with minimal cost, reducing the time spent on creating compilers and interpreters, and enabling developers to focus on the language semantics. This paper presents the Bacatá system, which uses notation and tooling to facilitate the development of DSLs and their associated tooling. Bacatá provides a set of notebooks with pre-defined and customizable templates making it incredibly easy and highly efficient to create DSLs.

Creating DSLs traditionally requires significant resources, thus limiting DSLs' popularity and usage. However, Bacatá significantly reduces the time and cost needed for the development of DSLs; furthermore, Bacatá offers a magnificent solution for domain experts and non-expert programmers to create simpler and more manageable DSLs.

The Bacatá notebooks provide pre-established tools, which allow programmers to create DSLs close to their domain language. For instance, by providing an interface for specifying the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), the notebooks offer DSL designers an incredibly powerful tool for selecting and crafting the language syntax. Bacatá revolutionizes the world of DSL designing, eliminating the need for an in-depth understanding of metaprogramming APIs, syntax analysis, and compiler design.

Our research shows that Bacatá notebooks have a low learning curve, making it possible for new developers to use them effectively. Bacatá increases productivity, thus, enhancing the development process of DSLs to improve the development process. This seamless approach raises the potential for the development of multiple DSLs within different domains, thus expanding their usage and adoption.

We provide comprehensive evaluation benchmarks using three established DSLs to demonstrate Bacatá's advantages in comparison to related DSL development solutions. Our results demonstrate that Bacatá eliminates the overhead of traditional DSL development. The evaluation also shows that Bacatá produces high-quality DSLs that are compatible with humans and tools.

In conclusion, Bacatá is a cost-effective and innovative solution for DSL development, which has a negligible learning curve and enhances productivity significantly. Bacatá’s notebooks’ functionality impressively simplifies the DSL design and produces high-quality DSLs in fewer development cycles. Hence, Bacatá shows the potential to assist developers and domain experts in crafting DSLs closer to their language, thereby effectively reducing the barriers to adopting DSLs.","(402, 17)","Context: Computational notebooks are a contemporary style of literate programming, in which users can communicate
their code, data, and results in a single document. However, existing notebook systems do not support domain-specific

Research Question: How can we design a notebook system that supports domain-specific languages?
Methodology: We designed Bacat\'a as a modular and extensible notebook system that allows users to define their
own custom syntax and semantics. We implemented Bacat\'a using a combination of Python and C++, and evaluated its
performance on a set of benchmarks.
Findings: Our evaluation showed that Bacat\'{a} outperformed existing notebook systems in both speed and memory

We generalize the classical cow-path problem [7, 14, 38, 39] into a question that is
","We generalize the classical cow-path problem [7, 14, 38, 39] into a question that is relevant for collective foraging in animal groups. Specifically, we consider a setting in which k identical (probabilistic) agents, initially placed at some central location, collectively search for a treasure in the two-dimensional plane. The treasure is placed at a target location by an adversary and the goal is to find it as fast as possible as a function of both k and D, where D is the distance between the central location and the target.

This is biologically motivated by cooperative, central place foraging such as performed by ants around their nest. In this type of search there is a strong preference to locate nearby food sources before those that are further away.

Our focus is on trying to find what can be achieved if communication is limited or altogether absent. Indeed, to avoid overlaps agents must be highly dispersed making communication difficult. Furthermore, if agents do not commence the search in synchrony then even initial communication is problematic. This holds, in particular, with respect to the question of whether the agents can communicate and conclude their total number, k. It turns out that the knowledge of k by the individual agents is crucial for performance. Indeed, it is a straightforward observation that the time required for finding the treasure is $\Omega$(D + D 2 /k), and we show in this paper that this bound can be matched if the agents have knowledge of k up to some constant approximation. We present an almost tight bound for the competitive penalty that must be paid, in the running time, if agents have no information about k. Specifically, on the negative side, we show that in such a case, there is no algorithm whose competitiveness is O(log k). On the other hand, we show that for every constant $\epsilon \textgreater{} 0$, there exists a rather simple uniform search algorithm which is $O( \log^{1+\epsilon} k)$-competitive. In addition, we give a lower bound for the setting in which agents are given some estimation of k.

As a special case, this lower bound implies that for any constant $\epsilon \textgreater{} 0$, if each agent is given a (one-sided) $k^\epsilon$-approximation to k, then the competitiveness is $\Omega$(log k).

Informally, our results imply that the agents can potentially perform well without any knowledge of their total number k, however, to further improve, they must be given a relatively good approximation of k. Finally, we propose a uniform algorithm that is both efficient and extremely simple suggesting its relevance for actual biological scenarios.","(513, 14)","Collaborative search on the plane without communication presents a novel approach to solving the task of finding a target on a flat surface, without the use of communication among the searchers. This is a challenging, yet realistic problem that has not been fully explored in the literature to date. The proposed solution consists of a distributed algorithm that leverages a combination of individual heuristic rules and probabilistic reasoning to guide the searchers towards the target. 

Each searcher is equipped with a sensor that can detect the target with some level of uncertainty and can communicate only with very close neighbors within a certain range. No global information about the sensor measurements or search process is shared among the searchers, which makes the task quite complex. The algorithm is designed to enable the searchers to coordinate their movements and avoid redundant exploration by exploiting the limited communication capabilities. 

The algorithm incorporates a distributed consensus mechanism, where each searcher maintains its belief about the target's location based on its sensor readings and the interactions with its neighbors. This belief is updated by combining the information from its own observations with that of its neighbors using a Bayesian inference framework. The final consensus is reached by using a likelihood function that takes into account the uncertainty in the observations and the reliability of the neighbors. 

The proposed approach is evaluated using a set of simulations and compared to a centralized algorithm that has access to all the sensor measurements. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve comparable performance to the centralized algorithm, while using only local information and limited communication. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown to be scalable and robust to changes in the search environment, such as the disappearance and sudden reappearance of the target.

The proposed algorithm has several potential applications in the field of swarm robotics and autonomous systems. For example, it can be used in search and rescue operations, where a team of robots needs to search for a missing person in a hazardous environment. The algorithm can also be applied in precision agriculture, where a team of drones needs to identify and localize diseased crops in a field without the need for expensive communication infrastructure.

In conclusion, the proposed collaborative search algorithm presents a practical solution to the problem of finding a target on a plane without communication. The algorithm leverages a combination of distributed consensus, probabilistic reasoning, and individual heuristic rules to enable the searchers to coordinate their movements and avoid redundant exploration. The algorithm is shown to be robust and scalable, and has potential applications in many real-world scenarios.","(471, 18)","We generalize the classical cow-path problem [7, 14, 38, 39] into a question that is

meet. The goal is to minimize the time it takes for the searchers to meet. In our
generalization, the searchers start at arbitrary points on the plane and move towards
each other until they meet. The goal is still to minimize the meeting time. However,
the searchers are not allowed to communicate with each other during the search.

With the aim of quantifying the contribution of the environment on the evolution of galaxies
","With the aim of quantifying the contribution of the environment on the evolution of galaxies at z=0 we have used the DR7 catalogue of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to reconstruct the 3-D distribution of 4132 galaxies in 420 square degrees of the Coma supercluster, containing two rich clusters (Coma and A1367), several groups, and many filamentary structures belonging to the ""Great Wall"", at the approximate distance of 100 Mpc. At this distance the galaxy census is complete to Mi=-17.5 mag, i.e. approx 4 mag fainter than M*.

The morphological classification of galaxies into early- (ellipticals) and late-types (spirals) was carried out by inspection of individual SDSS images and spectra. The density around each galaxies was determined in cylinders of 1 Mpc radius and 1000 km s^-1 half length. The color-luminosity relation was derived for galaxies in bins morphological type and in four thresholds of galaxy density-contrast, ranging from delta{1,1000} <= 0 (UL = the cosmic web); 0 < delta{1,1000} <= 4 (L = the loose groups); 4 < delta{1,1000} <= 20 (H = the large groups and the cluster's outskirts) and delta{1,1000} > 20 (UH = the cluster's cores). The fraction of early-type galaxies increases with the log of the over-density. A well defined ""red sequence"" composed of early-type galaxies exists in all environments at high luminosity, but it lacks of low luminosity (dwarf) galaxies in the lowest density environment. Conversely low luminosity isolated galaxies are predominantly of late-type. In other words the low luminosity end of the distribution is dominated by red dE galaxies in clusters and groups and by dwarf blue amorphous systems in the lowest density regions.

At z=0 we find evidence for strong evolution induced by the environment (Nurture). Transformations take place mostly at low luminosity when star forming dwarf galaxies inhabiting low density environments migrate into amorphous passive dwarf ellipticals in their infall into denser regions. The mechanism involves suppression of the star formation due to gas stripping, without significant mass growth, as proposed by Boselli et al. (2008a). This process is more efficient and fast in ambients of increasing density. In the highest density environments (around clusters) the truncation of the star formation happens fast enough (few 100 Myr) to produce the signature of post-star-burst in galaxy spectra. PSB galaxies, that are in fact found significantly clustered around the largest dynamical units, represent the remnants of star forming isolated galaxies that had their star formation violently suppressed during their infall in clusters in the last 0.5-1.5 Gyrs, and the progenitors of future dEs.","(500, 17)","The Great Wall is a strip of dense clusters, stretching for around 500 million light years in the Universe. It is one of the largest and most impressive known structures in the cosmos, making it an ideal location for investigating galaxy evolution. In this paper, we present a snapshot of galaxy evolution and the role of nurture in this process at redshift (z) equal to zero.

We have used deep, multi-wavelength surveys to study the Great Wall and its associated environment, with the aim of identifying and characterizing the properties of the galaxies inhabiting this colossal structure. Our analysis reveals a diverse population of galaxies, ranging from massive ellipticals to small dwarf galaxies. We have also observed significant variations in the properties of these galaxies, such as their star formation rate, color, and morphology.

Using sophisticated statistical techniques, we have quantified the relative importance of nurture (environment) and nature (intrinsic properties) in shaping the observed galaxy population. Our results indicate that nurture plays a crucial role in driving galaxy evolution, by affecting the star formation rate and morphological transformation of the galaxies.

We have also investigated the connection between galaxy properties and their position within the Great Wall. Our analysis has revealed that galaxies residing in the densest regions of the structure tend to have lower star formation rates and redder colors than those located in the outskirts. This suggests that the Great Wall acts as a ""galaxy zoo"", hosting a broad range of galaxies, but with properties that are sensitive to their environment.

Finally, we have compared our findings with predictions from cosmological simulations, revealing a good agreement with the simulated galaxy population, suggesting that our results can be generalized to other similar structures in the Universe.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of galaxy evolution occurring in the Great Wall, highlighting the crucial role played by nurture in shaping the observed galaxy population. Our results shed light on the complex interplay between galaxies and their environment and offer new insights into the physical processes that regulate galaxy formation and evolution.","(384, 14)","With the aim of quantifying the contribution of the environment on the evolution of galaxies
in the Great Wall (GW), we present an analysis of the stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies
at redshift z = 0. The GW is one of the largest known structures in the Universe, spanning
more than 200 Mpc and containing thousands of galaxies. We use data from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) to measure the SMF of galaxies in the GW and compare it to the SMF of
galaxies in the rest of the Universe. Our results show that galaxies in the GW have a higher
stellar mass compared to galaxies in the same redshift range but outside the GW. This
indicates that the environment plays a significant role in the evolution of galaxies in the
GW. We discuss the implications of our findings for our understanding of the formation and
evolution of galaxies in the Universe.","(168, 6)",,

We establish weak well-posedness for critical symmetric stable driven SDEs in R d with additive
","We establish weak well-posedness for critical symmetric stable driven SDEs in R d with additive noise Z, d $\ge$ 1. Namely, we study the case where the stable index of the driving process Z is $\alpha$ = 1 which exactly corresponds to the order of the drift term having the coefficient b which is continuous and bounded. In particular, we cover the cylindrical case when Zt = (Z 1 t ,. .. , Z d t) and Z 1 ,. .. , Z d are independent one dimensional Cauchy processes.

Our approach relies on L p-estimates for stable operators and uses perturbative arguments. 1. Statement of the problem and main results We are interested in proving well-posedness for the martingale problem associated with the following SDE: (1.1) X t = x + t 0 b(X s)ds + Z t , where (Z s) s$\ge$0 stands for a symmetric d-dimensional stable process of order $\alpha$ = 1 defined on some filtered probability space ($\Omega$, F, (F t) t$\ge$0 , P) (cf. [2] and the references therein) under the sole assumptions of continuity and boundedness on the vector valued coefficient b: (C) The drift b : R d $\rightarrow$ R d is continuous and bounded. 1 Above, the generator L of Z writes: L$\Phi$(x) = p.v.

(1.2) (here $\times$, $\times$ (or $\times$) and | $\times$ | denote respectively the inner product and the norm in R d). In the above equation, $\nu$ is the L{\'e}vy intensity measure of Z, S d--1 is the unit sphere of R d and$\mu$ is a spherical measure on S d--1. It is well know, see e.g. [20] that the L{\'e}vy exponent $\Phi$ of Z writes as: (1.3) $\Phi$($\lambda$) = E[exp(i $\lambda$, Z 1)] = exp -- S d--1 | $\lambda$, $\theta$ |$\mu$(d$\theta$) , $\lambda$ $\in$ R d , where $\mu$ = c 1$\mu$ , for a positive constant c 1 , is the so-called spectral measure of Z.

Our methodology could apply, up to suitable localization arguments, to a drift b having linear growth.","(704, 20)","We investigate the weak well-posedness of multidimensional SDEs driven by stable Lévy processes with index in the range $(1,2]$. In particular, we consider the critical case where the Lévy index equals $2$. Under some regularity assumptions on the coefficients, we prove that the SDE under consideration admits a unique weak solution. Moreover, we show that this solution is a Markov process with continuous paths. Our proof is based on the approximation of the SDE by a sequence of better-behaved SDEs and the application of the PDE method for the latter. We further demonstrate the necessity of our assumptions by providing examples where either uniqueness or continuity of the solution fails. In addition, we provide a comparison result for two different stability indices. Our results generalize the well-known case of Brownian motion, and we believe that they may find applications in various fields including finance, physics, and engineering. Finally, we mention some open problems such as the extension of our results to non-Markovian settings and the study of regularity properties of the solutions. We hope that our work will contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of stochastic differential equations driven by stable Lévy processes, which are known to exhibit various exotic phenomena such as jumps, long-range dependence, and heavy tails.","(238, 10)","We establish weak well-posedness for critical symmetric stable driven SDEs in R d with additive

to control the moments of the solution. We also show that the law of the solution is absolutely

","-Purpose: A neural network estimator to process x-ray spectral measurements from photon counting detectors with pileup. The estimator is used with an expansion of the attenuation coefficient as a linear combination of functions of energy multiplied by coefficients that depend on the material composition at points within the object [R.E. Alvarez and A. Macovski, Phys. Med. Biol., 1976, 733-744]. The estimator computes the line integrals of the coefficients from measurements with different spectra. Neural network estimators are trained with measurements of a calibration phantom with the clinical x-ray system. One estimator uses low noise training data and another network is trained with data computed by adding random noise to the low noise data. The performance of the estimators is compared to each other and to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).

Methods: The estimator performance is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation with an idealized model of a photon counting detector that includes only pileup and quantum noise. Transmitted x-ray spectra are computed for a calibration phantom. The transmitted spectra are used to compute random data for photon counting detectors with pileup. Detectors with small and large dead times are considered. Neural network training data with extremely low noise are computed by averaging the random detected data with pileup for a large numbers of exposures of the phantom. Each exposure is equivalent to a projection image or one projection of a computed tomography scan. Training data with high noise are computed by using data from one exposure. Finally, training data are computed by adding random data to the low noise data. The added random data are multivariate normal with zero mean and covariance equal to the sample covariance of data for an object with properly chosen attenuation. To test the estimators, random data are computed for different thicknesses of three test objects with different compositions. These are used as inputs to the neural network estimators. The mean squared errors (MSE), variance and square of the bias of the neural networks' outputs with the random object data are each compared to the CRLB. Results: The MSE for a network trained with low noise data and added noise is close to the CRLB for both the low and high pileup cases. Networks trained with very low noise data have low bias but large variance for both pileup cases. ralvarez@aprendtech.com Networks trained with high noise data have both large bias and large variance. Conclusion: With a properly chosen level of added training data noise, a neural network estimator for photon counting data with pileup can have variance close to the CRLB with negligible bias.","(475, 25)","This paper proposes a near-optimal neural network estimator for spectral X-ray photon counting data with pileup. Spectral photon counting detectors (PCDs) have attracted significant interest as a promising technology for X-ray imaging and computed tomography. However, a major challenge with PCDs is the occurrence of pileup due to the high photon flux. Pileup leads to distortions in the energy spectrum and can compromise the accuracy of the reconstructed image. 

In this work, we present a novel approach to mitigate the pileup effect in spectral PCDs. The proposed estimator is based on a deep neural network architecture, which performs a nonlinear mapping of the measured photon counts to an estimate of the underlying photon spectrum. The network is trained on a large dataset of simulated photon counts, with varying levels of pileup and noise. The training dataset also incorporates realistic X-ray spectrum and detector response characteristics.

To optimize the neural network estimator, we introduce a new loss function that takes into account the statistical properties of photon counting and pileup. Specifically, the loss function uses a Poisson-Gamma mixture model to capture the effects of photon counting noise and pileup distortion on the measured counts. We also derive the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters, using a novel algorithm based on importance sampling.

Our experimental results show that the proposed estimator achieves near-optimal performance in terms of image quality and spectral accuracy, compared to state-of-the-art methods for spectral PCD reconstruction. We demonstrate this through extensive simulations on a range of X-ray imaging scenarios, including both phantom and patient datasets. Our results show that the proposed estimator is robust to variations in pileup and noise levels, and can effectively recover the true photon spectrum.

In conclusion, this paper proposes a novel and effective approach to address the pileup problem in spectral PCDs using a deep neural network estimator. The proposed method leverages the statistical properties of photon counting and pileup, and achieves near-optimal performance in spectral reconstruction.

We build in this paper a numerical solution procedure to compute the flow induced by
","We build in this paper a numerical solution procedure to compute the flow induced by a spherical flame expanding from a point source at a constant expansion velocity, with an instantaneous chemical reaction. The solution is supposed to be self-similar and the flow is split in three zones: an inner zone composed of burnt gases at rest, an intermediate zone where the solution is regular and the initial atmosphere composed of fresh gases at rest. The intermediate zone is bounded by the reactive shock (inner side) and the so-called precursor shock (outer side), for which Rankine-Hugoniot conditions are written; the solution in this zone is governed by two ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically. We show that, for any admissible precursor shock speed, the construction combining this numerical resolution with the exploitation of jump conditions is unique, and yields decreasing pressure, density and velocity profiles in the intermediate zone. In addition, the reactive shock speed is larger than the velocity on the outer side of the shock, which is consistent with the fact that the difference of these two quantities is the so-called flame velocity, i.e. the (relative) velocity at which the chemical reaction progresses in the fresh gases. Finally, we also observe numerically that the function giving the flame velocity as a function of the precursor shock speed is increasing; this allows to embed the resolution in a Newton-like procedure to compute the flow for a given flame speed (instead of for a given precursor shock speed). The resulting numerical algorithm is applied to stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixtures.

1. Problem position. We address the flame propagation in a reactive infinite atmosphere of initial constant composition. The ignition is supposed to occur at a single point (chosen to be the origin of R 3) and the flow is supposed to satisfy a spherical symmetry property: the density $\rho$, the pressure p, the internal energy e and the entropy s only depend on the distance r to the origin and the velocity reads u = ur/r, where r stands for the position vector. The flame is supposed to be infinitely thin and to move at a constant speed. The flow is governed by the Euler equations, and we seek a solution with the following structure:","(503, 19)","This paper presents the modelling of a deflagration, a type of combustion where the flame front moves relatively slowly, in a spherical shape at constant speed. Deflagration occurs in many industrial and natural processes, such as explosions, combustion engines, and forest fires. The modelling of this phenomenon can help researchers and engineers understand and predict its behavior.

The mathematical model used in this paper considers the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy, as well as the reaction kinetics and the species transport of the fuel and the oxidizer. The governing equations are solved numerically using the commercial software ANSYS Fluent, which is based on the finite volume method. The simulations are conducted in a three-dimensional domain and the inflow and outflow conditions are assumed to be symmetric and steady-state.

The results show that the deflagration wave propagates at a constant speed, which depends on the initial conditions and the properties of the mixture. As the wave travels, it heats up the unburnt gas ahead of it, and consumes the fuel and the oxidizer behind it. The temperature and pressure distributions are affected by the curvature of the spherical surface, the diffusivity of the species, and the flame thickness. The flame thickness is defined as the distance where the fuel is converted to the products.

The sensitivity analysis shows that the flame speed, the activation energy, and the inlet velocity have the largest impact on the deflagration dynamics. The flame speed can be controlled by adjusting the fuel-oxidizer ratio, the temperature, or the turbulence intensity. The activation energy is the minimum energy required to initiate the reaction and can be changed by adding catalytic species or using external ignition. The inlet velocity is the rate at which the unburnt gas enters the domain and can be modified by the geometry or the boundary conditions.

The comparison with the experimental data available in the literature shows a good agreement with the present results, which confirms the validity of the model. The limitations and the future work of the model are discussed in the conclusion. In summary, this paper presents the modelling of a spherical deflagration at constant speed using a numerical approach, and provides insights into the physics and the chemistry of this important phenomenon.","(412, 17)","We build in this paper a numerical solution procedure to compute the flow induced by

deflagration, such as the formation of a shock wave ahead of the flame front and the
expansion of the burned gas behind the flame front. The model can be used to study
the dynamics of spherical deflagrations in a wide range of applications, such as
combustion in engines, explosions, and astrophysical phenomena.
In this paper, we present a numerical solution procedure for computing the flow

based on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a reaction source
term to account for the chemical reactions involved in the detonation process. The
governing equations are written in spherical coordinates and solved numerically

non-uniform grid, and the equations are integrated over time using an explicit
second-order Runge-Kutta scheme. The code is written in Fortran 90 and parallelized
using the MPI library, which allows us to run the simulation on multiple processors.
The results show that the model is able to reproduce the main features of a
spherical detonation, such as the propagation of the shock wave and the expansion of
the burned gas. The model can also be used to study the effects of different
parameters, such as the initial pressure, temperature, and composition of the
reactants, on the dynamics of the detonation. Overall, the model presented in this
paper provides a useful tool for studying the dynamics of spherical detonations in a
wide range of applications, from combustion in engines to astrophysical phenomena.","(413, 15)",,

There currently exists a gap between the theories proposed by the probability and uncertainty and
","There currently exists a gap between the theories proposed by the probability and uncertainty and the needs of Artificial Intelligence research. These theories primarily address the needs of expert systems, using knowledge structures which must be pre-compiled and remain static in structure during runtime. Many Al systems require the ability to dynamically add and remove parts of the current knowledge structure (e.g., in order to examine what the world would be like for different causal theories). This requires more flexibility than existing uncertainty systems display. In addition, many Al researchers are only interested in using ""probabilities"" as a means of obtaining an ordering, rather than attempting to derive an accurate probabilistic account of a situation. This indicates the need for systems which stress ease of use and don't require extensive probability information when one cannot (or doesn't wish to) provide such information. This paper attempts to help reconcile the gap between approaches to uncertainty and the needs of many AI systems by examining the control issues which arise, independent of a particular uncertainty calculus. when one tries to satisfy these needs. Truth Maintenance Systems have been used extensively in problem solving tasks to help organize a set of facts and detect inconsistencies in the believed state of the world. These systems maintain a set of true/false propositions and their associated dependencies. However, situations often arise in which we are unsure of certain facts or in which the conclusions we can draw from available information are somewhat uncertain. The non-monotonic TMS 12] was an attempt at reasoning when all the facts are not known, but it fails to take into account degrees of belief and how available evidence can combine to strengthen a particular belief. This paper addresses the problem of probabilistic reasoning as it applies to Truth Maintenance Systems. It describes a belief Maintenance System that manages a current set of beliefs in much the same way that a TMS manages a set of true/false propositions. If the system knows that belief in fact is dependent in some way upon belief in fact2, then it automatically modifies its belief in facts when new information causes a change in belief of fact2. It models the behavior of a TMS, replacing its 3-valued logic (true, false, unknown) with an infinite valued logic, in such a way as to reduce to a standard TMS if all statements are given in absolute true/false terms. Belief Maintenance Systems can, therefore, be thought of as a generalization of Truth Maintenance Systems, whose possible reasoning tasks are a superset of those for a TMS.","(471, 17)","Belief maintenance systems play a crucial role in various fields including decision-making, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. The aim of this study is to develop a general-purpose belief maintenance system that can be applied across all these fields. 

We propose a novel approach that employs both consistency-based and context-aware techniques to ensure that the system's beliefs are accurate and up-to-date. The system operates on a dynamic knowledge base that is continuously updated with new information, enabling it to adapt to changing environments and situations.

We begin by discussing the traditional belief maintenance systems and highlighting their limitations in terms of scalability and flexibility. Our proposed general-purpose system addresses these issues by incorporating a modular architecture that allows users to easily customize the system to suit their specific needs.

We then present the design and implementation of our system, which comprises a belief revision component that handles conflicting information, a belief merging component that integrates new beliefs into the knowledge base, and a belief fusion component that reconciles inconsistent beliefs from different sources.

To assess the effectiveness of our system, we conducted experiments in several domains, including medical diagnosis, financial decision-making, and natural language processing. The results indicate that our system outperforms existing belief maintenance systems in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

In conclusion, our study presents a novel approach to developing a general-purpose belief maintenance system that can be applied across a wide range of domains. By combining various techniques, our system is able to maintain accurate and up-to-date beliefs in a scalable and flexible manner, enabling it to adapt to changing environments and situations. We believe that our system has the potential to significantly enhance decision-making processes and cognitive abilities in various fields.","(310, 12)","There currently exists a gap between the theories proposed by the probability and uncertainty and
the practical application of these theories in real-world scenarios. This gap is due to the lack of
a general-purpose belief maintenance system that can accurately represent and reason about
uncertain information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to developing such a system,
which we refer to as the ""Belief Maintenance System"" (BMS). The BMS is designed to address
this gap by providing a unified framework for representing and reasoning about uncertain
information in a variety of domains.
The BMS is based on the concept of Bayesian networks, which are directed acyclic graphs that
represent probabilistic relationships between variables. The BMS extends this concept by
allowing for the representation of both discrete and continuous variables, as well as the
incorporation of prior knowledge and domain-specific constraints. The BMS also includes
mechanisms for updating beliefs in response to new evidence, and for propagating these updates
through the network.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the BMS, we conducted a series of experiments in several
domains, including medical diagnosis, natural language processing, and decision making under
uncertainty. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the BMS is able to accurately
represent and reason about uncertain information in these domains, and outperforms existing

In conclusion, the BMS represents a significant step forward in the development of a general-

The symmetry algebras of certain families of quantum spin chains are considered in detail. The
","The symmetry algebras of certain families of quantum spin chains are considered in detail. The simplest examples possess m states per site (m\geq2), with nearest-neighbor interactions with U(m) symmetry, under which the sites transform alternately along the chain in the fundamental m and its conjugate representation \bar{m}. We find that these spin chains, even with {\em arbitrary} coefficients of these interactions, have a symmetry algebra A_m much larger than U(m), which implies that the energy eigenstates fall into sectors that for open chains (i.e., free boundary conditions) can be labeled by j=0, 1, >..., L, for the 2L-site chain, such that the degeneracies of all eigenvalues in the jth sector are generically the same and increase rapidly with j. For large j, these degeneracies are much larger than those that would be expected from the U(m) symmetry alone. The enlarged symmetry algebra A_m(2L) consists of operators that commute in this space of states with the Temperley-Lieb algebra that is generated by the set of nearest-neighbor interaction terms; A_m(2L) is not a Yangian. There are similar results for supersymmetric chains with gl(m+n|n) symmetry of nearest-neighbor interactions, and a richer representation structure for closed chains (i.e., periodic boundary conditions). The symmetries also apply to the loop models that can be obtained from the spin chains in a spacetime or transfer matrix picture. In the loop language, the symmetries arise because the loops cannot cross. We further define tensor products of representations (for the open chains) by joining chains end to end. The fusion rules for decomposing the tensor product of representations labeled j_1 and j_2 take the same form as the Clebsch-Gordan series for SU(2). This and other structures turn the symmetry algebra \cA_m into a ribbon Hopf algebra, and we show that this is ``Morita equivalent'' to the quantum group U_q(sl_2) for m=q+q^{-1}. The open-chain results are extended to the cases |m|< 2 for which the algebras are no longer semisimple; these possess continuum limits that are critical (conformal) field theories, or massive perturbations thereof. Such models, for open and closed boundary conditions, arise in connection with disordered fermions, percolation, and polymers (self-avoiding walks), and certain non-linear sigma models, all in two dimensions. A product operation is defined in a related way for the Temperley-Lieb representations also, and the fusion rules for this are related to those for A_m or U_q(sl_2) representations; this is useful for the continuum limits also, as we discuss in a companion paper.","(500, 14)","This paper explores the concept of enlarged symmetry algebras in the context of spin chains, loop models, and S-matrices. These algebras provide an extension of the usual symmetries of quantum systems, and have played a significant role in the study of integrable models.

We begin by reviewing the basics of the theory of symmetry algebras, and discuss the usual method for constructing them using commutation relations. We then introduce the notion of an enlarged symmetry algebra, which arises when additional generators are introduced that satisfy nontrivial commutation relations with the original ones. We show that, in some cases, these enlarged symmetry algebras can be built starting from a Lie algebra and a set of algebra automorphisms.

We then apply these ideas to the study of spin chains, which are one-dimensional arrays of spin-1/2 particles that are coupled according to a certain Hamiltonian. It is known that the symmetry algebra of a spin chain can be enlarged by introducing a set of additional generators that satisfy certain commutation relations with the original ones. We show that this enlarged symmetry algebra can be further extended by introducing additional mutually commuting generators that act nontrivially only on particular subsets of spin sites, leading to a hierarchy of symmetry algebras.

We also consider loop models, which are lattice models of statistical mechanics that describe the behavior of polymers and other long-chain molecules. We show that the symmetry algebra of a loop model can also be enlarged by introducing additional generators that act nontrivially on certain loops in the lattice. This leads to a rich structure of symmetries, which can be used to derive a variety of exact results for the model.

Finally, we discuss the connection between enlarged symmetry algebras and S-matrices, which provide a way to compute probabilities for particles to scatter off each other in a quantum system. We show that the symmetry algebra of a scattering matrix can also be enlarged by introducing additional generators that act nontrivially on certain parts of the Hilbert space. This leads to a deeper understanding of the symmetries of S-matrices, and can be used to derive exact results in some cases.

Overall, this paper demonstrates the importance of enlarged symmetry algebras in a variety of contexts in theoretical physics, and suggests new avenues for research in the study of integrable models.","(417, 15)","The symmetry algebras of certain families of quantum spin chains are considered in detail. The
symmetry algebras of these spin chains are shown to be closely related to the symmetry algebras
of certain families of loop models. In particular, it is shown that the symmetry algebra of a
certain family of spin chains is isomorphic to the symmetry algebra of the corresponding family
of loop models. This isomorphism is then used to construct an S-matrix for the corresponding
family of loop models. Finally, the implications of these results for the study of quantum spin
chains and loop models are discussed.","(107, 5)",,

We review the status of searches for sterile neutrinos in the $\sim 1$ eV range,
","We review the status of searches for sterile neutrinos in the $\sim 1$ eV range, with an emphasis on the latest results from short baseline oscillation experiments and how they fit within sterile neutrino oscillation models. We present global fit results to a three-active-flavor plus one-sterile-flavor model (3+1), where we find an improvement of $\Delta \chi^2=35$ for 3 additional parameters compared to a model with no sterile neutrino. This is a 5$\sigma$ improvement, indicating that an effect that is like that of a sterile neutrino is highly preferred by the data. However we note that separate fits to the appearance and disappearance oscillation data sets within a 3+1 model do not show the expected overlapping allowed regions in parameter space. This ""tension"" leads us to explore two options: 3+2, where a second additional mass state is introduced, and a 3+1+decay model, where the $\nu_4$ state can decay to invisible particles. The 3+1+decay model, which is also motivated by improving compatibility with cosmological observations, yields the larger improvement, with a $\Delta \chi^2=8$ for 1 additional parameter beyond the 3+1 model, which is a $2.6\sigma$ improvement. Moreover the tension between appearance and disappearance experiments is reduced compared to 3+1, although disagreement remains. In these studies, we use a frequentist approach and also a Bayesean method of finding credible regions.

With respect to this tension, we review possible problems with the global fitting method. We note multiple issues, including problems with reproducing the experimental results, especially in the case of experiments that do not provide adequate data releases. We discuss an unexpected 5 MeV excess, observed in the reactor flux energy spectrum, that may be affecting the oscillation interpretation of the short baseline reactor data. We emphasize the care that must be taken in mapping to the true neutrino energy in the case of oscillation experiments that are subject to multiple interaction modes and nuclear effects.

We point to problems with the ""Parameter-Goodness-of-Fit test"" that is used to quantify the tension. Lastly, we point out that analyses presenting limits often receive less scrutiny that signals.

While we provide a snapshot of the status of sterile neutrino searches today and global fits to their interpretation, we emphasize that this is a fast-moving field. We briefly review experiments that are expected to report new data in the immediate future. Lastly, we consider the 5-year horizon, where we propose that decay-at-rest neutrino sources are the best method of finally resolving the confusing situation.","(465, 17)","The search for light sterile neutrinos has been one of the most persistent and intriguing endeavors in particle physics. Despite strong experimental constraints, the possibility of these elusive particles existing beyond the three known active neutrinos is still an open question. In this review, we examine the current status of the search for light sterile neutrinos in both short-baseline and long-baseline experiments.

A comprehensive analysis of short-baseline oscillation experiments shows that hints of sterile neutrino existence are persistent but not conclusive. The most conclusive indication comes from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) and MiniBooNE experiments, with a combined statistical significance of 6.1 sigma. However, these results are still controversial due to the absence of a consistent explanation within the Standard Model of particle physics.

Long-baseline experiments, mainly from accelerator-based neutrino experiments such as MINOS and T2K, show no evidence of light sterile neutrinos. These experiments set limits on the mixing angle of sterile neutrinos with active neutrinos, and the latest results have improved sensitivity to the so-called ""low-energy excess"" observed by the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments. An interesting observation is the tension between the results from short- and long-baseline experiments, which hints at new physics beyond the Standard Model.

The recent result from the DANSS experiment, using compact detectors, claims to have observed a hint of a sterile neutrino signal. However, this result is not yet confirmed by other experiments. Many other experiments are also looking for signals of light sterile neutrinos and will provide new results in the near future, including the SBN program and the upcoming DUNE experiment.

In summary, the existence of light sterile neutrinos is still an open question in the field of particle physics. The controversies surrounding the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments call for more experimental efforts, while the lack of evidence from long-baseline experiments imposes strict limits on the parameter space of sterile neutrinos. The observation of such a particle will have far-reaching implications for the current understanding of fundamental physics. Therefore, a continued and coordinated effort involving both long- and short-baseline experiments is required to make progress towards resolving the mystery of light sterile neutrinos.","(388, 16)","We review the status of searches for sterile neutrinos in the $\sim 1$ eV range,
which are motivated by anomalies in short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.

MicroBooNE has reported no evidence for sterile neutrino oscillations
in their search for electron neutrino appearance in an antineutrino beam.
PROSPECT has set limits on sterile neutrino mixing using reactor antineutrinos.

With the growing importance of corporate viral marketing campaigns on online social networks, the interest
","With the growing importance of corporate viral marketing campaigns on online social networks, the interest in studies of influence propagation through networks is higher than ever. In a viral marketing campaign, a firm initially targets a small set of pioneers and hopes that they would influence a sizeable fraction of the population by diffusion of influence through the network. In general, any marketing campaign might fail to go viral in the first try. As such, it would be useful to have some guide to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign and judge whether it is worthy of further resources, and in case the campaign has potential, how to hit upon a good pioneer who can make the campaign go viral. In this paper, we present a diffusion model developed by enriching the generalized random graph (a.k.a. configuration model) to provide insight into these questions. We offer the intuition behind the results on this model, rigorously proved in Blaszczyszyn & Gaurav(2013), and illustrate them here by taking examples of random networks having prototypical degree distributions - Poisson degree distribution, which is commonly used as a kind of benchmark, and Power Law degree distribution, which is normally used to approximate the real-world networks. On these networks, the members are assumed to have varying attitudes towards propagating the information. We analyze three cases, in particular - (1) Bernoulli transmissions, when a member influences each of its friend with probability p; (2) Node percolation, when a member influences all its friends with probability p and none with probability 1-p; (3) Coupon-collector transmissions, when a member randomly selects one of his friends K times with replacement. We assume that the configuration model is the closest approximation of a large online social network, when the information available about the network is very limited. The key insight offered by this study from a firm's perspective is regarding how to evaluate the effectiveness of a marketing campaign and do cost-benefit analysis by collecting relevant statistical data from the pioneers it selects. The campaign evaluation criterion is informed by the observation that if the parameters of the underlying network and the campaign effectiveness are such that the campaign can indeed reach a significant fraction of the population, then the set of good pioneers also forms a significant fraction of the population. Therefore, in such a case, the firms can even adopt the naive strategy of repeatedly picking and targeting some number of pioneers at random from the population. With this strategy, the probability of them picking a good pioneer will increase geometrically fast with the number of tries.","(479, 14)","Social networks play a crucial role in disseminating information, shaping opinions and behaviors, and propagating influence. Identifying the pioneers of influence propagation in social networks has been the subject of intense research in the past decade. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the seminal works and major contributions in the field of influence propagation in social networks.

We start by introducing the concept of influence and its different forms, such as social influence, informational influence, and normative influence. Then, we discuss the main models and algorithms used to quantify and predict influence propagation in social networks, including traditional network-based models such as Independent Cascade, Linear Threshold, and Generalized Linear Threshold, as well as more recent data-driven approaches such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Next, we review the most influential works in the field, highlighting their theoretical foundations, main contributions, and empirical evaluations. We divide the literature into three periods: the early period (before 2007), the middle period (2008-2013), and the recent period (2014-present). In each period, we identify the pioneers who made significant and lasting contributions to the field and discuss their works in detail.

In the early period, the pioneers focused mainly on developing models and algorithms for influence propagation, such as the seminal work by Kempe et al. (2003) on the Independent Cascade model and the work by Domingos and Richardson (2001) on the Markov Random Field model. In the middle period, the pioneers expanded the scope of the field by investigating various applications of influence propagation, such as viral marketing, political campaigns, and social movements, and by addressing new challenges such as privacy, security, and scalability. Examples of works by pioneers in this period include the work by Leskovec et al. (2007) on the influence maximization problem and the work by Anagnostopoulos et al. (2008) on the cost-effective viral marketing.

In the recent period, the pioneers shifted towards more data-driven approaches, leveraging the abundance of social media data and the recent advances in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Examples of works by pioneers in this period include the work by Banerjee et al. (2019) on using Deep Learning for predicting political influence and the work by Cui et al. (2019) on using Graph Neural Networks for modeling influence propagation.

Finally, we conclude by discussing some open challenges and future directions in the field of influence propagation in social networks, such as understanding the interplay between influence and homophily, dealing with misinformation and polarization, and accounting for dynamic and heterogeneous networks.","(488, 19)","With the growing importance of corporate viral marketing campaigns on online social networks, the interest
in understanding the dynamics of influence propagation has been increasing. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research on influence propagation in social networks. We first
introduce the basic concepts and terminologies related to influence propagation. Then, we provide a detailed
overview of the existing models and algorithms for influence propagation. Finally, we discuss the challenges
and future research directions in this area. Our goal is to provide a solid foundation for researchers and
practitioners who are interested in studying and applying influence propagation techniques in social networks.
Influence propagation refers to the process by which information, opinions, or behaviors spread through a
social network. It is a fundamental phenomenon that underlies many important applications, such as viral
marketing, product recommendation, opinion formation, and epidemic control. Understanding how and why
influence propagates in social networks is crucial for designing effective and efficient strategies for these
applications. However, influence propagation is a complex and dynamic process that is affected by various
factors, such as network structure, user behavior, and external events. Therefore, modeling and analyzing
influence propagation is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms
and principles.
In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature on influence propagation
in social networks. We start by introducing the basic concepts and definitions related to influence
propagation, such as nodes, edges, paths, cascades, seeds, thresholds, and probabilities. We then present a
taxonomy of the existing models for influence propagation, which can be classified into three categories:
static models, dynamic models, and hybrid models. Static models assume that the network structure and the
influence probabilities are fixed and do not change over time. Dynamic models allow for changes in the
network structure or the influence probabilities over time. Hybrid models combine both static and dynamic
aspects of influence propagation. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of each model category.
Next, we review some of the most popular algorithms for influence propagation, such as independent cascade
model (ICM), linear threshold model (LTM), degree discount model (DDM), and weighted cascade model (WCM).
We explain how these algorithms work and how they differ from each other in terms of assumptions, inputs,
outputs, and complexity. We also compare their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.
Finally, we identify some of the key challenges and future research directions in the field of influence
propagation in social networks.","(488, 22)",,

During recent years, the renaissance of neural networks as the major machine learning paradigm and
","During recent years, the renaissance of neural networks as the major machine learning paradigm and more specifically, the confirmation that deep learning techniques provide state-of-the-art results for most of computer vision tasks has been shaking up traditional research in image processing. The same can be said for research in communities working on applied harmonic analysis, information geometry, variational methods, etc. For many researchers, this is viewed as an existential threat. On the one hand, research funding agencies privilege mainstream approaches especially when these are unquestionably suitable for solving real problems and for making progress on artificial intelligence. On the other hand, successful publishing of research in our communities is becoming almost exclusively based on a quantitative improvement of the accuracy of any benchmark task. As most of my colleagues sharing this research field, I am confronted with the dilemma of continuing to invest my time and intellectual effort on mathematical morphology as my driving force for research, or simply focussing on how to use deep learning and contributing to it. The solution is not obvious to any of us since our research is not fundamental, it is just oriented to solve challenging problems, which can be more or less theoretical. Certainly, it would be foolish for anyone to claim that deep learning is insignificant or to think that one's favourite image processing domain is productive enough to ignore the state-of-the-art. I fully understand that the labs and leading people in image processing communities have been shifting their research to almost exclusively focus on deep learning techniques. My own position is different: I do think there is room for progress on mathematically grounded image processing branches, under the condition that these are rethought in a broader sense from the deep learning paradigm. Indeed, I firmly believe that the convergence between mathematical morphology and the computation methods which gravitate around deep learning (fully connected networks, convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, recurrent neural networks, etc.) is worthwhile. The goal of this talk is to discuss my personal vision regarding these potential interactions. Without any pretension of being exhaustive, I want to address it with a series of open questions, covering a wide range of specificities of morphological operators and representations, which could be tackled and revisited under the paradigm of deep learning. An expected benefit of such convergence between morphology and deep learning is a cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between both fields. In addition, I think the future answer to some of these questions can provide some insight on understanding, interpreting and simplifying deep learning networks.","(469, 16)","In recent years, deep learning algorithms have become increasingly prevalent in a variety of fields ranging from computer vision to natural language processing. While deep learning has achieved remarkable success, there remain fundamental questions about how these models work and represent information. In particular, important questions still remain regarding the use of morphological operators in deep learning, and how they are able to represent complex shapes and structures.

Morphological operators are mathematical tools often used for image processing and analysis. This includes operations such as dilation, erosion, and opening and closing. These operations fundamentally transform the shape of an object, which makes them extremely useful for tasks such as image segmentation and object recognition. In the context of deep learning, morphological operations can be used as a building block for various architectures, such as morphological neural networks.

Despite the potential usefulness of morphological operators, several open questions remain regarding their use in deep learning. One important question is how morphological operators should be designed and integrated into deep learning models to achieve optimal performance. Another important question is how morphological operators can be used in conjunction with other deep learning tools such as convolutional neural networks.

Additionally, there remain open questions about how morphological operators can be used to represent complex shapes and structures. One approach is to represent objects as a set of morphological features, such as size and shape, and use these features to train a deep learning model. Another approach is to design deep learning models capable of directly manipulating and generating morphological representations of objects.

Despite the remaining open questions, recent research has shown promising results in using morphological operators in deep learning. For example, some studies have shown that incorporating morphological operations into neural networks can improve performance on tasks such as object detection and segmentation. Additionally, research on morphological neural networks has shown that they can achieve state-of-the-art results on certain image processing tasks.

In conclusion, while deep learning has achieved remarkable success, there remain important open questions about how morphological operators and representations can be used in conjunction with deep learning models. These questions have important implications for a variety of applications, such as image processing, object recognition, and natural language processing. Ongoing research in this area is likely to lead to new insights and techniques for incorporating morphological features into deep learning models.","(431, 19)","During recent years, the renaissance of neural networks as the major machine learning paradigm and
the emergence of deep learning techniques have led to significant advances in many areas of computer
vision. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.
However, despite their success, CNNs still suffer from several limitations. One of the main issues is
that they require a large amount of labeled data for training, which can be expensive and time-
consuming to obtain. Another limitation is that CNNs are prone to overfitting, which can lead to poor
generalization performance on unseen data. Finally, CNNs are computationally intensive, making them
difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address these limitations by combining CNNs with
morphological operators and representations. Morphological operators are a set of mathematical
operations that can be applied to images to extract structural information. For example, the erosion
operator can be used to remove small details from an image, while the dilation operator can be used to
add small details to an image. Morphological representations, on the other hand, are a way of
representing images using morphological operators. For example, a morphological representation of an
image can be obtained by applying a series of erosion and dilation operations to the image.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the task of image classification.
Specifically, we use a CNN to extract features from an image, and then apply morphological operators
to these features to obtain a morphological representation. We show that this representation can be
used to improve the performance of the CNN, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
We also show that our approach can be extended to other tasks such as object detection and semantic
segmentation.

representations can lead to significant improvements in the performance of deep learning models. We

that our work will inspire further research in this area.","(405, 17)",,

In the context of unconstraint numerical optimization, this paper investigates the global linear convergence of
","In the context of unconstraint numerical optimization, this paper investigates the global linear convergence of a simple probabilistic derivative-free optimization algorithm (DFO). The algorithm samples a candidate solution from a standard multivariate normal distribution scaled by a step-size and centered in the current solution. This solution is accepted if it has a better objective function value than the current one. Crucial to the algorithm is the adaptation of the step-size that is done in order to maintain a certain probability of success. The algorithm, already proposed in the 60's, is a generalization of the well-known Rechenberg's $(1+1)$ Evolution Strategy (ES) with one-fifth success rule which was also proposed by Devroye under the name compound random search or by Schumer and Steiglitz under the name step-size adaptive random search. In addition to be derivative-free, the algorithm is function-value-free: it exploits the objective function only through comparisons. It belongs to the class of comparison-based step-size adaptive randomized search (CB-SARS). For the convergence analysis, we follow the methodology developed in a companion paper for investigating linear convergence of CB-SARS: by exploiting invariance properties of the algorithm, we turn the study of global linear convergence on scaling-invariant functions into the study of the stability of an underlying normalized Markov chain (MC). We hence prove global linear convergence by studying the stability (irreducibility, recurrence, positivity, geometric ergodicity) of the normalized MC associated to the $(1+1)$-ES. More precisely, we prove that starting from any initial solution and any step-size, linear convergence with probability one and in expectation occurs. Our proof holds on unimodal functions that are the composite of strictly increasing functions by positively homogeneous functions with degree $\alpha$ (assumed also to be continuously differentiable). This function class includes composite of norm functions but also non-quasi convex functions. Because of the composition by a strictly increasing function, it includes non continuous functions. We find that a sufficient condition for global linear convergence is the step-size increase on linear functions, a condition typically satisfied for standard parameter choices. While introduced more than 40 years ago, we provide here the first proof of global linear convergence for the $(1+1)$-ES with generalized one-fifth success rule and the first proof of linear convergence for a CB-SARS on such a class of functions that includes non-quasi convex and non-continuous functions. Our proof also holds on functions where linear convergence of some CB-SARS was previously proven, namely convex-quadratic functions (including the well-know sphere function).","(467, 16)","This paper considers the problem of optimizing a class of positively homogeneous functions using a comparison-based step-size adaptive randomized search algorithm. Specifically, we investigate the performance of the (1+1) evolutionary strategy with the generalized one-fifth success rule on this task. We demonstrate that under certain assumptions on the problem structure, the algorithm exhibits linear convergence to the optimum. Our analysis is based on a novel potential function approach which allows us to establish convergence bounds that hold with high probability. The potential function is constructed by introducing an auxiliary sequence which measures the expected improvement in the objective function as the algorithm progresses. We show that this sequence satisfies a recursive equation that can be used to derive upper bounds on the expected value of the potential function. By choosing appropriate parameters for the algorithm, we prove that the potential function converges to zero at a linear rate. This in turn implies linear convergence of the algorithm to the optimum. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments on a benchmark set of test functions. Our results show that the (1+1) evolutionary strategy with the generalized one-fifth success rule achieves significantly faster convergence rates compared to standard (1+1) evolutionary strategies without adaptive step sizes. Moreover, our method is shown to be competitive with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms on these test functions. Overall, our work provides new insights into the behaviour of randomized search algorithms on a class of structured optimization problems, and establishes a theoretical foundation for developing improved algorithms for a wide range of practical applications.","(283, 12)","In the context of unconstraint numerical optimization, this paper investigates the global linear convergence of
the (1 + 1) evolutionary strategy (ES) with generalized one-fifth success rule (GOSR) when applied to
positively homogeneous functions (PHFs). The GOSR is a comparison-based step-size adaptive randomized
search algorithm that updates the step-size based on the number of successful trials. PHFs are a class of
functions that satisfy the property f(λx) = λf(x) for all x ∈ Rn and λ > 0. The main contribution of this paper
is to establish the global linear convergence rate of the GOSR when applied to PHFs.
The paper begins by introducing the notation and definitions used throughout the paper. The authors define
the GOSR as an iterative algorithm that generates a sequence of points {xk}∞ k=0 ⊂ Rn starting from an
initial point x0 ∈ Rn. At each iteration k, the GOSR generates a candidate point yk = xk + σkzk, where
σk is the step-size and zk is a random vector drawn from a probability distribution. The step-size σk is then
updated based on the outcome of the comparison between f(yk) and f(xk). If f(yk) < f(xk), the step-size is
decreased by a factor of 0.5; otherwise, it is increased by a factor of c, where c > 1 is a parameter of the
algorithm. The authors also introduce the concept of PHFs and provide examples of such functions.
The main result of the paper is Theorem 1, which states that under certain conditions, the sequence {xk}
generated by the GOSR converges to a global minimizer of f at a linear rate. Specifically, the authors show
that if f is a PHF and the initial step-size σ0 is sufficiently small, then there exists a constant C > 0 such
that ||xk+1 − x*|| ≤ C||xk − x*|| for all k ≥ 0, where x* is the global minimizer. The proof of Theorem 1
relies on the properties of PHFs and the fact that the GOSR updates the step-size in a comparison-based
manner. The authors also provide a numerical example to illustrate the theoretical results.
In conclusion, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of unconstrained numerical
optimization by providing a global linear convergence rate for the GOSR","(436, 15)",,

Background: Odd-odd nuclei, around doubly closed shells, have been extensively used to study proton-neutron interactions.
","Background: Odd-odd nuclei, around doubly closed shells, have been extensively used to study proton-neutron interactions. However, the evolution of these interactions as a function of the binding energy, ultimately when nuclei become unbound, is poorly known. The $^{26}$F nucleus, composed of a deeply bound $\pi0d\_{5/2}$ proton and an unbound $\nu0d\_{3/2}$ neutron on top of an $^{24}$O core, is particularly adapted for this purpose. The coupling of this proton and neutron results in a $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 - 4^{+}\_1$ multiplet, whose energies must be determined to study the influence of the proximity of the continuum on the corresponding proton-neutron interaction. The $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1, 2^{+}\_1,4^{+}\_1$ bound states have been determined, and only a clear identification of the $J^{\pi} =3^{+}\_1$ is missing.Purpose: We wish to complete the study of the $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 - 4^{+}\_1$ multiplet in $^{26}$F, by studying the energy and width of the $J^{\pi} =3^{+}\_1$ unbound state. The method was firstly validated by the study of unbound states in $^{25}$F, for which resonances were already observed in a previous experiment.Method: Radioactive beams of $^{26}$Ne and $^{27}$Ne, produced at about $440A$\,MeV by the FRagment Separator at the GSI facility, were used to populate unbound states in $^{25}$F and $^{26}$F via one-proton knockout reactions on a CH$\_2$ target, located at the object focal point of the R$^3$B/LAND setup. The detection of emitted $\gamma$-rays and neutrons, added to the reconstruction of the momentum vector of the $A-1$ nuclei, allowed the determination of the energy of three unbound states in $^{25}$F and two in $^{26}$F. Results: Based on its width and decay properties, the first unbound state in $^{25}$F is proposed to be a $J^{\pi} = 1/2^-$ arising from a $p\_{1/2}$ proton-hole state. In $^{26}$F, the first resonance at 323(33)~keV is proposed to be the $J^{\pi} =3^{+}\_1$ member of the $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 - 4^{+}\_1$ multiplet. Energies of observed states in $^{25,26}$F have been compared to calculations using the independent-particle shell model, a phenomenological shell-model, and the ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group method.Conclusions: The deduced effective proton-neutron interaction is weakened by about 30-40\% in comparison to the models, pointing to the need of implementing the role of the continuum in theoretical descriptions, or to a wrong determination of the atomic mass of $^{26}$F.","(619, 10)","The study of the proton-neutron interaction near the drip line has been of great interest in the field of nuclear physics. In this research paper, we investigate the effective interaction between protons and neutrons in the unbound states of the nuclides $^{25,26}$F.

Using the state-of-the-art experimental facilities at the m separator of the RIBF accelerator complex at RIKEN, we have successfully measured the energy levels and decay properties of $^{25,26}$F. Our results reveal a weakly bound d$_{5/2}$ neutron in $^{25}$F and a resonant p$_{3/2}$ proton in $^{26}$F, which are the key components for an effective interaction in these nuclei.

By analyzing the experimental data using the ab initio coupled-cluster theory, we have been able to extract the effective interaction between the protons and neutrons in $^{25,26}$F. Our calculations show that the effective interaction is strongly influenced by the presence of the unbound states near the drip line.

Furthermore, our results indicate that the effective interaction between the protons and neutrons in $^{26}$F is significantly enhanced compared to that in $^{25}$F. This suggests that the proton-neutron interaction near the drip line is highly dependent on the specific properties of the nuclide, and highlights the importance of studying the drip line region in nuclear physics.

In conclusion, this research paper presents a comprehensive study of the effective interaction between protons and neutrons near the drip line in $^{25,26}$F. Our experimental and theoretical results provide valuable insights into the nuclear properties of these nuclides, and shed light on the nature of the proton-neutron interaction in the drip line region.","(334, 10)","Background: Odd-odd nuclei, around doubly closed shells, have been extensively used to study proton-neutron interactions.
However, little is known about odd-odd nuclei near the drip line due to their short half-lives.
Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the effective proton-neutron interaction in odd-odd fluorine isotopes near the drip line using unbound states.
Methodology: The experiment was conducted at the Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) in RIKEN, Japan.
A secondary beam of $^{24}$F was produced by fragmentation of a primary beam of $^{48}$Ca on a $^{9}$Be target.
The unbound states of $^{25}$F and $^{26}$F were populated through one-neutron knockout reactions.
The decay energies and widths of the unbound states were measured using the BigRIPS spectrometer and the SAMURAI spectrometer.
Findings: The experimental results show that the unbound states are located at excitation energies of 1.5 MeV and 2.5 MeV for $^{25}$ F and $^{26} $F, respectively.
The widths of the unbounded states are found to be 0.3 MeV and 0.5 MeV, respectively.
Implications: The experimental results suggest that the effective protonneutron interaction is weak near the drip line.
This finding has important implications for our understanding of nuclear structure and reactions near the drip line.","(261, 11)",,

The e-learning systems are designed to provide an easy and constant access to educational resources
","The e-learning systems are designed to provide an easy and constant access to educational resources online. Indeed, E-learning systems have capacity to adapt content and learning process according to the learner profile. Adaptation techniques using advanced behavioral analysis mechanisms, called ""Learner Modeling"" or ""Profiling"". The latter require continuous tracking of the activities of the learner to identify gaps and strengths in order to tailor content to their specific needs or advise and accompany him during his apprenticeship. However, the disadvantage of these systems is that they cause learners' discouragement, for learners, alone with his screen loses its motivation to improve. Adding social extension to learning, to avoid isolation of learners and boost support and interaction between members of the learning community, was able to increase learner's motivation. However, the tools to facilitate social interactions integrated to E-learning platforms can be used for purposes other than learning. These needs, which can be educational, professional or personal, create a mixture of data from the private life and public life of learners. With the integration of these tools for e-learning systems and the growth of the amount of personal data stored in the databases of these latter, protecting the privacy of students becomes a major concern.

Indeed, the exchange of profiles between e-learning systems is done without the permission of their owners. Furthermore, the profiling behavior analysis currently represents a very cost-effective way to generate profits by selling these profiles advertising companies. Today, the right to privacy is threatened from all sides. In addition to the threat from pirates, the source of the most dangerous threats is that from service providers online that users devote a blind trust. Control and centralized data storage and access privileges that have suppliers are responsible for the threat. Our work is limited to the protection of personal data in e-learning systems. We try to answer the question: How can we design a system that protects the privacy of users against threats from the provider while benefiting from all the services, including analysis of behavior? In the absence of solutions that take into account the protection and respect of privacy in e-learning systems that integrate social learning tools, we designed our own solution. Our ""ApprAide"" system uses a set of protocols based on security techniques to protect users' privacy. In addition, our system incorporates tools that promote social interactions as a social learning network, a chat tool and a virtual table. Our solution allows the use of adaptation techniques and profiling to assist learners. Keywords: Social learning, privacy, security, e-learning, agents","(478, 21)","The protection of privacy is an important issue in online education environments, where personal information and sensitive data are at risk of being exposed to unauthorized parties. In this paper, we propose a new approach to privacy protection based on the use of intelligent agents in e-learning systems.

Our method involves the deployment of agents that interact with users and monitor their activities, detecting potential threats and taking corrective actions as needed. These agents are designed to be autonomous and adaptive, capable of learning from user behavior and adjusting their strategies accordingly. The approach is based on a hierarchical model of privacy levels that takes into account the sensitivity of different types of data and the rights of users to control the flow of information.

We apply this method to a prototype e-learning system and evaluate its effectiveness through a series of experiments and user surveys. Our results show that the use of intelligent agents can significantly improve privacy protection in e-learning environments, providing users with greater control over their personal information and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The proposed approach has several advantages over traditional methods of privacy protection. It is more flexible and adaptive, able to respond quickly to changing threats and user needs. It also reduces the burden on system administrators, who can delegate many tasks to the intelligent agents. Finally, it is more transparent and user-friendly, providing clear and understandable feedback to users about the protection of their privacy.

We conclude that the use of intelligent agents in e-learning systems offers a promising new approach to privacy protection, one that takes advantage of advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Further research is needed to explore the potential of this approach in other contexts, and to address the technical and ethical challenges that arise in the deployment of intelligent agents for privacy protection.","(332, 13)","The e-learning systems are designed to provide an easy and constant access to educational resources

The fundamental plane of early-type galaxies is a rather tight three-parameter correlation discovered more than
","The fundamental plane of early-type galaxies is a rather tight three-parameter correlation discovered more than twenty years ago. It has resisted a both global and precise physical interpretation despite a consequent number of works, observational, theoretical or using numerical simulations. It appears that its precise properties depend on the population of galaxies in study. Instead of selecting a priori these populations, we propose to objectively construct homologous populations from multivariate analyses. We have undertaken multivariate cluster and cladistic analyses of a sample of 56 low-redshift galaxy clusters containing 699 early-type galaxies, using four parameters: effective radius, velocity dispersion, surface brightness averaged over effective radius, and Mg2 index. All our analyses are consistent with seven groups that define separate regions on the global fundamental plane, not across its thickness. In fact, each group shows its own fundamental plane, which is more loosely defined for less diversified groups. We conclude that the global fundamental plane is not a bent surface, but made of a collection of several groups characterizing several fundamental planes with different thicknesses and orientations in the parameter space. Our diversification scenario probably indicates that the level of diversity is linked to the number and the nature of transforming events and that the fundamental plane is the result of several transforming events. We also show that our classification, not the fundamental planes, is universal within our redshift range (0.007 - 0.053). We find that the three groups with the thinnest fundamental planes presumably formed through dissipative (wet) mergers. In one of them, this(ese) merger(s) must have been quite ancient because of the relatively low metallicity of its galaxies, Two of these groups have subsequently undergone dry mergers to increase their masses. In the k-space, the third one clearly occupies the region where bulges (of lenticular or spiral galaxies) lie and might also have formed through minor mergers and accretions. The two least diversified groups probably did not form by major mergers and must have been strongly affected by interactions, some of the gas in the objects of one of these groups having possibly been swept out. The interpretation, based on specific assembly histories of galaxies of our seven groups, shows that they are truly homologous. They were obtained directly from several observables, thus independently of any a priori classification. The diversification scenario relating these groups does not depend on models or numerical simulations, but is objectively provided by the cladistic analysis. Consequently, our classification is more easily compared to models and numerical simulations, and our work can be readily repeated with additional observables.","(477, 18)","The fundamental plane is a well-known empirical relationship that links the luminosity, the size, and the velocity dispersion of early-type galaxies. Despite the existence of this correlation for more than two decades, its physical origin remains an open question. Thanks to deep multi-band imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, and extensive stellar population analysis, we present new insights into the fundamental plane and its underlying structures. Using a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Keck observatories, we found evidence for the presence of structural deviations from the fundamental plane, which we interpret as orthogonally-oriented, disk-like structures embedded within the spheroidal component. We argue that these structures result from recent or ongoing gas accretion, and could provide fuel for both central supermassive black holes and galactic star formation. Interestingly, our results suggest that these structures are ubiquitous in early-type galaxies across a wide range of masses, luminosities, and environments, which implies that they carry fundamental information that cannot be neglected in theories of galaxy formation and evolution.

To further investigate these deviations from the fundamental plane, we used a robust statistical framework to derive quantitative measurements of their orientation, geometry, and amplitude. We found that the disk-like structures are typically flat and have a thickness that is only a few percent of the galaxies' effective radii. Their orientation distribution deviates significantly from random, indicating that they are truly aligned with the plane of the sky rather than being randomly oriented with respect to the line of sight. We found a strong correlation between the amplitude of the structure and the age of the galaxy's stellar population, with older galaxies having weaker or absent structures. This suggests that the disks dissipate over time, leaving behind a more spheroidal, ""classical"" morphology.

Our findings have important implications for the understanding of early-type galaxy formation and evolution. They provide new evidence for the role of gas accretion in shaping the structures and kinematics of these galaxies and suggest that the traditional view of early-type galaxies as purely spheroidal systems needs to be revisited. We anticipate that these results will inspire new theoretical models and numerical simulations that aim to account for the formation and evolution of these intriguing structures within the broader framework of galaxy formation.","(413, 14)","The fundamental plane of early-type galaxies is a rather tight three-parameter correlation discovered more than
30 years ago. It relates the effective radius (R_e), surface brightness (I_e) and central velocity dispersion
(sigma_0) of elliptical galaxies. The discovery of the fundamental plane has had a profound impact on our
understanding of the formation and evolution of early-type galaxies. In this paper, we present a new analysis
of the fundamental plane using a large sample of early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
We find that the slope of the fundamental plane is consistent with previous studies, but the zero-point is
significantly different. We also find that the scatter in the fundamental plane is smaller than previously

This article is dedicated to the late Giorgio Israel. R{\'e}sum{\'e}. The aim of this article
","This article is dedicated to the late Giorgio Israel. R{\'e}sum{\'e}. The aim of this article is to propose on the one hand a brief history of modeling starting from the works of Fibonacci, Robert Malthus, Pierre Francis Verhulst and then Vito Volterra and, on the other hand, to present the main hypotheses of the very famous but very little known predator-prey model elaborated in the 1920s by Volterra in order to solve a problem posed by his son-in-law, Umberto D'Ancona. It is thus shown that, contrary to a widely-held notion, Volterra's model is realistic and his seminal work laid the groundwork for modern population dynamics and mathematical ecology, including seasonality, migration, pollution and more. 1. A short history of modeling 1.1. The Malthusian model.

If the rst scientic view of population growth seems to be that of Leonardo Fibonacci [2], also called Leonardo of Pisa, whose famous sequence of numbers was presented in his Liber abaci (1202) as a solution to a population growth problem, the modern foundations of population dynamics clearly date from Thomas Robert Malthus [20]. Considering an ideal population consisting of a single homogeneous animal species, that is, neglecting the variations in age, size and any periodicity for birth or mortality, and which lives alone in an invariable environment or coexists with other species without any direct or indirect inuence, he founded in 1798, with his celebrated claim Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio, the paradigm of exponential growth. This consists in assuming that the increase of the number N (t) of individuals of this population, during a short interval of time, is proportional to N (t). This translates to the following dierential equation : (1) dN (t) dt = $\epsilon$N (t) where $\epsilon$ is a constant factor of proportionality that represents the growth coe-cient or growth rate. By integrating (1) we obtain the law of exponential growth or law of Malthusian growth (see Fig. 1). This law, which does not take into account the limits imposed by the environment on growth and which is in disagreement with the actual facts, had a profound inuence on Charles Darwin's work on natural selection. Indeed, Darwin [1] founded the idea of survival of the ttest on the 1. According to Frontier and Pichod-Viale [3] the correct terminology should be population kinetics, since the interaction between species cannot be represented by forces. 2. A population is dened as the set of individuals of the same species living on the same territory and able to reproduce among themselves.","(508, 18)","The predator-prey model is a common framework for analyzing the population dynamics of interacting species. The model originated from Vito Volterra's seminal work in 1926. In this paper, we investigate a paradoxical behavior of Volterra's model that has puzzled researchers for decades. On one hand, the model predicts that predator and prey populations should oscillate around a stable equilibrium. This prediction has been supported by empirical evidence from many different ecosystems. On the other hand, the model also predicts that predator and prey populations can exhibit chaotic behavior under certain parameter regimes. This prediction contradicts the intuition that ecosystems are stable and predictable.

Our research addresses the following questions: why does the predator-prey model exhibit chaotic behavior, and what are the implications of this paradox for understanding ecosystem dynamics? To answer these questions, we use mathematical techniques from the field of dynamical systems theory. We show that the chaotic behavior of the predator-prey model arises from a phenomenon known as ""strange attractors."" Strange attractors are complex patterns in phase space that result from the nonlinearity of the model equations. These patterns are characteristic of chaotic systems and underlie the unpredictable behavior of the model.

Despite the chaotic behavior of the predator-prey model, we find that it is still a useful framework for understanding ecosystem dynamics. In particular, the model can capture the idea of ""ecosystem resilience,"" which refers to the ability of a system to recover from disturbances. We show that ecosystems with chaotic dynamics can be more resilient than those with stable dynamics. This finding has implications for conservation biology and ecosystem management, as it suggests that efforts to stabilize ecosystems may be counterproductive.

In conclusion, our research sheds light on the paradoxical behavior of the predator-prey model and its implications for understanding ecosystem dynamics. We show that the chaotic behavior of the model arises from strange attractors and that it can have positive implications for ecosystem resilience. Our findings suggest that the predator-prey model remains a valuable tool for ecologists and conservationists, even in the face of nonlinear and unpredictable dynamics.","(380, 19)","This article is dedicated to the late Giorgio Israel.

begin by discussing Israel's early life and education, and then move on to his groundbreaking
work in the field of dynamical systems. Finally, we will conclude with a discussion of
Israel's legacy and his impact on the field of mathematics.
Giorgio Israel was born in Rome, Italy, in 1929. He received his undergraduate degree
from the University of Rome in 1951, and then went on to earn his Ph.D. from the same
university in 1955. After completing his doctorate, Israel spent several years as a postdoctoral
fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked
with some of the most prominent mathematicians of the time, including John von Neumann
and Stanislaw Ulam. In 1960, Israel returned to Italy to take up a position as a professor
at the University of Rome, where he remained for the rest of his career.
Israel's early work focused on the theory of differential equations, but he soon became
interested in the more general area of dynamical systems theory. In particular, he was
drawn to the work of the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, who had developed
a new approach to the study of dynamical systems that was based on the idea of invariant
manifolds. Israel was one of the first mathematicians to recognize the potential of this
new approach, and he quickly became one of the leading experts in the field.
One of Israel's most important contributions to dynamical systems theory was his work
on the theory of attractors. An attractor is a set of points in a dynamical system that are
attracted to each other over time. Israel showed that attractors could be used to describe
the long-term behavior of a dynamical system, and he developed a number of powerful
techniques for studying them. His work on attractors has had a lasting impact on the field,
and his ideas continue to be used by researchers today.
In addition to his work on attractors, Israel also made important contributions to the
theory of bifurcations. A bifurcation is a sudden change in the behavior of","(461, 19)",,

Roughly, Cartan and followers have not been able to "" quotient down to the base manifold "", a result only obtained by Spencer in 1970 through the ""nonlinear Spencer sequence"" but in a way quite different from the one followed by Vessiot in 1903 for the same purpose and still ignored. 2) JANET VERSUS SPENCER: The "" Ricci tensor "" only depends on the nonlinear transformations (called "" elations "" by Cartan in 1922) that describe the ""difference "" existing between the Weyl group (10 parameters of the Poincar\'e subgroup + 1 dilatation) and the conformal group of space-time (15 parameters). It can be defined by a canonical splitting, that is to say without using the indices leading to the standard contraction or trace of the Riemann tensor. Meanwhile, we shall obtain the number of components of the Riemann and Weyl tensors without any combinatoric argument on the exchange of indices. Accordingly, the Spencer sequence for the conformal Killing system and its formal adjoint fully describe the Cosserat/Maxwell/Weyl theory but General Relativity is not coherent at all with this result. 3) ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS: Contrary to other equations of physics (Cauchy equations, Cosserat equations, Maxwell equations), the Einstein equations cannot be "" parametrized "", that is the generic solution cannot be expressed by means of the derivatives of a certain number of arbitrary potential-like functions, solving therefore negatively a 1000 $ challenge proposed by J. Wheeler in 1970. Accordingly, the mathematical foundations of mathematical physics must be revisited within this formal framework, though striking it may look like for certain apparently well established theories such as electromagnetism and general relativity. We insist on the fact that the arguments presented are of a purely mathematical nature and are thus unavoidable.","(502, 13)","The theory of general relativity is one of the most significant scientific discoveries of modern times. It is a beautiful and elegant theory that describes the universe and the laws of gravity in a way that no other theory has been able to do. However, despite its success, there are still questions that remain unanswered about the mathematical foundations on which it is built.

In this paper, we revisit the mathematical foundations of general relativity and explore the areas where there are gaps in our understanding. We begin by reviewing the fundamental principles of the theory and the mathematical equations used to describe the behavior of matter and energy in the presence of gravity. We then look at the limitations of the current mathematical framework and explore how these limitations have led researchers to develop new approaches to modeling relativistic systems.

One of the key areas where our understanding of the mathematical foundations of general relativity is lacking is in the area of singularities. Singularities are points in space-time where the equations used to describe the behavior of matter and energy become infinite. While singularities are predicted by general relativity, it is unclear what they mean physically and whether they represent a fundamental limitation of the theory.

Another area where we need to improve our understanding of the mathematical foundations of general relativity is in the description of black holes. Black holes are regions of space-time where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Our current model of black holes depends on the presence of singularities, and it is unclear how they can be described mathematically without the use of singularities.

Despite these limitations, general relativity remains one of the most successful theories in physics and has been instrumental in our understanding of the universe. However, as scientists continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge, it is essential that we revisit the mathematical foundations of general relativity and explore new approaches that can help us better understand the universe around us. This paper aims to contribute to this ongoing effort and provide new insights into the mathematical foundations of one of the most fundamental theories in physics.","(387, 15)","The purpose of this paper is to present for the first time an elementary summary
of the mathematical foundations of Einstein's theory of general relativity. The
paper begins with a brief overview of the historical development of the theory,
followed by a more detailed discussion of the mathematical formalism underlying
the theory. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the
theory for our understanding of the nature of space and time.
The mathematical formalism of general relativity is based on the principle of
equivalence, which states that the laws of physics are the same in all
inertial frames of reference. This principle was first proposed by Einstein in
his 1905 paper on special relativity, and it forms the basis for the theory of
general relativity. In general relativity, the principle of equivalence is
extended to include the effects of gravity, which are described by the
Einstein field equations.
The Einstein field equations are a set of nonlinear partial differential
equations that describe the curvature of spacetime in terms of the distribution
of matter and energy in the universe. The equations are highly complex and
difficult to solve, but they provide a powerful tool for understanding the
nature of gravity and the structure of the universe.
One of the most important implications of general relativity for our
understanding of the universe is the prediction of black holes. A black hole is
a region of spacetime where the gravitational force is so strong that nothing,
not even light, can escape from it. Black holes are predicted to form when a
massive star collapses under its own gravity, and they are thought to be
responsible for some of the most extreme phenomena in the universe, such as
quasars and gamma-ray bursts.
Another important implication of general relativity concerns the expansion of
the universe. According to the theory, the universe is expanding at an
accelerating rate, due to the presence of dark energy. Dark energy is a
mysterious form of energy that makes up about 70% of the universe, and it is
thought to be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe.
In conclusion, general relativity provides a powerful framework for
understanding the nature of space, time, and gravity. The theory has led to
many important predictions, including the existence of black holes and the
expansion of the universe. Despite its complexity, general relativity remains
one of the most successful theories in physics, and it continues to inspire
further research into the nature of the universe.","(454, 17)",,

","Recently Wilson [Ann. Appl. Probab. 14 (2004) 274--325] introduced an important new technique for lower bounding the mixing time of a Markov chain.

In this paper we extend Wilson's technique to find lower bounds of the correct order for card shuffling Markov chains where at each time step a random card is picked and put at the top of the deck. Two classes of such shuffles are addressed, one where the probability that a given card is picked at a given time step depends on its identity, the so-called move-to-front scheme, and one where it depends on its position. For the move-to-front scheme, a test function that is a combination of several different eigenvectors of the transition matrix is used. A general method for finding and using such a test function, under a natural negative dependence condition, is introduced. It is shown that the correct order of the mixing time is given by the biased coupon collector's problem corresponding to the move-to-front scheme at hand. For the second class, a version of Wilson's technique for complex-valued eigenvalues/eigenvectors is used. Such variants were presented in [Random Walks and Geometry (2004) 515--532] and [Electron. Comm. Probab. 8 (2003) 77--85].

Here we present another such variant which seems to be the most natural one for this particular class of problems. To find the eigenvalues for the general case of the second class of problems is difficult, so we restrict attention to two special cases. In the first case the card that is moved to the top is picked uniformly at random from the bottom $k=k(n)=o(n)$ cards, and we find the lower bound $(n^3/(4\pi^2k(k-1)))\log n$. Via a coupling, an upper bound exceeding this by only a factor 4 is found. This generalizes Wilson's [Electron. Comm.

Probab. 8 (2003) 77--85] result on the Rudvalis shuffle and Goel's [Ann. Appl.

Probab. 16 (2006) 30--55] result on top-to-bottom shuffles. In the second case the card moved to the top is, with probability 1/2, the bottom card and with probability 1/2, the card at position $n-k$. Here the lower bound is again of order $(n^3/k^2)\log n$, but in this case this does not seem to be tight unless $k=O(1)$. What the correct order of mixing is in this case is an open question.

We show that when $k=n/2$, it is at least $\Theta(n^2)$.","(503, 29)","Biased random-to-top shuffling refers to a popular method to randomize a given sequence of elements. The method proceeds as follows: for each element in the sequence, choose a random number, and then place the element at the top of the sequence if the random number is greater than a certain threshold. The threshold is typically set to a fixed value or calculated based on some statistical measure of the sequence.

Despite its simplicity and widespread usage, the biased random-to-top shuffling method has received little attention in the literature. This is partly due to the fact that it is difficult to analyze and understand the behavior of the method. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of biased random-to-top shuffling, focusing on the following aspects:

- The statistical properties of the shuffled sequence.

- The computational complexity of the method, including its time and space requirements.

- The sensitivity of the method to the choice of threshold value and random number generator.

- The effectiveness of the method in preserving certain structures and properties of the input sequence, such as order, periodicity, and statistical distribution.

To achieve these goals, we conduct a series of experiments and simulations on various types of sequences, including random, structured, and real-world data sets. We analyze the results using statistical and visualization techniques, and provide insights into the behavior and performance of biased random-to-top shuffling.

Our main findings are as follows. Firstly, biased random-to-top shuffling tends to produce sequences that are more uniform and less correlated than the input sequence, especially when the threshold value is close to 0.5. This property can be useful in many applications that require randomization or sampling from a given sequence. Secondly, the computational complexity of the method is linear in the size of the sequence, but can be reduced by using appropriate data structures and algorithms. Thirdly, the choice of threshold value and random number generator can have a significant impact on the quality and randomness of the shuffled sequence, and should be carefully selected based on the application requirements. Finally, biased random-to-top shuffling is more effective in preserving certain structures and properties of the input sequence than other shuffling methods, such as random, fisher-yates, and block shuffling.

In conclusion, biased random-to-top shuffling is a simple and efficient method to randomize a given sequence, and has many interesting properties and applications. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of this method, and can serve as a basis for further research and development in this area.","(463, 19)","Recently Wilson [Ann. Appl. Probab. 14 (2004) 274--325] introduced an important new technique for lower
bounding the mixing time of a Markov chain on a finite state space. In this paper, we apply Wilson's

of the random-to-top shuffle studied by Diaconis and Shahshahani [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 3 (1990) 665--688].
We show that the mixing time of this shuffle is $\Theta(n^2 \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of cards in
the deck. This improves upon the previous best known bound of $O(n^2 \sqrt{\log n})$ due to Diaconis and
Saloff-Coste [Probab. Theory Related Fields 102 (1995) 251--267]. Our result also implies that the
random-to-top shuffle mixes in $O(n \log n)$ steps, improving upon the previously best known bound of
$O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ due to Aldous and Diaconis [SIAM J. Comput. 18 (1989) 1054--1076].","(219, 13)",,

Scaling temporal dynamics in functional MRI (fMRI) signals have been evidenced for a decade as
","Scaling temporal dynamics in functional MRI (fMRI) signals have been evidenced for a decade as intrinsic characteristics of ongoing brain activity (Zarahn et al., 1997). Recently, scaling properties were shown to fluctuate across brain networks and to be modulated between rest and task (He, 2011): notably, Hurst exponent, quantifying long memory, decreases under task in activating and deactivating brain regions. In most cases, such results were obtained: First, from univariate (voxelwise or regionwise) analysis, hence focusing on specific cognitive systems such as Resting-State Networks (RSNs) and raising the issue of the specificity of this scale-free dynamics modulation in RSNs. Second, using analysis tools designed to measure a single scaling exponent related to the second order statistics of the data, thus relying on models that either implicitly or explicitly assume Gaussianity and (asymptotic) self-similarity, while fMRI signals may significantly depart from those either of those two assumptions (Ciuciu et al., 2008; Wink et al., 2008). To address these issues, the present contribution elaborates on the analysis of the scaling properties of fMRI temporal dynamics by proposing two significant variations. First, scaling properties are technically investigated using the recently introduced Wavelet Leader-based Multifractal formalism (WLMF; Wendt et al., 2007). This measures a collection of scaling exponents, thus enables a richer and more versatile description of scale invariance (beyond correlation and Gaussianity), referred to as multifractality. Also, it benefits from improved estimation performance compared to tools previously used in the literature. Second, scaling properties are investigated in both RSN and non-RSN structures (e.g., artifacts), at a broader spatial scale than the voxel one, using a multivariate approach, namely the Multi-Subject Dictionary Learning (MSDL) algorithm (Varoquaux et al., 2011) that produces a set of spatial components that appear more sparse than their Independent Component Analysis (ICA) counterpart. These tools are combined and applied to a fMRI dataset comprising 12 subjects with resting-state and activation runs (Sadaghiani et al., 2009). Results stemming from those analysis confirm the already reported task-related decrease of long memory in functional networks, but also show that it occurs in artifacts, thus making this feature not specific to functional networks. Further, results indicate that most fMRI signals appear multifractal at rest except in non-cortical regions. Task-related modulation of multifractality appears only significant in functional networks and thus can be considered as the key property disentangling functional networks from artifacts. These finding are discussed in the light of the recent literature reporting scaling dynamics of EEG microstate sequences at rest and addressing non-stationarity issues in temporally independent fMRI modes.","(493, 14)","The study investigated the time dynamics of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals during rest and task using scale-free and multifractal analysis. We hypothesized that the temporal patterns of fMRI signals would exhibit scale-free and multifractal properties, and that these properties would differ between resting-state and task-related fMRI data.

To test our hypothesis, we analyzed fMRI data obtained from healthy participants during both resting-state and task conditions. The fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using standard procedures, including voxel-wise signal detrending, band-pass filtering, and spatial smoothing.

Our results revealed that the fMRI signals during both resting-state and task conditions exhibited scale-free and multifractal properties, indicating that these signals exhibit complex temporal properties across a wide range of timescales. Moreover, we found that the properties of these signals differed between resting-state and task-related fMRI data. Specifically, the scale-free and multifractal indices were higher in resting-state fMRI data than in task-related fMRI data, suggesting that the temporal dynamics of fMRI signals may be more complex during rest than during task performance.

These findings have important implications for our understanding of brain function and suggest that the temporal dynamics of fMRI signals are shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In particular, our results suggest that the temporal properties of brain activity during rest and task may differ in important ways, and that these differences may reflect changes in the underlying neural processes that are active in these different states.

In summary, our study provides new insights into the scale-free and multifractal time dynamics of fMRI signals during rest and task, and sheds light on the complex patterns of brain activity that underlie cognitive function. Our findings have important implications for the development of new methods for the analysis of fMRI data, and may ultimately contribute to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for neurological and psychiatric disorders.","(334, 11)","Scaling temporal dynamics in functional MRI (fMRI) signals have been evidenced for a decade as
scale-free and multifractal. However, it is still unclear whether the scaling properties of fMRI signals
during rest and task are similar or different. In this study, we investigated the scaling properties of
fMRI signals during rest and task using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and multifractal
spectral analysis (MSA). The results showed that the scaling exponents of fMRI signals during rest
and task were significantly different (p < 0.05), indicating that the temporal dynamics of fMRI
signals during rest and task had different scaling properties. Furthermore, the scaling exponents
of fMRI signals during task were higher than those during rest, suggesting that the temporal
dynamics of fMRI signals were more complex during task than during rest. These findings provide
new insights into the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fMRI signals and may have
implications for the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases.","(176, 6)",,

We present new ATCA 21-cm line observations of the neutral hydrogen in the nearby radio
","We present new ATCA 21-cm line observations of the neutral hydrogen in the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A. We image in detail (with a resolution down to 7"", ~100pc) the distribution of HI along the dust lane. Our data have better velocity resolution and better sensitivity than previous observations. The HI extends for a total of ~15kpc. The data, combined with a titled-ring model of the disk, allow to conclude that the kinematics of the HI is that of a regularly rotating, highly warped structure down to the nuclear scale. The parameters (in particular the inclination) of our model are somewhat different from some of the previously proposed models but consistent with what was recently derived from stellar light in a central ring. The model nicely describes also the morphology of the dust lane as observed with Spitzer. There are no indications that large-scale anomalies in the kinematics exist that could be related to supplying material for the AGN. Large-scale radial motions do exist, but these are only present at larger radii r>6kpc). This unsettled gas is mainly part of a tail/arm like structure. The relatively regular kinematics of the gas in this structure suggests that it is in the process of settling down into the main disk. The presence of this structure further supports the merger/interaction origin of the HI in Cen A. From the structure and kinematics we estimate a timescale of 1.6-3.2*10^{8}yr since the merging event. No bar structure is needed to describe the kinematics of the HI. The comparison of the timescale derived from the large-scale HI structure and those of the radio structure together with the relative regularity of the HI down to the sub-kpc regions does not suggest a one-to-one correspondence between the merger and the phase of radio activity. Interestingly, the radial motions of the outer regions are such that the projected velocities are redshifted compared to the regular orbits. This means that the blueshifted absorption discovered earlier and discussed in our previous paper cannot be caused by out-moving gas at large radius projected onto the centre. Therefore, the interpretation of the blueshifted absorption, together with at least a fraction of the redshifted nuclear absorption, as evidence for a regular inner disk, still holds. Finally, we also report the discovery of two unresolved clouds detected at 5.2 and 11kpc away (in projection) from the HI disk. They are likely an other example of left-over of the merger that brought the HI gas.","(457, 20)","The galaxy Centaurus A has long been a subject of interest for astronomers studying its morphology and kinematics. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the atomic hydrogen component of this galaxy using high-resolution data obtained from the Australia Telescope Compact Array.

Our observations reveal a complex structure for the neutral hydrogen gas in Centaurus A, with several distinct features that offer insight into the galaxy's formation and evolution. The most prominent of these features is a large-scale disk-like structure with a diameter of approximately 40 kpc, which is aligned with the optical disk of the galaxy. This disk is tilted with respect to the plane of the sky, which suggests it is not in a state of equilibrium.

In addition to the large-scale disk, we also observe several other structures that appear to be connected to it. These include two prominent spiral arms, as well as several filaments and loops. We propose that these structures may be the result of interactions between the galaxy and its environment, possibly including past mergers or interactions with nearby galaxies.

To further explore the kinematics of the atomic hydrogen in Centaurus A, we have analyzed the velocity field of the gas. Our results indicate that the velocity field is highly asymmetric, with significant deviations from a simple rotational pattern. Specifically, we observe large-scale warping and twisting of the velocity contours, which suggests the presence of non-circular motions.

We interpret these kinematic features as the result of ongoing interactions between the gas in Centaurus A and a surrounding medium, such as a hot halo or a tidal stream. We speculate that the interactions may be driving gas inflows toward the central regions of the galaxy, which could fuel the activity of the supermassive black hole at its core.

Overall, our observations of the atomic hydrogen in Centaurus A offer a detailed view of the morphology and kinematics of this complex galaxy. Our results provide new insights into the formation and evolution of Centaurus A, as well as the role of gas interactions in shaping the properties of galaxies more generally.","(379, 15)","We present new ATCA 21-cm line observations of the neutral hydrogen in the nearby radio

imaged using the MIRIAD software package. The final image has a resolution of 10 arcsec
and a noise level of 0.5 mJy/beam. We find that the neutral hydrogen in Centaurus A is
distributed in a ring-like structure with a diameter of about 50 kpc. The ring has a
thickness of about 10 kpc and is located at a distance of about 100 kpc from the center
of the galaxy. The ring is rotating around the center of the galaxy with a velocity of
about 200 km/s. The rotation curve of the ring is approximately flat, with a maximum
velocity of about 300 km/s. We also find that the ring is surrounded by a halo of
neutral hydrogen with a radius of about 150 kpc. The halo has a thickness of about 30
kpc and a velocity dispersion of about 100 km/s. The halo is likely to be the result of
the interaction between Centaurus A and its companion galaxy NGC 5128B.","(221, 11)",,

Language-oriented modularity (LOM) is a methodology that complements language-oriented programming (LOP) in providing on-demand language
","Language-oriented modularity (LOM) is a methodology that complements language-oriented programming (LOP) in providing on-demand language abstraction solutions during software development. It involves the implementation and immediate utilization of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that are also aspect-oriented (DSALs). However, while DSL development is affordable thanks to modern language workbenches, DSAL development lacks similar tool support.

Consequently, LOM is often impractical and underutilized. The challenge we address is making the complexity of DSAL implementation comparable to that of DSLs and the effectiveness of programming with DSALs comparable to that of general-purpose aspect languages (GPALs). Today, despite being essentially both domain-specific and aspect-oriented, DSALs seem to be second-class. Aspect development tools (e.g., AJDT) do not work on DSAL code. DSL development tools like language workbenches (e.g., Spoofax) neither deal with the backend weaving nor handle the composition of DSALs. DSAL composition frameworks (e.g., Awesome) do not provide frontend development tools. DSAL code transformation approaches (e.g., XAspects) do not preserve the semantics of DSAL programs in the presence of other aspect languages. We extend AspectJ with a small set of annotations and interfaces that allows DSAL designers to define a semantic-preserving transformation to AspectJ and interface with AspectJ tools.

Our transformation approach enables the use of standard language workbench to implement DSALs and use of standard aspect development tools to program with those DSALs. As a result, DSALs regain first-class status with respect to both DSLs and aspect languages. This, on the one hand, lowers the cost of developing DSALs to the level of DSLs and, on the other hand, raises the effectiveness of using a DSAL to the level of a GPAL. Consequently, LOM becomes cost-effective compared to the LOP baseline. We modified the ajc compiler to support our approach. Using two different language workbenches (Spoofax and Xtext) we then implemented several DSALs. AspectJ was supported out-of-the-box. We implemented Cool to demonstrate that the non-trivial composition of AspectJ and Cool can be accommodated using our approach. We applied LOM to crosscutting concerns in two open source projects (oVirt and muCommander), implementing in the process application-specific DSALs, thus providing a sense of the decrease in the cost of developing composable DSALs and the increase in the effectiveness of programming with them. Crosscutting concerns remain a problem in modern real-world projects (e.g., as observed in oVirt). DSALs are often the right tool for addressing these concerns. Our work makes LOM practical, thus facilitating use of DSAL solutions in the software development process.","(472, 23)","Modularity is an essential concept in computer science and software engineering, which promotes code organization, maintenance, and reuse. Considering the development of programming languages, the idea of modularity has become increasingly important due to its effect on code comprehension, scalability, and evolution. This paper aims to explore the intersection between modularity and language design, specifically by investigating Language Oriented Modularity (LOM) – a modularization principle that focuses on identifying and composing language constructs as reusable modules, which serve as the basic building blocks for larger-scale languages.

The first part of the paper outlines the theoretical foundation of LOM and its guiding principles. We describe the key elements of LOM, including modular syntax, semantic aspects, and the way it interacts with various programming paradigms. Additionally, the paper discusses how LOM helps developers to achieve a more flexible and efficient language design, better tailored to specific domains and user needs.

The second part of the paper provides an in-depth examination of practical aspects related to LOM in software development environments, including tool support, case studies, and real-world applications. We examine how LOM promotes better code reuse through language composition techniques such as meta-programming, language embedding, and domain-specific languages. We also discuss how LOM can address several challenges faced by software developers today, including software complexity, code generation, and language interoperability.

The paper concludes by highlighting the potential benefits of LOM for the software development community, including greater language extensibility, better code quality, and increased productivity. Moreover, the paper outlines some of the challenges and future directions of LOM, such as addressing issues related to language compatibility, providing adequate tool support and ensuring community participation in the development of modular languages.

In summary, this paper provides an overview of the Language Oriented Modularity principle, its theoretical foundation, and practical applications. Using examples and case studies, this paper demonstrates how LOM can fundamentally change the way programming languages are designed, implemented and maintained by enabling more flexible, consistent, and modular language construction. Ultimately, LOM holds great promise for improving software development and enhancing the overall quality and sustainability of software systems.","(398, 14)","Language-oriented modularity (LOM) is a methodology that complements language-oriented programming (LOP) in providing on-demand language
modularity. LOM is based on the idea that languages can be decomposed into smaller, more manageable components, which can then be combined to form larger, more complex languages. This approach allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in language design, as well as improved maintainability and reusability of language components. In this paper, we will explore the theoretical foundations of LOM, as well as its practical applications in language design and implementation. We will also discuss some of the challenges and limitations of LOM, and propose some potential future directions for research in this area.
LOM is based on the principle of modularity, which states that a complex system can be more easily understood and modified if it is broken down into smaller, simpler components. In the context of language design, modularity refers to the ability to decompose a language into smaller, reusable components, such as syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. These components can then be combined in different ways to create new languages, or to modify existing languages.
One of the key advantages of LOM is that it allows for greater flexibility in language design. By decomposing a language into smaller components, it becomes easier to experiment with different combinations of these components, and to create new languages that are tailored to specific use cases. This can be particularly useful in domains where there is a need for rapid prototyping and iteration, such as in software development or natural language processing.
Another advantage of LOM is improved maintainability and reuse of language components. By breaking a language down into smaller, modular components, it becomes much easier to identify and fix bugs, as well as to share and reuse language components across different projects. This can lead to significant improvements in productivity and efficiency, as well as reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies in language design.
However, there are also some challenges and limitations associated with LOM. One of the main challenges is the complexity of language design, which can make it difficult to identify and decompose language components in a way that is both effective and efficient. Another challenge is the need for specialized tools and infrastructure to support LOM, which can be costly and time-consuming to develop and maintain.
Despite these challenges, LOM has the potential to revolutionize the way we design and implement languages. By providing a more flexible and adaptable approach to language design, LOM can help us to create languages that are better suited to specific use cases, and that are easier to maintain and reuse over time. In the future, we can expect to see continued research and development in this area","(504, 20)",,

Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity) that would yield the required ~10% reduction in size for the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions are found: the usual main sequence solution for the star yields for the planet a mass of 3.67+/-0.13 Mjup, a radius of 1.55+/-0.03 Rjup for an age that is at least 130Ma, and should be less than 500Ma given the star's fast rotation and significant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main sequence, in which case the planet's mass is 3.45\pm 0.27 Mjup, its radius is 1.50+/-0.06 Rjup for an age between 30 and 40 Ma. These extremely young solutions provide the simplest explanation for the planet's size which can then be matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state, provided the atmospheric opacities are increased by a factor ~3 compared to usual assumptions for solar compositions atmospheres. Other solutions imply in any case that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the result of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago: a giant impact with another Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system which caused a significant rise of the eccentricity followed by the rapid circularization of its orbit. Conclusions: Additional observations of CoRoT-2 that could help understanding this system include searches for infrared excess and the presence of a debris disk and searches for additional companions. The determination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and secondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's atmospheric properties and to determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a manner less vulnerable to systematic errors due to stellar activity.","(444, 12)","The CoRoT-2 system is a target of great interest in exoplanet research, due to the young age of its host star, and the presence of an inflated giant planet. Our study presents a detailed analysis of this system, using data gathered by various instruments and techniques.

The host star, CoRoT-2, is a moderately active, young K-dwarf with a rotation period of 4.5 days, which is consistent with the presence of starspots on its surface. We identify several such spots using photometric variability and Doppler imaging, including a persistent spot at a high latitude which may be associated with a polar spot.

The giant planet, CoRoT-2b, is a highly inflated gas-giant with a radius of about 1.5 times that of Jupiter. Its mass and radius suggest a low density and a significant amount of hydrogen and helium in its atmosphere. We model the planet's structure and derive constraints on its composition and thermal structure. We also investigate the possibility of tidal heating as a source of internal energy.

We find that the spot distribution on the star is consistent with the expected pattern of a young, rapidly rotating star, with spots concentrated at high latitudes. The polar spot appears to be stable over time, which may be linked to the planet's close-in orbit and significant tidal forces.

We also investigate the dynamical evolution of the system, and the stability of the planet's orbit over long timescales. We find that the planet's current orbit is unlikely to be stable over the age of the system, and that it may have migrated inward from a more distant location. We discuss the possible processes that could have caused such migration, including planet-planet interactions, disk-planet interactions, and secular perturbations.

Overall, our study provides a detailed analysis of the CoRoT-2 system, which sheds light on the processes involved in the formation and evolution of giant planets around young stars. The young age of the system, and the presence of a highly inflated planet, make it a valuable target for further study with upcoming space telescopes, such as JWST and ARIEL.","(386, 15)","Context: CoRoT-2b is one of the most anomalously large exoplanet known. Given its large mass,
it is expected to have a short orbital period. However, it has an orbital period of 1.74 days,
which is much longer than expected. This suggests that the planet may be in a highly eccentric
orbit, which could explain its anomalously large size. The goal of this study is to analyze the
CoRoT-2 planetary system in order to determine the cause of the planet's anomalously large size.
Methodology: We used data from the CoRoT satellite to measure the planet's orbital period and
eccentricity. We also used data from ground-based telescopes to measure the star's age and
luminosity. We then used these measurements to calculate the planet's mass and radius.
Findings: We found that the planet has a mass of 3.9 Earth masses and a radius of 1.5 Earth
radii. This is much larger than expected for a planet of its mass. We also found that the
planet's orbit is highly eccentric, with an eccentricity of 0.4. This is consistent with the
planet being in a highly eccentric orbit.
Implications: Our findings suggest that the anomalously large size of the planet is due to its
highly eccentric orbit. The high eccentricity of the orbit causes the planet to spend most of its
time close to the star, where it is heated by the star's radiation. This heating causes the planet
to expand, resulting in its anomalously large radius. Our findings also suggest that the star is
younger than previously thought, which could explain why the planet is still in a highly
eccentric orbit.","(301, 16)",,

Fermi can measure the spectral properties of gamma-ray bursts over a very large energy range
","Fermi can measure the spectral properties of gamma-ray bursts over a very large energy range and is opening a new window on the prompt emission of these energetic events. Localizations by the instruments on Fermi in combination with follow-up by Swift provide accurate positions for observations at longer wavelengths leading to the determination of redshifts, the true energy budget, host galaxy properties and facilitate comparison with pre-Fermi bursts.

Multi-wavelength follow-up observations were performed on the afterglows of four bursts with high energy emission detected by Fermi/LAT : GRB090323, GRB090328, GRB090510 and GRB090902B. They were obtained in the optical/near-infrared bands with GROND mounted at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope and additionally of GRB090323 in the optical with the 2 m telescope in Tautenburg, Germany. Three of the events are classified as long bursts while GRB090510 is a well localized short GRB with GeV emission. In addition, host galaxies were detected for three of the four bursts. Spectroscopic follow-up was initiated with the VLT for GRB090328 and GRB090510. The afterglow observations in 7 bands are presented for all bursts and their host galaxies are investigated. Knowledge of the distance and the local dust extinction enables comparison of the afterglows of LAT-detected GRBs with the general sample. The spectroscopic redshifts of GRB090328 and GRB090510 were determined to be z=0.7354+/-0.0003 and z=0.903 +/- 0.001 and dust corrected star-formation rates of 4.8 Mdot yr^-1 and 0.60 M_dot yr^-1 were derived for their host galaxies, respectively. The afterglows of long bursts exhibit power-law decay indices alpha from less than 1 to ~2.3 and spectral indices (beta) values from 0.65 to ~1.2 which are fairly standard for GRB afterglows. Constraints are placed on the jet half opening angles of less than 2.1 deg to greater than 6.4 deg which allows limits to be placed on the beaming corrected energies. These range from less than 5x10^50 erg to the one of the highest values ever recorded, greater than 2.2x10^52 erg for GRB090902B, and are not consistent with a standard candle. The extremely energetic long Fermi bursts have optical afterglows which lie in the top half of the brightness distribution of all optical afterglows detected in the Swift era or even in the top 5% if incompleteness is considered. The properties of the host galaxies of these LAT detected bursts in terms of extinction, star formation rates and masses do not appear to differ from previous samples.","(425, 15)","This paper presents the results of optical and near-infrared follow-up observations of four gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and their associated afterglows. The observations were conducted to determine the redshifts of the bursts, study their afterglows, estimate their energetics, and investigate their host galaxies.

Our observations revealed the redshifts of the four GRBs, ranging from 0.25 to 1.3. The afterglows of the bursts were detected and monitored in the optical and near-infrared wavelengths, with their light curves analyzed to constrain the physical parameters of the GRB jets and the properties of their circumburst environments.

We found that the bursts had isotropic equivalent energies in the range of 10^50 to 10^52 ergs, indicating that they were among the most energetic cosmic explosions. The properties of the afterglows suggested they appeared to be consistent with the relativistic blast wave model, with the exception of one burst that showed unusual features.

Our study also probed the host galaxies of the GRBs, deriving their morphological types, star formation rates, and stellar masses. We found that the galaxies were typically faint and blue, consistent with the population of star-forming galaxies at high redshifts, and some showed evidence of ongoing star formation.

Overall, our observations and analyses have provided valuable insights into the properties of these four Fermi/LAT GRBs and their host galaxies. They demonstrate the importance of multi-wavelength follow-up observations to fully understand the physics behind these enigmatic cosmic explosions.","(268, 10)","Fermi can measure the spectral properties of gamma-ray bursts over a very large energy range

During a survey for stars with disks in the Taurus star-forming region using the Spitzer
","During a survey for stars with disks in the Taurus star-forming region using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have discovered a pair of young brown dwarfs, FU Tau A and B, in the Barnard 215 dark cloud. They have a projected angular separation of 5.7"", corresponding to 800 AU at the distance of Taurus. To assess the nature of these two objects, we have obtained spectra of them and have constructed their spectral energy distributions. Both sources are young (~1 Myr) according to their Halpha emission, gravity-sensitive spectral features, and mid-IR excess emission. The proper motion of FU Tau A provides additional evidence of its membership in Taurus. We measure spectral types of M7.25 and M9.25 for FU Tau A and B, respectively, which correspond to masses of ~0.05 and ~0.015 M\cdot according to the evolutionary models of Chabrier and Baraffe. FU Tau A is significantly overluminous relative to an isochrone passing through FU Tau B and relative to other members of Taurus near its spectral type, which may indicate that it is an unresolved binary. FU Tau A and B are likely to be components of a binary system based on the low probability (~3x10^-4) that Taurus would produce two unrelated brown dwarfs with a projected separation of a </- 6"". Barnard 215 contains only one other young star and is in a remote area of Taurus, making FU Tau A and B the first spectroscopically-confirmed brown dwarfs discovered forming in isolation rather than in a stellar cluster or aggregate. Because they were born in isolation and comprise a weakly bound binary, dynamical interactions with stars could not have played a role in their formation, and thus are not essential for the birth of brown dwarfs. ERRATUM: The K-band magnitude for FU Tau B in Table 1 is incorrect and should be 13.33. The bolometric luminosity of FU Tau B in Table 3 and Figure 5 is incorrect because of that mistake and a separate arithmetic error. The correct value of the luminosity is 0.0039 Lsun. FU Tau A and B exhibited different isochronal ages in the original Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in Figure 5, which was unexpected for members of a binary system. This discrepancy is reduced in the corrected version of Figure 5 since both objects are now above the isochrone for 1 Myr. Given the large uncertainties in model isochrones at such young ages, the positions of FU Tau A and B in Figure 5 could be roughly consistent with coevality.","(452, 16)","This study presents the discovery of a wide binary brown dwarf that was born in isolation. The object was found in the field of the Taurus star-forming region, and is unique in that it is located far from any known star-forming regions or clusters.

The brown dwarf was identified through multi-epoch imaging data obtained from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and the Gemini Observatory. The observations revealed that the object has a separation of 320 AU from its companion, which is also a brown dwarf.

Further analysis of the available data indicates that the two brown dwarfs have a projected physical separation of approximately 800 AU, which suggests that they were formed together and have been drifting apart since their birth. The estimated age of the brown dwarfs is around 10 million years.

The objects’ spectra were obtained using the Gemini North Telescope, and their spectral types were determined to be L4 and L5.5, respectively. Additional observations were conducted using the Keck Observatory, which yielded high-resolution spectra that provided characterization of the brown dwarfs’ atmospheric properties, such as metallicity, gravity, and effective temperature.

Based on the available data, the researchers speculate that the brown dwarfs were formed through a physical fragmentation process during the early stages of star formation, and were later ejected from their natal environment due to gravitational interactions with other newly formed stars or brown dwarfs.

The discovery of this wide binary brown dwarf is important for the understanding of the formation and evolution of objects that are not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion in their cores. This finding shows that brown dwarfs can be formed in isolation, far from any known star-forming regions or clusters, highlighting the importance of conducting wide-field surveys to increase our knowledge of these elusive objects.

The study also provides opportunities for further investigation of the atmospheric properties of the brown dwarfs. Future studies may reveal more detailed information on the evolution of these objects, which could have important implications for the understanding of the evolution of star and planet formation in our galaxy.

In conclusion, the discovery of a wide binary brown dwarf born in isolation provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of non-stellar objects, and underscores the importance of conducting wide-field surveys to uncover new and unique astronomical phenomena.","(415, 14)","During a survey for stars with disks in the Taurus star-forming region using the Spitzer

In the present paper I formulate a framework that accommodates many unambiguous discrimination problems. I
","In the present paper I formulate a framework that accommodates many unambiguous discrimination problems. I show that the prior information about any type of constituent (state, channel, or observable) allows us to reformulate the discrimination among finite number of alternatives as the discrimination among finite number of average constituents. Using this framework I solve several unambiguous tasks. I present a solution to optimal unambiguous comparison of two ensembles of unknown quantum states. I consider two cases: 1) The two unknown states are arbitrary pure states of qudits. 2) Alternatively, they are coherent states of single-mode optical fields. For this case I propose simple and optimal experimental setup composed of beam-splitters and a photodetector. As a second tasks I consider an unambiguous identification (UI) of coherent states. In this task identical quantum systems are prepared in coherent states and labeled as unknown and reference states, respectively. The promise is that one reference state is the same as the unknown state and the task is to find out unambiguously which one it is. The particular choice of the reference states is unknown to us, and only the probability distribution describing this choice is known. In a general case when multiple copies of unknown and reference states are available I propose a scheme consisting of beamsplitters and photodetectors that is optimal within linear optics. UI can be considered as a search in a quantum database, whose elements are the reference states and the query is represented by the unknown state. This perspective motivated me to show that reference states can be recovered after the measurement and might be used (with reduced success rate) in subsequent UI.

Moreover, I analyze the influence of noise in preparation of coherent states on the performance of the proposed setup. Another problem I address is the unambiguous comparison of a pair of unknown qudit unitary channels. I characterize all solutions and identify the optimal ones. I prove that in optimal experiments for comparison of unitary channels the entanglement is necessary. The last task I studied is the unambiguous comparison of unknown non-degenerate projective measurements. I distinguish between measurement devices with apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases only the difference of the measurements can be concluded unambiguously. For the labeled case I derive the optimal strategy if each unknown measurement is used only once. However, if the apparatuses are not labeled, then each measurement device must be used (at least) twice. In particular, for qubit measurement apparatuses with unlabeled outcomes I derive the optimal test state in the two-shots scenario.","(468, 24)","The concept of unambiguous measurements in quantum theory has been a subject of intense investigation over the past few decades. The basic idea behind unambiguous measurements is to determine the outcome of a quantum measurement without any ambiguity or error. In other words, it involves distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states with certainty, without destroying these states or introducing any uncertainty in the measurement.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the theory of unambiguous measurements in quantum systems. We begin by introducing the underlying mathematical framework and the associated mathematical notation used in the literature. This includes the notion of projective measurements, POVMs (positive operator valued measures), and the resulting measurement operators that play a crucial role in the theory of unambiguous measurements. We then move on to discuss the main results and findings in the field, highlighting the key theoretical and experimental advances that have been made in recent years.

One central theme that emerges from our review is the importance of understanding the relationship between unambiguous measurements and other concepts of quantum measurement theory. For example, we discuss how unambiguous measurements can be used to obtain more precise information about quantum states, how they relate to other entropic measures such as the von Neumann entropy and the quantum mutual information, and how they can be used to define new measures of non-classicality in quantum systems.

Another important aspect of unambiguous measurements is their relationship to other areas of quantum information science, such as quantum cryptography and quantum communication. We explore some of the key connections between these fields, providing a unified framework for understanding the role of unambiguous measurements in broader quantum information protocols.

Finally, we conclude by discussing some future directions for research in the field of unambiguous measurements. This includes new theoretical developments, such as the study of multi-partite unambiguous measurements and the relationship between unambiguous measurements and quantum error correction. We also highlight some of the key experimental challenges that remain to be addressed in the quest for more precise and accurate quantum measurements.

Overall, our review provides a comprehensive overview of the theory of unambiguous measurements in quantum systems, highlighting the key theoretical and experimental advances that have been made in recent years. We believe that this work will be of interest to physicists and other researchers working in the field of quantum information science, as well as to those interested in the deeper conceptual foundations of quantum theory.","(440, 16)","In the present paper I formulate a framework that accommodates many unambiguous discrimination problems.

introduce the notion of an unambiguous measurement, which is a generalization of the notion of a projective
measurement. An unambiguous measurement is a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) that satisfies certain
conditions. I show that any unambiguous measurement can be represented as a convex combination of projective
measurements. I also show that any POVM can be decomposed into a convex combination of unambiguous
measurements. Finally, I discuss some applications of unambiguous measurements in quantum information
processing.

Shock modelling predicts an electron density enhancement within the magnetic precursor of C-shocks. Previous observations
","Shock modelling predicts an electron density enhancement within the magnetic precursor of C-shocks. Previous observations of SiO, H13CO+, HN13C and H13CN toward the young L1448-mm outflow showed an over-excitation of the ion fluid that was attributed to an electron density enhancement in the precursor. We re-visit this interpretation and test if it still holds when we consider different source morphologies and kinetic temperatures for the observed molecules, and also give some insight on the spatial extent of the electron density enhancement around L1448-mm.

We estimate the opacities of H13CO+ and HN13C by observing the J=3\to2 lines of rarer isotopologues to confirm that the emission is optically thin. To model the excitation of the molecules, we use the large velocity gradient (LVG) approximation with updated collisional coefficients to i) re- analyse the observations toward the positions where the over-excitation of H13CO+ has previously been observed [i.e. toward L1448- mm at offsets (0,0) and (0,-10)], and ii) to investigate if the electron density enhancement is still required for the cases of extended and compact emission, and for kinetic temperatures of up to 400 K. We also report several lines of SiO, HN13C and H13CO+ toward new positions around this outflow, to investigate the spatial extent of the over-excitation of the ions in L1448-mm. From the isotopologue observations, we find that the emission of H13CO+ and HN13C from the precursor is optically thin if this emission is extended. Using the new collisional coefficients, an electron density enhancement is still needed to explain the excitation of H13CO+ for extended emission and for gas temperatures of\le 400 K toward L1448-mm (0,-10), and possibly also toward L1448-mm (0,0). For compact emission the data cannot be fitted. We do not find any evidence for the over-excitation of the ion fluid toward the newly observed positions around L1448-mm.

The observed line emission of SiO, H13CO+ and HN13C toward L1448-mm (0,0) and (0,-10) is consistent with an electron density enhancement in the precursor component, if this emission is spatially extended. This is also true for the case of high gas temperatures (\le400 K) toward the (0,-10) offset. The electron density enhancement seems to be restricted to the southern, redshifted lobe of the L1448-mm outflow. Interferometric images of the line emission of these molecules are needed to confirm the spatial extent of the over-excitation of the ions and thus, of the electron density enhancement in the magnetic precursor of L1448-mm.","(460, 14)","This study aims to investigate the differences in excitations between ionized and neutral fluids in the magnetic precursor of L1448-mm, a young stellar object. Our observations reveal that the ionized fluid exhibits a high degree of excitation within the magnetic precursor, while the neutral fluid shows lower levels of excitation. This discrepancy suggests that ionized and neutral fluids experience different excitation mechanisms.

We utilized cutting-edge observational techniques, including Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Very Large Array (VLA), to examine the spectral energy distribution of the magnetic precursor. Our measurements provide insight into the molecular composition of the precursor environment, with detailed information about the spectral lines emitted by various molecules.

Our analysis uncovered several significant findings, including the identification of complex organic molecules in the magnetic precursor, such as methanol and formamide. Additionally, we established the presence of magnetic fields in the precursor, which are responsible for producing the observed anisotropic emission. These magnetic fields likely play a critical role in the excitation and ionization of fluids within the precursor.

Our results have several important implications for our understanding of young stellar objects, particularly in relation to the formation and evolution of magnetic fields. The differences in excitation mechanisms between ionized and neutral fluids suggest that magnetic fields may influence the ionization state of fluids within protostellar environments. Further research in this area may shed light on the complex physical processes that govern the evolution of young stellar objects.

Overall, our study offers a significant contribution to the field of astrophysics by providing new insights into the magnetic precursor of L1448-mm.

Bioinformatic data sources available on the web are multiple and heterogenous. The lack of documentation
",Bioinformatic data sources available on the web are multiple and heterogenous. The lack of documentation and the difficulty of interaction with these data sources require users competence in both informatics and biological fields for an optimal use of sources contents that remain rather under exploited. In this paper we present an approach based on formal concept analysis to classify and search relevant bioinformatic data sources for a given query. It consists in building the concept lattice from the binary relation between bioinformatic data sources and their associated metadata. The concept built from a given query is then merged into the concept lattice. The result is given by the extraction of the set of sources belonging to the extents of the query concept subsumers in the resulting concept lattice. The sources ranking is given by the concept specificity order in the concept lattice. An improvement of the approach consists in automatic query refinement thanks to domain ontologies. Two forms of refinement are possible by generalisation and by specialisation.,"(176, 9)","This research paper proposes a conceptual framework based on lattice theory to facilitate the querying of a biological data repository (BioRegistry). The use of a lattice structure with ontologies allows for the representation of multiple perspectives on a particular concept, enabling efficient navigation and exploration of the underlying data sources. The proposed framework incorporates formal rules for concept classification and mapping, ensuring consistency and correctness when inferring relationships across different domains. 

The BioRegistry platform is envisioned as a centralized repository of biological data sources, facilitating data integration and interoperability within the research community. However, due to the heterogeneity and complexity of these data sources, querying the BioRegistry often requires significant domain knowledge and expertise. The conceptual framework proposed in this paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly interface that allows researchers and clinicians to explore and extract relevant information from multiple domains using a common set of ontologies.

The lattice-based framework presented in this paper is unique in its ability to represent different levels of granularity and abstraction simultaneously, enabling the discovery of hidden relationships and patterns within the data. The lattice structure also facilitates the creation of hierarchies and relationships between concepts, which can be utilized for data integration and knowledge discovery. 

The ontology-based approach presented in this paper offers a powerful means to express complex relationships in an intuitive and explicit manner. The use of formal rules ensures consistency in the representation of concepts and enables the automatic inference of relationships between them, reducing the burden on the end-user. The proposed framework has been implemented and tested on a large-scale dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in facilitating complex queries across multiple domains.

Overall, the conceptual framework proposed in this paper provides a novel way to represent, explore, and integrate biological data sources.

A so-called smart material is a material that is the seat of one or more
","A so-called smart material is a material that is the seat of one or more multiphysical coupling. One of the key points in the development of the constitutive laws of these materials, either at the local or at the global scale, is to formulate a free energy density (or enthalpy) from vectors, tensors, at a given order and for a class of given symmetry, depending on the symmetry classes of the crystal constituting the material or the symmetry of the representative volume element. This article takes as a support of study the stress and magnetization couple ($\sigma$, m) involved in the phenomena of magnetoelastic coupling in a cubic symmetry medium. Several studies indeed show a non-monotonic sensitivity of the magnetic susceptibility and magnetostriction of certain soft magnetic materials under stress. Modeling such a phenomenon requires the introduction of a second order stress term in the Gibbs free energy density. A polynomial formulation in the two variables stress and magnetization is preferred over a tensorial formulation. For a given material symmetry class, this allows to express more easily the free energy density at any bi-degree in $\sigma$ and m (i.e. at any constitutive tensors order for the so-called tensorial formulation). A rigorous and systematic method is essential to obtain the high-degree magneto-mechanical coupling terms and to build a free energy density function at any order which is invariant by the action of the cubic (octahedral) group. For that aim, theoretical and computer tools in Invariant Theory, that allow for the mathematical description of cubic nonlinear magneto-elasticity, are introduced. Minimal integrity bases of the invariant algebra for the pair (m, $\sigma$), under the proper (orientation-preserving) and the full cubic groups, are then proposed. The minimal integrity basis for the proper cubic group is constituted of 60 invariants, while the minimal integrity basis for the full cubic group (the one of interest for magneto-elasticity) is made up of 30 invariants. These invariants are formulated in a (coordinate free) intrinsic manner, using a generalized cross product to write some of them. The counting of independent invariants of a given multi-degree in (m, $\sigma$) is performed. It is shown accordingly that it is possible to list without error all the material parameters useful for the description of the coupled magnetoelastic behavior from the integrity basis. The technique is applied to derive general expressions $\Psi$ $\star$ ($\sigma$, m) of the free energy density at the magnetic domains scale exhibiting cubic symmetry. The classic results for an isotropic medium are recovered.","(482, 17)","The study of magnetostriction in materials has been the focus of numerous theoretical and experimental investigations due to its potential applications in sensors, actuators, transducers and other devices. The nonlinearity observed in magnetostriction behavior in some materials has motivated researchers to investigate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon and to explore ways to enhance its performance.

In this work, we investigate cubic nonlinear magnetostriction in materials. To accomplish this, we develop an integrity-based approach that takes into account the role of lattice symmetry, magnetic anisotropy, and electronic band structure on cubic magnetostriction in materials. Our approach is based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which incorporates both the magnetization dynamics and the lattice deformation dynamics, providing a unified framework for understanding the magnetostrictive behavior of materials. By coupling the LLG equation with the elasticity equation, we are able to study the magnetostriction of materials under different magnetic fields, crystal symmetries, and temperature conditions.

We apply our integrity-based approach to several materials including Fe, Co, and Ni, and show that our results are in good agreement with experimental observations. We also investigate the effect of defects, such as impurities and dislocations, on the magnetostriction behavior of materials. Our simulations reveal that the presence of defects can significantly affect the magnetostriction, leading to a reduction in saturation magnetostriction and a shift in the magnetic field dependence of the magnetostriction.

Our results provide insights into the mechanisms governing cubic nonlinear magnetostriction in materials, and demonstrate the importance of considering the integrity of crystals, as well as magnetic and electronic properties, when designing materials with enhanced magnetostriction. These findings could impact the development of magnetostrictive devices for various technological applications including magnetic sensors, actuators, and transducers. Further investigations should focus on understanding the effects of strain, temperature, and other external factors on magnetostriction in materials, which could lead to the development of even more advanced materials for applications in the future.","(356, 12)","A so-called smart material is a material that is the seat of one or more
properties that can be controlled by an external stimulus such as temperature,
magnetic field, electric field, light, etc. In particular, magnetic shape
memory alloys (MSMAs) are a class of smart materials that exhibit a large
magneto-mechanical response when subjected to an external magnetic field. The
mechanical response of MSMAs is due to the coupling between the magnetic and
structural degrees of freedom, which is known as the magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy (MAE). The MAE depends on the orientation of the magnetic
moments with respect to the crystallographic axes of the material, and it is
responsible for the magnetic anisotropy of the material. The MAE can be
expressed as a function of the magnetic moments and the crystallographic
axes, and it can be calculated using first-principles methods such as density
functional theory (DFT). However, the calculation of the MAE using DFT is
computationally expensive, and it requires a large amount of computational
resources. In this work, we propose a new method for calculating the MAE of
MSMAs using machine learning (ML) techniques. Our method is based on the
assumption that the MAE can be approximated by a low-dimensional manifold in
the space of magnetic moments and crystallographic axes. We use ML techniques
such as principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machines (SVMs)
to learn the structure of this manifold, and to predict the MAE of new
materials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by calculating the
MAE of several MSMAs, and comparing the results with those obtained using
DFT. Our results show that our method is able to reproduce the MAE of MSMAs
with high accuracy, and it is much faster than DFT. Our method can be used to
design new MSMAs with desired properties, and it can also be used to
understand the relationship between the magnetic and structural degrees of
freedom in MSMAs.","(359, 12)",,

Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a ubiquitous problem in computational biology. Although it is NP-hard
","Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a ubiquitous problem in computational biology. Although it is NP-hard to find an optimal solution for an arbitrary number of sequences, due to the importance of this problem researchers are trying to push the limits of exact algorithms further. Since MSA can be cast as a classical path finding problem, it is attracting a growing number of AI researchers interested in heuristic search algorithms as a challenge with actual practical relevance. In this paper, we first review two previous, complementary lines of research. Based on Hirschbergs algorithm, Dynamic Programming needs O(kN^(k-1)) space to store both the search frontier and the nodes needed to reconstruct the solution path, for k sequences of length N.

Best first search, on the other hand, has the advantage of bounding the search space that has to be explored using a heuristic. However, it is necessary to maintain all explored nodes up to the final solution in order to prevent the search from re-expanding them at higher cost. Earlier approaches to reduce the Closed list are either incompatible with pruning methods for the Open list, or must retain at least the boundary of the Closed list. In this article, we present an algorithm that attempts at combining the respective advantages; like A* it uses a heuristic for pruning the search space, but reduces both the maximum Open and Closed size to O(kN^(k-1)), as in Dynamic Programming. The underlying idea is to conduct a series of searches with successively increasing upper bounds, but using the DP ordering as the key for the Open priority queue.

With a suitable choice of thresholds, in practice, a running time below four times that of A* can be expected. In our experiments we show that our algorithm outperforms one of the currently most successful algorithms for optimal multiple sequence alignments, Partial Expansion A*, both in time and memory.

Moreover, we apply a refined heuristic based on optimal alignments not only of pairs of sequences, but of larger subsets. This idea is not new; however, to make it practically relevant we show that it is equally important to bound the heuristic computation appropriately, or the overhead can obliterate any possible gain. Furthermore, we discuss a number of improvements in time and space efficiency with regard to practical implementations. Our algorithm, used in conjunction with higher-dimensional heuristics, is able to calculate for the first time the optimal alignment for almost all of the problems in Reference 1 of the benchmark database BAliBASE.","(473, 15)","Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an important task in molecular biology that involves aligning three or more biological sequences. Accurate MSA aids in understanding evolutionary relationships among organisms, predicting protein structure and function, and identifying conserved regions for designing new drugs. However, finding an optimal MSA is a computationally expensive problem. In this paper, we propose an improved search algorithm for optimal multiple-sequence alignment that outperforms the existing state-of-the-art search algorithms in terms of both time and accuracy.

The proposed algorithm builds upon the progressive alignment methods that first construct an initial guide tree using pairwise alignments and then iteratively align sequences according to the guide tree. The main idea of our algorithm is to refine the guide tree by iteratively swapping subtrees and re-aligning sequences according to the updated guide tree. We refer to our algorithm as Tree-swapping Progressive Alignment (TPA). 

In our experiments, we tested TPA on a diverse set of MSA benchmarks and compared it with other state-of-the-art search algorithms. The results showed that TPA consistently outperformed other algorithms in terms of both objective function values and running time. Specifically, TPA achieved a better trade-off between accuracy and time than the widely used SATé algorithm. TPA also outperformed the recent COFFEE algorithm in terms of running time, while achieving similar accuracy.

Our algorithm has two key advantages. First, it produces high-quality MSA solutions with significantly improved running time over the existing methods. Second, TPA is straightforward to implement and can be easily integrated into existing MSA software pipelines. Our algorithm significantly advances the state-of-the-art in MSA search algorithms and has the potential to impact a wide range of applications in molecular biology and bioinformatics.

In conclusion, this paper proposes TPA, a novel search algorithm for optimal multiple-sequence alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that TPA has superior performance in both objective function values and running time compared to the existing state-of-the-art search algorithms. We believe that our algorithm can have a significant impact on many molecular biology and bioinformatics applications which depend on accurate and efficient multiple sequence alignment.","(373, 18)",,,,
