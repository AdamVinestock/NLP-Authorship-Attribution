This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes ","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes equations. The thesis is divided in four independent chapters.The first chapter involves a rigorous discussion about the energy's dissipation law, proposed by theory of the turbulence K41, in the deterministic setting of the homogeneous and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with a stationary external force (the force only depends of the spatial variable) and on the whole space R3. The energy's dissipation law, also called the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, characterizes the energy's dissipation rate (in the form of heat) of a turbulent fluid and this law was developed by A.N.

Kolmogorov in 1941. However, its deduction (which uses mainly tools of statistics) is not fully understood until our days and then an active research area consists in studying this law in the rigorous framework of the Navier-Stokes equations which describe in a mathematical way the fluids motion and in particular the movement of turbulent fluids. In this setting, the purpose of this chapter is to highlight the fact that if we consider the Navier-Stokes equations on R3 then certain physical quantities, necessary for the study of the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, have no a rigorous definition and then to give a sense to these quantities we suggest to consider the Navier-Stokes equations with an additional damping term. In the framework of these damped equations, we obtain some estimates for the energy's dissipation rate according to the Kolmogorov's dissipation law.In the second chapter we are interested in study the stationary solutions of the damped Navier- Stokes introduced in the previous chapter. These stationary solutions are a particular type of solutions which do not depend of the temporal variable and their study is motivated by the fact that we always consider the Navier-Stokes equations with a stationary external force. In this chapter we study two properties of the stationary solutions : the first property concerns the stability of these solutions where we prove that if we have a control on the external force then all non stationary solution (with depends of both spatial and temporal variables) converges toward a stationary solution. The second property concerns the decay in spatial variable of the stationary solutions. These properties of stationary solutions are a consequence of the damping term introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations.In the third chapter we still study the stationary solutions of Navier-Stokes equations but now we consider the classical equations (without any additional damping term). The purpose of this chapter is to study an other problem related to the deterministic description of the turbulence : the frequency decay of the stationary solutions. Indeed, according to the K41 theory, if the fluid is in a laminar setting then the stationary solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations must exhibit a exponential frequency decay which starts at lows frequencies. But, if the fluid is in a turbulent setting then this exponential frequency decay must be observed only at highs frequencies. In this chapter, using some Fourier analysis tools, we give a precise description of this exponential frequency decay in the laminar and in the turbulent setting.In the fourth and last chapter we return to the stationary solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations and we study the uniqueness of these solutions in the particular case without any external force. Following some ideas of G. Seregin, we study the uniqueness of these solutions first in the framework of Lebesgue spaces of and then in the a general framework of Morrey spaces.","(624, 16)","The Navier-Stokes equations provide a fundamental framework for understanding the behavior of fluids in a wide range of applications. One phenomenon that is crucial to explaining such behavior is the turbulence that fluids exhibit. Turbulence is a complex, dynamic process that has resisted detailed analytical investigation due to its highly nonlinear nature. Instead, researchers often rely on numerical simulations, which in turn demand accurate and efficient models for describing turbulence. 

This paper presents a thorough overview of deterministic descriptions of turbulence within the realm of Navier-Stokes equations. By focusing on the use of deterministic models, we aim to better understand the nature of turbulence, how it arises, and how it can be controlled or harnessed for practical purposes. The need for such models is pressing, as they can be used to improve the design of fluid-based technologies, such as naval vessels, aircraft, and wind turbines, among others.

The main body of the paper is divided into several sections that cover different aspects of deterministic descriptions of turbulence. The first section introduces the Navier-Stokes equations and provides a brief overview of their solution. The second section then delves into deterministic models of turbulence, starting with a basic introduction to the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence and moving on to more advanced models. In particular, we investigate models based on the concepts of eddies and energy cascades, as well as models that use multiscale approaches to capture the range of phenomena that turbulence can exhibit.

In the third section of the paper, we turn our attention to numerical simulations of turbulence. We describe the use of high-performance computing and sophisticated algorithms to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, while titrating the advantages and limitations of various numerical methods. We then proceed to describe how deterministic descriptions of turbulence can be integrated into numerical simulations for optimal performance and predictive capabilities. 

The final section of the paper discusses some of the key challenges facing the field in the coming years. These include the need for more efficient and accurate models, the development of novel simulation techniques, and the integration of experimental data to improve model prediction. We conclude by highlighting some of the potential applications of deterministic models of turbulence to industrial processes, environmental studies, and even astrophysics.

Overall, this paper presents an in-depth review of deterministic descriptions of turbulence in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the nature of turbulence and the tools necessary to control it. It is our hope that this work will help to shape future research in this important and challenging area of physics.","(489, 20)","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes  equations. The Navier-Stokes  equations are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe the motion of fluid substances. These equations have been widely used to model various types of fluid flows, including turbulent flows. Turbulence is a complex phenomenon characterized by chaotic and irregular motion of fluid particles. Despite its importance in many engineering and scientific applications, turbulence remains one of the most challenging problems in fluid dynamics.

The main objective of this research is to develop a deterministic framework for describing turbulence in theNavier-Stokes equations. To achieve this goal, we employ a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Specifically, we use the direct numerical simulation (DNS) technique to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in a three-dimensional periodic box. The DNS method involves discretizing the spatial and temporal derivatives in the governing equations and solving the resulting system of ordinary differential equations using a time-stepping algorithm. We use a high-order finite difference scheme to discretize the spatial derivatives and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to advance the solution in time.

Our DNS simulations are performed on a series of grids with increasing resolution, ranging from 128^3 to 1024^3 grid points. This allows us to study the effects of grid resolution on the accuracy and reliability of our results. We also investigate the impact of different boundary conditions on the development of turbulence. Specifically, we consider both periodic and no-slip boundary conditions at the walls of the computational domain.

One of the key findings of this research is the existence of a universal scaling law for the energy spectrum of turbulent flows. Our DNS simulations reveal that the energy spectrum follows a power-law behavior, with an exponent that depends on the Reynolds number of the flow. This result is consistent with previous experimental and numerical studies, which have shown that the energy spectrum of turbulence exhibits a power-law behavior over a wide range of scales. However, our study provides new insights into the dependence of the exponent on the Reynolds number, which has important implications for the modeling of turbulent flows.

Another significant finding of this work is the identification of a new mechanism for the generation of small-scale turbulence. Our DNS simulations show that the small-scale turbulence is generated through the interaction between large-scale eddies and the mean flow. This mechanism is distinct from the classical picture of turbulence generation, which involves the breakdown of large-scale structures into smaller scales through a process known as vortex stretching. Our results suggest that the new mechanism plays a crucial role in the development of small-scale turbulence, particularly at high Reynolds numbers.

Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is ","Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of multivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular, the diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite naturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum Parsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the analyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve the major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their discretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an unsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction How do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform themselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to present-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout the Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between these, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract some digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is classification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From images obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his observations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter (the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four categories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the famous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these classes, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been refined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global classification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by Hubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used to represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the Hubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can be understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations found between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one must admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble classification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the most obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate, qualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to characterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant multivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since the year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble classification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble classification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet emerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate analyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling the observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar clusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant objects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our present day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.

Astrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in astrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum Parsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new exploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \& Fraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a larger number of objects must now be analysed. In this paper, I","(680, 35)","Clustering is a widely used technique in astrophysics to study celestial objects and their properties. However, traditional clustering approaches often fall short in properly accounting for the complex evolutionary relationships between objects, especially those involving large-scale astrophysical phenomena. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the use of phylogenetic tools in clustering analyses in order to better understand the underlying evolutionary processes governing celestial objects in astrophysical systems.

We begin by introducing the fundamentals of phylogenetics and how it can be applied to astrophysics. We describe the concept of a ""phylogenetic tree"" which captures the hypothesized evolutionary relationships between celestial objects based on their observable traits and characteristics. By constructing these phylogenetic trees, we can gain insights into the evolutionary processes that govern these objects and how they may have evolved over time.

We then discuss how these phylogenetic tools can be incorporated into clustering analyses. We introduce a novel method for constructing phylogenetic distance matrices, which can be used as input into traditional clustering algorithms. By utilizing these distance matrices, we can cluster celestial objects based not only on their observable traits, but also on their evolutionary relationships, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical systems.

We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study of a large-scale simulation of galaxy formation and evolution. We show that the use of phylogenetic-based clustering leads to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history of galaxies within the simulation. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be used to identify ""outlier"" objects that may have unique evolutionary histories or properties.

Finally, we discuss the potential applications of phylogenetic-based clustering in future astrophysical research. We highlight the usefulness of this approach in studying diverse astrophysical systems, including stars, planets, and even entire galaxies. We also propose potential extensions to our method, such as incorporating additional sources of data or refining the phylogenetic analyses themselves.

In conclusion, this paper showcases the power of using phylogenetic tools in clustering analyses within astrophysics. By accounting for the complex evolutionary relationships between celestial objects, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical systems and their properties. We hope that this paper serves as a starting point for future research into the application of phylogenetics within astrophysics and beyond.","(417, 18)","Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology.

To address this question, we employed a combination of phylogenetic and machine learning techniques to analyze a large dataset of astrophysical observations.

We also explored the use of other phylogenetic methods, such as Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Maximum Likelihood (ML), to compare their performance with NJ.

Our dataset consisted of over 10,000 astrophysical objects, including stars, galaxies, and other celestial entities.

We used these attributes to construct a feature matrix, which was then fed into the phylogenetic algorithms.

The results of our analysis revealed several interesting patterns and relationships in the data.

Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the ","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the value of the statistic statistically significant or nonsignificant on the bases of a P value derived from a null-hypothesis test.

Taking into account that studies are manly conducted in sample, the use of null hypothesis testing only allows estimating the true values (population) of the statistics used. However, evidence has grown in many areas of knowledge that this approach often leads to confusion and misinterpretation. To overcome this limitation they have recently emerged recommendations to support the statistical analysis with approaches that make use of more intuitive interpretations and more practical, especially based on the magnitudes (certainty / uncertainty) of the true values found. With the intent to provide alternative solutions to methodological designs recurrently used in research in sports sciences, this paper will seek to i) briefly spell out some of the weaknesses associated with the null hypothesis tests based in the P value; ii) reflect on the implications of the use of practical/clinical significance as opposed to statistical significance; iii) submit proposals for use the inferences based on the magnitude, particularly in the visualization and interpretation of results; iv) present and discuss the limitations of magnitude-based inference. Thus, this update article discourages, in a sustained-based, the use of significance tests based only on the concept of null hypothesis. Alternatively, it is proposed to use methods of inference based on magnitudes as they allow interpretations of the practical/clinical effects results obtained.","(274, 7)","The use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has been widely criticized in the field of sports science, leading to the call for alternative statistical methods that can offer better insight into the magnitude of effects. Inferential statistics based on magnitude-based inferences (MBI) have emerged as a promising alternative to NHST for investigating sports-related research questions.

MBI offers the possibility of quantifying the magnitude of differences between groups or treatments, rather than simply testing for statistically significant differences. This approach provides researchers with a more meaningful interpretation of their results and can ultimately lead to more informed conclusions that are relevant to practitioners and athletes alike.

The need to move away from NHST is not only due to its limitations in providing meaningful results, but also because of its reliance on arbitrary thresholds (e.g., a p-value of 0.05) that do not necessarily reflect the strength and importance of the observed effects. In contrast, MBI uses a statistical approach that is based on the estimation of effect sizes and their confidence intervals, enabling a more nuanced interpretation of the findings. 

Moreover, MBI can also mitigate problems associated with small sample sizes, which are common in sports science research. By focusing on effect size rather than the p-value, MBI can provide more stable and reliable estimates of the true population effect, even when working with small sample sizes.

MBI also offers advantages over other approaches, such as Bayesian statistics, in terms of its simplicity, ease of interpretation, and its potential to improve scientific communication. By adopting MBI, researchers and practitioners in sports science can overcome some of the limitations of NHST and obtain more meaningful and informative results.

In conclusion, the use of MBI in the investigation of sports-related research questions is becoming increasingly popular. MBI offers a more meaningful and informative approach to statistical inference, which can ultimately lead to more informed conclusions and practical implications for athletes and practitioners. The scientific community should continue to embrace and explore the potential of MBI as a valuable alternative to NHST in sports science research.","(378, 13)","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between two magnitudes. However, these inferences rely heavily on the null hypothesis testing (NHT) framework, which has been widely criticized for its limitations and misinterpretations. This paper aims to investigate the necessity of breaking away from the NHT framework and the reliance on p-values in the context of magnitude-based inference (MBI) in Sports Sciences.

A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to examine the current state of MBI in Sports Sciences, focusing on the use of NHT and p-values. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts in the field to gather their perspectives on the limitations of NHT and the potential benefits of adopting MBI.

The results of the systematic review revealed that the majority of studies in Sports Sciences continue to rely on NHT, despite the well-documented limitations of this approach. The interviews with experts highlighted the need for a shift towards MBI, which provides a more nuanced and informative approach to inference. The findings suggest that MBI offers several advantages over NHT, including the ability to provide more precise estimates of effect sizes and the capacity to account for uncertainty in a more comprehensive manner.

The implications of this study are significant, as they highlight the need for a paradigm shift in the way researchers in Sports Sciences approach inference. By adopting MBI, researchers can gain a more accurate understanding of the effects of interventions and make more informed decisions about future research directions. Furthermore, the adoption of MBI has the potential to improve the transparency and reproducibility of research in Sports Sciences, ultimately contributing to the advancement of the field. Overall, this study provides a critical examination of the current state of inference in Sports Sciences and highlights the need for a more robust and informative approach to research in this field. The findings of this study have important implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in Sports Sciences, and contribute to the ongoing debate about the role of statistics in scientific inquiry. By challenging the dominant NHT framework and promoting the use of MBI, this study aims to contribute to a more nuanced and informed understanding of the complex relationships between variables in Sports Sciences. Ultimately, this study seeks to promote a more evidence-based approach to decision-making in Sports Sciences, one that is grounded in a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and processes that shape human performance.

The null hypothesis states that there is no relationship between two variables (e.g. ""There is no difference in the performance of athletes who use doping and athletes who do not use doping""). The null hypothesis can be rejected if the p-value is less than 0.05 (i.e. there is less than a 5% chance that the null hypothesis is true).

###","(276, 14)","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between two magnitudes. However, these inferences rely heavily on the null hypothesis testing (NHT) framework, which has been widely criticized for its limitations and misinterpretations. This paper aims to investigate the necessity of breaking away from the NHT framework and the reliance on p-values in the context of magnitude-based inference (MBI) in Sports Sciences.

A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to examine the current state of MBI in Sports Sciences, focusing on the use of NHT and p-values. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts in the field to gather their perspectives on the limitations of NHT and the potential benefits of adopting MBI.

The results of the systematic review revealed that the majority of studies in Sports Sciences continue to rely on NHT, despite the well-documented limitations of this approach. The interviews with experts highlighted the need for a shift towards MBI, which provides a more nuanced and informative approach to inference. The findings suggest that MBI offers several advantages over NHT, including the ability to provide more precise estimates of effect sizes and the capacity to account for uncertainty in a more comprehensive manner.

The implications of this study are significant, as they highlight the need for a paradigm shift in the way researchers in Sports Sciences approach inference. By adopting MBI, researchers can gain a more accurate understanding of the effects of interventions and make more informed decisions about future research directions. Furthermore, the adoption of MBI has the potential to improve the transparency and reproducibility of research in Sports Sciences, ultimately contributing to the advancement of the field. Overall, this study provides a critical examination of the current state of inference in Sports Sciences and highlights the need for a more robust and informative approach to research in this field. The findings of this study have important implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in Sports Sciences, and contribute to the ongoing debate about the role of statistics in scientific inquiry. By challenging the dominant NHT framework and promoting the use of MBI, this study aims to contribute to a more nuanced and informed understanding of the complex relationships between variables in Sports Sciences. Ultimately, this study seeks to promote a more evidence-based approach to decision-making in Sports Sciences, one that is grounded in a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and processes that shape human performance. By doing so, this study contributes to the advancement of knowledge in Sports Sciences and has the potential to inform policy and practice","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the ""null hypothesis"" (H0). The null hypothesis states that there is no relationship between two variables (e.g. ""There is no difference in the performance of athletes who use doping and athletes who do not use doping""). The null hypothesis can be rejected if the p-value is less than 0.05 (i.e. there is less than a 5% chance that the null hypothesis is true).

Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set ","Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. A $k$-dimensional box is a Cartesian product of closed intervals $[a_1,b_1]\times [a_2,b_2]\times...\times [a_k,b_k]$. The {\it boxicity} of $G$, $\boxi(G)$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ can be represented as the intersection graph of $k$-dimensional boxes, i.e. each vertex is mapped to a $k$-dimensional box and two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and only if their corresponding boxes intersect. Let $\poset=(S,P)$ be a poset where $S$ is the ground set and $P$ is a reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive binary relation on $S$. The dimension of $\poset$, $\dim(\poset)$ is the minimum integer $t$ such that $P$ can be expressed as the intersection of $t$ total orders. Let $G_\poset$ be the \emph{underlying comparability graph} of $\poset$, i.e. $S$ is the vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are comparable in $\poset$. It is a well-known fact that posets with the same underlying comparability graph have the same dimension. The first result of this paper links the dimension of a poset to the boxicity of its underlying comparability graph. In particular, we show that for any poset $\poset$, $\boxi(G_\poset)/(\chi(G_\poset)-1) \le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$, where $\chi(G_\poset)$ is the chromatic number of $G_\poset$ and $\chi(G_\poset)\ne1$. It immediately follows that if $\poset$ is a height-2 poset, then $\boxi(G_\poset)\le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ since the underlying comparability graph of a height-2 poset is a bipartite graph. The second result of the paper relates the boxicity of a graph $G$ with a natural partial order associated with the \emph{extended double cover} of $G$, denoted as $G_c$: Note that $G_c$ is a bipartite graph with partite sets $A$ and $B$ which are copies of $V(G)$ such that corresponding to every $u\in V(G)$, there are two vertices $u_A\in A$ and $u_B\in B$ and $\{u_A,v_B\}$ is an edge in $G_c$ if and only if either $u=v$ or $u$ is adjacent to $v$ in $G$. Let $\poset_c$ be the natural height-2 poset associated with $G_c$ by making $A$ the set of minimal elements and $B$ the set of maximal elements. We show that $\frac{\boxi(G)}{2} \le \dim(\poset_c) \le 2\boxi(G)+4$. These results have some immediate and significant consequences. The upper bound $\dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ allows us to derive hitherto unknown upper bounds for poset dimension such as $\dim(\poset)\le 2\tw(G_\poset)+4$, since boxicity of any graph is known to be at most its $\tw+2$. In the other direction, using the already known bounds for partial order dimension we get the following: (1) The boxicity of any graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ is $O(\Delta\log^2\Delta)$ which is an improvement over the best known upper bound of $\Delta^2+2$. (2) There exist graphs with boxicity $\Omega(\Delta\log\Delta)$. This disproves a conjecture that the boxicity of a graph is $O(\Delta)$. (3) There exists no polynomial-time algorithm to approximate the boxicity of a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with a factor of $O(n^{0.5-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$, unless $NP=ZPP$.","(798, 21)","Boxicity and Poset Dimension are two closely related concepts in combinatorial optimization that have recently received extensive attention. Boxicity refers to the smallest integer k such that a graph can be represented as the intersection graph of k-dimensional axis-aligned boxes. Poset Dimension, on the other hand, measures the smallest number of linear extensions required to represent a partially ordered set (poset). While seemingly distinct, recent research has shown that these two concepts are closely related, and understanding one can give insight into the other.

The study of these two concepts has important practical applications in fields such as scheduling, logistics, and VLSI layout design. For example, in scheduling applications, boxicity can be used to construct scheduling models based on resource constraints where the resources have different capacities. These models are used in a variety of industries, such as manufacturing and transportation, to optimize the use of resources and increase efficiency.

In the past few decades, much research has been devoted to the algorithmic aspects of Boxicity and Poset Dimension. Algorithms have been developed to compute the boxicity and the poset dimension of a given graph, which have found applications in data analysis and optimization. Additionally, several linear time algorithms have been developed to compute the poset dimension of certain classes of posets such as grid posets.

Despite these algorithmic advances, there are still many open problems related to Boxicity and Poset Dimension. One such problem is determining the relationship between these two concepts for specific classes of graphs. Another open problem is determining the computational complexity of the poset dimension problem for certain classes of posets.

In recent years, researchers have also explored the relationship between Boxicity and Poset Dimension and other graph parameters, such as tree-width, clique number, and chromatic number. Several results have been obtained showing connections between these parameters, which can be useful when analyzing large datasets.

Overall, the study of Boxicity and Poset Dimension has applications in a wide range of fields and has stimulated much research in combinatorial optimization. Although many problems related to these concepts remain open, recent advances have shed light on their connections to other graph parameters, and further research in this area has the potential to unlock new insights and improve the efficiency of data analysis at large.","(418, 17)","Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set  $E(G)$. The boxicity of $G$, denoted by $b(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ can be represented as the intersection graph of $k$ axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the space. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the boxicity of a graph and its poset dimension.

A poset (partially ordered set) is a pair $(P, \leq)$, where $P$ is a set and $\leq$ is a binary relation on $P$ that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. The dimension of a poset is the minimum number of linear extensions of the poset such that every element of the poset is greater than or equal to every other element in at least one of the linear extensions. Given a graph $G$, we can associate a poset $P(G)$ with $G$ as follows: the elements of $P(G)$ are the vertices of $G$, and for any two vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$, we say that $u \leq v$ in $P(G)$ if and only if there is a path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$.

In this paper, we show that for any graph $G$, $b(G) \leq \dim(P(G))$, where $\dim(P(G))$ denotes the dimension of the poset associated with $G$. This result provides a new upper bound on the boxicity of graphs in terms of their poset dimension. We also show that there exists a graph $G$ such that $b(G) > \dim(P(G))/2$, which implies that the upper bound given by our result is tight up to a constant factor.

Our proof of the upper bound involves constructing a box representation of $G$ from a linear extension of $P(G)$. Specifically, given a linear extension $L$ of $P(G),$ we define a box representation $\mathcal{B}_L$ of $G$ by associating with each vertex $v \in V(G)$ a box $B_v = [a_v, b_v] \times [c_v, d_v] \times \cdots \times [e_v, f_v]$ such that $a_v < b_v < c_v < d_v < \cdots < e_v < f_v$","(524, 11)","Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$.

This second part of a 2 volume-expertise is mainly based on the results of the ","This second part of a 2 volume-expertise is mainly based on the results of the inventory described in the first part. It is also based on a ""worrying"" statement in the terms of reference of this expert report 1, which states that ""Asia enjoys a favourable technological context [in terms of equipment according to UN statistics]. Nevertheless, digital technology is still hardly present in the practices of the member institutions of the Agency and the francophone university community; So distance education is not well developed: there are currently no French-language distance training courses offered by an establishment in Asia; The region has only 14 enrolled in ODL over the period 2010 - 2014; Only three institutions have responded to the AUF's ""Mooc"" calls for projects over the last two years, etc."". The terms of reference also indicate a state of deficiency ""in the Francophone digital campuses whose officials explain that the computer equipment are less and less used for individual practices"". The proliferation of mobile digital technologies that would normally constitute an important asset for the development of teaching practices and innovative research around the Francophone digital campuses has not lived up to expectations. The paper refers to another no less important detail that would explain the paradox between the proliferation of technological tools and the reduction in usage when it indicates that, in parallel, and contrary to the francophone campuses, In English a positive dynamics of integration of T ICE and distance"". The document provides concrete examples, such as the ASEAN Cyber University (ACU) program run by South Korea and its e-learning centers in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar, The Vietnamese language and the fablab set up in the region since 2014 without the Francophonie being involved. A first hypothesis emerges from this premonitory observation that it is not technology that justifies the gradual demobilization (or even demotivation) of local actors to establish forms of Francophone partnerships for training and research. Nor is it a question of political will to improve technological infrastructure in digital training and research.

Almost all the interviews carried out within the framework of this mission demonstrated the convergence of views and ambitious attitudes expressed by three categories of actors encountered:- political actors met in the ministries of education of the three countries who are aware of the importance of digital education and the added value generated by technologies for education. Each of the three countries has a regulatory framework and national technological innovation projects for education and digital education;- public and private academic institutions which, through their rectors, presidents and technical and pedagogical leaders, demonstrate their profound convictions for digital education (for reasons of quality, competitiveness and economic interest).

However, given the rather centralized governance model at state level, the majority of academic institutions in the three countries are often awaiting the promulgation of legal texts (decrees, charters, conventions, directives , Etc.) that enable them to act and adopt innovative solutions in teaching and research;- Teacher-researchers relatively little consulted in this expertise, but sufficiently engaged as actors on the ground to be able to predict their points of view with regard to the use of digital in their pedagogical and research activities. Teachers and researchers with relatively modest incomes would inevitably have a decisive role in any academic reform on the digital level if concrete mobilizing arguments could compensate for their shortfalls by joining digital training or development projects or programs.","(631, 14)","This research paper explores the potential of distance learning and digital tools for higher education and research in the Asia-Pacific region, specifically focusing on Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The second part of this paper presents a set of recommendations and a roadmap for implementing these technologies in these countries.

The first recommendation is to invest in infrastructure that supports digital learning. This includes building robust networks, providing access to digital devices, and training teachers and students on how to use these tools effectively. Governments and universities must collaborate to make these resources widely available.

The second recommendation is to create and curate high-quality digital content. Textbooks, lectures, and other learning materials should be developed or adapted for digital formats, and made available online for free or at a low cost. Collaboration between institutions can help pool resources and reduce duplication of effort.

The third recommendation is to develop interactive and collaborative learning tools. These tools can help students engage with course materials and with each other, even when they are studying remotely. This can include videoconferencing software, social media platforms, and online discussion forums.

The fourth recommendation is to ensure that the development of digital learning tools is based on research and best practices. This includes evaluating the effectiveness of different tools and approaches, and using this information to improve their design and implementation. Research should also be conducted on the impact of digital learning on student outcomes.

The final recommendation is to foster a culture of innovation and collaboration. This includes creating spaces for experimentation and learning, and providing opportunities for educators and researchers to share their experiences and insights. Governments and universities must work together to support this culture.

To achieve these recommendations, a roadmap is proposed that outlines the necessary steps and timelines. This includes identifying key stakeholders and partners, setting up pilot projects, and scaling up successful initiatives. The roadmap also highlights potential challenges and risks that must be addressed, such as the need for adequate funding and the risk of unequal access to digital resources.

Overall, this paper argues that distance learning and digital tools have the potential to transform higher education and research in the Asia-Pacific region, but that careful planning and implementation are necessary to ensure their effectiveness and accessibility. The recommendations and roadmap presented in this paper can serve as a starting point for governments, universities, and other stakeholders in the region who are interested in pursuing this path.","(450, 22)","This second part of a 2 volume-expertise is mainly based on the results of the 2019-2020 survey conducted in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.

Two 5 GHz 500 kW BeO pill-box type window prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company, in close collaboration with CEA/IRFM. Both windows have been validated at low power, showing good agreement between measured and modeling, with a return loss better than 32 dB and an insertion loss below 0.05 dB. This paper reports on the window RF design and the low power measurements. The high power tests up to 500kW have been carried out in March 2013 in collaboration with NFRI. Results of these tests are also reported. In the current ITER LHCD design, 20 MW Continuous Wave (CW) of Radio-Frequency power at 5 GHz are expected to be generated and transmitted to the plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat waveguide pressure, forty eight 5 GHz 500kW CW windows are to be assembled on the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, forty eight additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate and monitor the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line pressure. These windows are identified as being one of the main critical components for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies [1] [2] [3] or more recently [4] [5] , and clearly require an important R\&D effort. In this context and even if the LHCD system is not part of the construction baseline, the CEA/IRFM is conducting a R\&D effort in order to validate a design and the performances of these RF windows. In order to begin the assessment of this need, two 5 GHz 500 kW/5 s pill-box type windows prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company in close collaboration with the CEA/IRFM [6]. The section 2 of this paper reports the RF and mechanical design of a 5 GHz window. Some features of the mechanical design and the experimental RF measurements at low power are reported in section 3. High power results, made in collaboration with NFRI, are detailed in section 4. The development of CW windows is discussed in the conclusion. 2-RF AND MECHANICAL DESIGN The proposed 5 GHz RF window is based on a pill-box design [2] , i.e. a ceramic brazed in portion of a circular waveguide, connected on either side to a rectangular waveguide section. Typical design rules of thumb of such device are circular section diameter about the same size of the diagonal of the rectangular waveguide (cf. FIGURE 1). Without taking into account the ceramic, the circular section length is approximately half a guided wavelength of the circular TE 11 mode, in order for the device to act as a half-wave transformer.

Once optimized, taking into account the ceramic, matching is correct only for a narrow band of frequency and is very sensitive to the device dimensions and the ceramic relative permittivity. The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be extracted by an active water cooling, depends on the inside electric field topology and of ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent). Undesirable modes due to parasitic resonances can be excited in the ceramic volume, raising the electric field and","(624, 24)","The development of next-generation fusion reactors, such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), requires the use of high power sources to generate and sustain plasma. The Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system is one such high-energy source that is designed to provide steady-state current drive for fusion reactor operation. In order to achieve this, the LHCD system requires a high-power window capable of transmitting RF power to the plasma.

This paper describes the design and RF measurements of a 5 GHz 500 kW window for the ITER LHCD system. The goal of this research was to develop an optimized design for the window that would meet the stringent requirements of the LHCD system, while also providing reliable and efficient operation. The window design was based on a number of key factors, including the transmission properties of the materials, the need for high power handling capability, and the thermal management of the structure.

Simulations were used to optimize the design of the window, and several prototypes were fabricated to investigate the performance of the design under a variety of conditions. RF measurements were taken on the prototypes to determine their transmission properties and to verify that they met the requirements of the LHCD system. The results of these measurements revealed that the window design was able to meet all of the high-power requirements of the ITER LHCD system.

The research also investigated the thermal behavior of the window during operation, using simulations and experimental measurements. The results showed that the thermal management of the window was critical to its performance, as high-power RF transmission caused significant heating of the window. The simulations and experiments showed that effective cooling of the window was necessary to maintain reliable and efficient operation.

Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron ","Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron to centimeter size. Meteorites are evidence that individual grains of those sizes were collected and assembled into planetesimals in the young solar system. Aims. We assess the efficiency of dust collection of a swarm of non-drifting planetesimals {\rev with radii ranging from 1 to $10^3$\,km and beyond. Methods. We calculate the collision probability of dust drifting in the disk due to gas drag by planetesimal accounting for several regimes depending on the size of the planetesimal, dust, and orbital distance: the geometric, Safronov, settling, and three-body regimes. We also include a hydrodynamical regime to account for the fact that small grains tend to be carried by the gas flow around planetesimals. Results. We provide expressions for the collision probability of dust by planetesimals and for the filtering efficiency by a swarm of planetesimals. For standard turbulence conditions (i.e., a turbulence parameter $\alpha=10^{-2}$), filtering is found to be inefficient, meaning that when crossing a minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) belt of planetesimals extending between 0.1 AU and 35 AU most dust particles are eventually accreted by the central star rather than colliding with planetesimals. However, if the disk is weakly turbulent ($\alpha=10^{-4}$) filtering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all smaller than about 10 km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in the geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km in size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller than one tenth of the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case most collisions take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very different properties: we find that the local filtering efficiency $x_{filter,MMSN}$ scales with $r^{-7/4}$ (where $r$ is the orbital distance) in the geometric regime, but with $r^{-1/4}$ to $r^{1/4}$ in the settling regime.

This implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur close to the central star and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the other hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling regime is expected to be more gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust particles much smaller than millimeter size tend only to be captured by the smallest planetesimals because they otherwise move on gas streamlines and their collisions take place in the hydrodynamical regime. Conclusions. Our results hint at an inside-out formation of planetesimals in the infant solar system because small planetesimals in the geometrical limit can filter dust much more efficiently close to the central star. However, even a fully-formed belt of planetesimals such as the MMSN only marginally captures inward-drifting dust and this seems to imply that dust in the protosolar disk has been filtered by planetesimals even smaller than 1 km (not included in this study) or that it has been assembled into planetesimals by other mechanisms (e.g., orderly growth, capture into vortexes). Further refinement of our work concerns, among other things: a quantitative description of the transition region between the hydro and settling regimes; an assessment of the role of disk turbulence for collisions, in particular in the hydro regime; and the coupling of our model to a planetesimal formation model.","(646, 20)","This research paper explores the mechanisms of dust filtering and processing in planetesimals, specifically focusing on non-drifting planetesimals. The collision probabilities for such planetesimals were derived and analyzed to illuminate their impacts on the filtration and processing of dust. These collision probabilities were analyzed through numerical simulations, which incorporated varied parameters such as planetesimal radius and density as well as dust particle size and distribution.


The results of the analysis show that non-drifting planetesimals play a significant role in the early stages of planet formation through their ability to filter and process dust. Through collisions with dust particles, these planetesimals are able to both grow in size and remove debris from the surrounding environment. The effects of this filtering and processing are not only important for the planetesimal itself, but also relevant for later stages of planet formation when large bodies form through collisions of planetesimals.


The analytical framework and numerical simulations used in the research provide a foundation for future studies into the processes of dust filtering and processing by planetesimals. The collision probabilities derived for non-drifting planetesimals can be applied to other studies of planetesimal growth and dust filtration, improving our understanding of early stages of planetary formation.


An important implication of this research is that the mechanisms of dust filtration and processing by non-drifting planetesimals enable the successful formation of larger bodies like planets and asteroids, crucial to the evolution of our solar system and others. By examining these mechanisms, insights can be gained not only into the formation of planets, but also into the evolution of other celestial bodies throughout the universe.


In conclusion, this research paper provides a thorough analysis of the collision probabilities for non-drifting planetesimals and their impact on the processing and filtering of dust. The results show that non-drifting planetesimals play an important role in the early stages of planet formation through their ability to remove debris and grow in size. This research can improve our understanding of the formation of planets not only in our solar system, but throughout the universe as well.

Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron  to centimeter-sized particles. These particles play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Planetesimals, which are small, solid bodies in the early solar nebula, are thought to be the building blocks of planets. However, the process by which dust is filtered and processed by planetesimals is not well understood.

Research Question. The primary objective of this study is to derive a mathematical framework for calculating collision probabilities between dust particles and planetesimals. Specifically, we aim to develop a model that accounts for the non-drifting motion of planetesimals, which is essential for understanding the dynamics of dust-planetesimal interactions.

Methodology. To address this research question, we employed a combination of analytical and numerical methods. First, we developed a theoretical framework for describing the motion of dust particles in the vicinity of a planetesimal. This framework takes into account the gravitational attraction between the planetesimal and the dust particle, as well as the effects of radiation pressure and gas drag. We then used numerical simulations to validate our analytical model and to investigate the effects of various parameters on the collision probability.

Key Findings. Our results show that the collision probability between a dust particle and a non-drifting planetesimal is significantly influenced by the planetesimal's size, shape, and velocity. We found that larger planetesimals have a higher collision probability due to their stronger gravitational attraction, while smaller planetesimals are more susceptible to collisions due to their higher velocity dispersion. Additionally, we discovered that the collision probability is highly sensitive to the dust particle's size and velocity, with smaller particles being more likely to collide with the planetesimal.

Implications. The derived collision probabilities have important implications for our understanding of dust processing in circumstellar disks. Our results suggest that planetesimals play a critical role in filtering and processing dust, with larger planetesimals being more effective at removing smaller dust particles from the disk. This, in turn, affects the growth and evolution of planets, as the availability of dust particles influences the formation of planetesimals and the subsequent accretion of larger bodies. Furthermore, our findings have implications for the study of exoplanetary systems, where the presence of dust and planetesimals can impact the detectability and characterization of exoplanets.

Limitations. While our study provides a significant advancement in the field, there are several limitations that need to be addressed in future work. Firstly, our model assumes a simplified geometry for the planetesimal, which may not accurately represent the complex shapes and sizes of real planetesimals.","(478, 25)","Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron (μm) to millimeter (mm) sized particles. These dust grains are thought to be the precursors to planetesimal formation. Planetesimals are believed to be the building blocks of planets and planetary systems.
Question. What is the probability that a planetesimal will collide with another planetesimal?
Answer. The probability of a collision between planetesimal A and planetesimal B is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The probability that a collision will occur is given by:
P = (m_A * m_B) / (r_A^2 * r_B^2)

Stylolites are ubiquitous geo-patterns observed in rocks in the upper crust, from geological reservoirs in ","Stylolites are ubiquitous geo-patterns observed in rocks in the upper crust, from geological reservoirs in sedimentary rocks to deformation zones, in folds, faults, and shear zones. These rough surfaces play a major role in the dissolution of rocks around stressed contacts, the transport of dissolved material and the precipitation in surrounding pores. Consequently, they play an active role in the evolution of rock microstructures and rheological properties in the Earth's crust. They are observed individually or in networks, in proximity to fractures and joints, and in numerous geological settings. This review article deals with their geometrical and compositional characteristics and the factors leading to their genesis. The main questions this review focuses on are the following: How do they form? How can they be used to measure strain and formation stress? How do they control fluid flow in the upper crust?

Geometrically, stylolites have fractal roughness, with fractal geometrical properties exhibiting typically three scaling regimes: a self-affine scaling with Hurst exponent 1.1+/-0.1 at small scale (up to tens or hundreds of microns), another one with Hurst exponent around 0.5 to 0.6 at intermediate scale (up to millimeters or centimeters), and in the case of sedimentary stylolites, a flat scaling at large scale. More complicated anisotropic scaling (scaling laws depending of the direction of the profile considered) is found in the case of tectonic stylolites. We report models based on first principles from physical chemistry and statistical physics, including a mechanical component for the free-energy associated with stress concentrations, and a precise tracking of the influence of grain-scale heterogeneities and disorder on the resulting (micro)structures. Experimental efforts to reproduce stylolites in the laboratory are also reviewed. We show that although micrometer-size stylolite teeth are obtained in laboratory experiments, teeth deforming numerous grains have not yet been obtained experimentally, which is understandable given the very long formation time of such geometries. Finally, the applications of stylolites as strain and stress markers, to determine paleostress magnitude are reviewed. We show that the scalings in stylolite heights and the crossover scale between these scalings can be used to determine the stress magnitude (its scalar value) perpendicular to the stylolite surface during the stylolite formation, and that the stress anisotropy in the stylolite plane can be determined for the case of tectonic stylolites. We also show that the crossover between medium (millimetric) scales and large (pluricentimetric) scales, in the case of sedimentary stylolites, provides a good marker for the total amount of dissolution, which is still valid even when the largest teeth start to dissolve -- which leads to the loss of information, since the total deformation is not anymore recorded in a single marker structure. We discuss the impact of the stylolites on the evolution of the transport properties of the hosting rock, and show that they promote a permeability increase parallel to the stylolites, whereas their effect on the permeability transverse to the stylolite can be negligible, or may reduce the permeability, depending on the development of the stylolite.

Highlights: Stylolite formation depends on rock composition and structure, stress and fluids. Stylolite geometry, fractal and self-affine properties, network structure, are investigated. The experiments and physics-based numerical models for their formation are reviewed. Stylolites can be used as markers of strain, paleostress orientation and magnitude. Stylolites impact transport properties, as function of maturity and flow direction.","(627, 22)","Stylolites are a critical feature in sedimentary rocks, which have garnered significant interest over the years given their widespread occurrence and potential significance in several geological processes. In this review, we provide an extensive analysis of the literature available on stylolites, thereby enabling a better understanding of their behavior and formation mechanisms. First, we discuss the various historical perspectives on stylolites and the evolution of ideas explaining their formation. Subsequently, we delve into the current understanding of the physical and chemical processes that induce and animate stylolites. We highlight field and laboratory studies, alongside analytical techniques such as petrography, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe, and Raman spectroscopy, which have contributed significantly to the current state of knowledge on stylolites.

We further analyze the composition and mineralogy of stylolites with a discussion on their role in hydrocarbon exploration. We evaluate the interplay between mechanical and chemical compaction mechanisms in their formation and briefly examine some of the significant implications in reservoir quality assessments. We discuss how their presence can affect porosity, permeability, and ultimately oil recovery in underground reservoirs and provide a comprehensive review of the available literature on stylolites as a tool in hydrocarbon exploration. 

Furthermore, we expound on the association of stylolites with various geological phenomena, including deformation stress, fluid activity, and diagenesis. We examine the evidence of syn-sedimentary versus post-sedimentary origin of stylolites, which has significant implications for their interpretation and paleo-environmental reconstructions. The review offers insight into the potential use of stylolites in paleostress and paleohydrology analysis and their significance as proxies for burial depth. 

We conclude our review by discussing current controversies in the field of stylolites such as their mode of initiation, the extent of their influence on rock properties, and their role as deformation markers. Additionally, we highlight some of the gaps in current knowledge on stylolites and offer suggestions for future research areas. Through this comprehensive review, we hope to provide a better understanding of stylolites, the processes that produce them, and their potential applications in diverse geological fields.","(373, 14)","Stylolites are ubiquitous geo-patterns observed in rocks in the upper crust, from geological reservoirs in 1-5 km depth to surface outcrops. Despite their widespread occurrence, stylolites remain poorly understood in terms of their origin, evolution, and impact on rock properties. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge on stylolites, focusing on their definition, classification, formation mechanisms, and effects on rock mechanical and petrophysical properties.

To address the research question, we conducted a thorough literature review of existing studies on stylolites published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. Our search strategy included keywords related to stylolites, such as ""stylolite,"" ""stylolitic,"" ""rock deformation,"" ""fracture,"" and ""diagenesis."" We also consulted online databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus, to ensure a comprehensive coverage of the literature.

Our review reveals that stylolites are characterized by a unique combination of features, including (1) a planar or wavy morphology, (2) a sharp or rounded edge, (3) a smooth or rough surface, and (4) a variable orientation relative to the surrounding rock fabric. Stylolites can be classified into three main types: (1) primary stylolites, which form during the initial stages of rock deformation; (2) secondary stylolites, formed through the reactivation of pre-existing fractures; and (3) tertiary stylolites, resulting from the intersection of multiple fractures.

The formation mechanisms of stylolites are complex and multifaceted, involving a combination of tectonic forces, fluid flow, and diagenetic processes. Primary stylolites are thought to form through the dissolution of minerals along pre-existing fractures, while secondary stylolites result from the reactivation of these fractures under changing stress conditions. Tertiary stylolites, on the other hand, are believed to form through the interaction of multiple fractures, leading to the creation of complex networks of stylolitic surfaces.

Our review highlights the significant impact of stylolites on rock mechanical properties, including strength, stiffness, and permeability. Stylolitic surfaces can act as preferential pathways for fluid flow, leading to changes in rock permeability and porosity. Additionally, stylolites can influence rock strength by creating planes of weakness, which can be exploited by fractures and faults. Furthermore, stylolites have been shown to affect rock stiffness, with stylolitic surfaces exhibiting reduced stiffness compared to non-stylolitic areas.

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge on stylolites, focusing on their definition, classification, formation mechanisms, and effects on rock mechanical and petrophysical properties.

To address the research question, we conducted a thorough literature review of existing studies on stylolites published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. Our search strategy included keywords related to stylolites, such as ""stylolite,"" ""stylolitic,"" ""rock deformation,"" ""fracture,"" and ""diagenesis."" We also consulted online databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus, to ensure a comprehensive coverage of the literature.

Our review reveals that stylolites are characterized by a unique combination of features, including (1) a planar or wavy morphology, (2) a sharp or rounded edge, (3) a smooth or rough surface, and (4) a variable orientation relative to the surrounding rock fabric. Stylolites can be classified into three main types: (1) primary stylolites, which form during the initial stages of rock deformation; (2) secondary stylolites, formed through the reactivation of pre-existing fractures; and (3) tertiary stylolites, resulting from the intersection of multiple fractures.

The formation mechanisms of stylolites are complex and multifaceted, involving a combination of tectonic forces, fluid flow, and diagenetic processes. Primary stylolites are thought to form through the dissolution of minerals along pre-existing fractures, while secondary stylolites result from the reactivation of these fractures under changing stress conditions. Tertiary stylolites, on the other hand, are believed to form through the interaction of multiple fractures, leading to the creation of complex networks of stylolitic surfaces.

Our review highlights the significant impact of stylolites on rock mechanical properties, including strength, stiffness, and permeability. Stylolitic surfaces can act as preferential pathways for fluid flow, leading to changes in rock permeability and porosity. Additionally, stylolites can influence rock strength by creating planes of weakness, which can be exploited by fractures and faults. Furthermore, stylolites have been shown to affect rock stiffness, with stylolitic surfaces exhibiting reduced stiffness compared to non-stylolitic areas.

Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to give ","Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to give H(2)O(2). Recently, the mutation of the Glu47 residue into alanine (E47A) in the active site of SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii has allowed the stabilization of an iron-peroxo species when quickly reacted with H(2)O(2) [Math{\'e} et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 4966-4967]. To further investigate this non-heme peroxo-iron species, we have carried out a M{\""o}ssbauer study of the (57)Fe-enriched E47A SOR from D. baarsii reacted quickly with H(2)O(2). Considering the M{\""o}ssbauer data, we conclude, in conjunction with the other spectroscopic data available and with the results of density functional calculations on related models, that this species corresponds to a high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) complex. This is one of the first examples of such a species in a biological system for which M{\""o}ssbauer parameters are now available: delta(/Fe) = 0.54 (1) mm/s, DeltaE(Q) = -0.80 (5) mm/s, and the asymmetry parameter eta = 0.60 (5) mm/s. The M{\""o}ssbauer and spin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on peroxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center in SOR from Pyrococcus furiosus, for which structural data are available in the literature [Yeh et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2499-2508]. For comparison, similar calculations have been carried out on a model derived from 2 (model 3), where the [CH(3)-S](1)(-) group has been replaced by the neutral [NH(3)](0) group [Neese and Solomon (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12829-12848]. Both models 2 and 3 contain a formally high-spin Fe(3+) ion (i.e., with empty minority spin orbitals). We found, however, a significant fraction (approximately 0.6 for 2, approximately 0.8 for 3) of spin (equivalently charge) spread over two occupied (minority spin) orbitals. The quadrupole splitting value for 2 is found to be negative and matches quite well the experimental value. The computed quadrupole tensors are rhombic in the case of 2 and axial in the case of 3. This difference originates directly from the presence of the thiolate ligand in 2. A correlation between experimental isomer shifts for Fe(3+) mononuclear complexes with computed electron densities at the iron nucleus has been built and used to evaluate the isomer shift values for 2 and 3 (0.56 and 0.63 mm/s, respectively). A significant increase of isomer shift value is found upon going from a methylthiolate to a nitrogen ligand for the Fe(3+) ion, consistent with covalency effects due to the presence of the axial thiolate ligand. Considering that the isomer shift value for 3 is likely to be in the 0.61-0.65 mm/s range [Horner et al. (2002) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 3278-3283], the isomer shift value for a high-spin eta(2)-O(2) Fe(3+) complex with an axial thiolate group can be estimated to be in the 0.54-0.58 mm/s range. The occurrence of a side-on peroxo intermediate in SOR is discussed in relation to the recent data published for a side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) species in another biological system [Karlsson et al.

Additionally, we investigate the effect of various ligands on the stability and electronic properties of the peroxo species using DFT.

Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive ","Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive reasoning. This is so because there are general and definite rules for the change of subjective probabilities through information or experience; induction and belief change are one and same topic, after all. The most basic of these rules is simply to conditionalize with respect to the information received; and there are similar and more general rules. 1 Hence, a fundamental reason for the epistemological success of probability theory is that there at all exists a well-behaved concept of conditional probability. Still, people have, and have reasons for, various concerns over probability theory. One of these is my starting point: Intuitively, we have the notion of plain belief; we believe propositions2 to be true (or to be false or neither). Probability theory, however, offers no formal counterpart to this notion. Believing A is not the same as having probability 1 for A, because probability 1 is incorrigible3; but plain belief is clearly corrigible. And believing A is not the same as giving A a probability larger than some 1 - c, because believing A and believing B is usually taken to be equivalent to believing A & B.4 Thus, it seems that the formal representation of plain belief has to take a non-probabilistic route. Indeed, representing plain belief seems easy enough: simply represent an epistemic state by the set of all propositions believed true in it or, since I make the common assumption that plain belief is deductively closed, by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it. But this does not yet provide a theory of induction, i.e.

an answer to the question how epistemic states so represented are changed tbrough information or experience. There is a convincing partial answer: if the new information is compatible with the old epistemic state, then the new epistemic state is simply represented by the conjunction of the new information and the old beliefs. This answer is partial because it does not cover the quite common case where the new information is incompatible with the old beliefs. It is, however, important to complete the answer and to cover this case, too; otherwise, we would not represent plain belief as conigible. The crucial problem is that there is no good completion. When epistemic states are represented simply by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it, the answer cannot be completed; and though there is a lot of fruitful work, no other representation of epistemic states has been proposed, as far as I know, which provides a complete solution to this problem. In this paper, I want to suggest such a solution. In [4], I have more fully argued that this is the only solution, if certain plausible desiderata are to be satisfied. Here, in section 2, I will be content with formally defining and intuitively explaining my proposal. I will compare my proposal with probability theory in section 3. It will turn out that the theory I am proposing is structurally homomorphic to probability theory in important respects and that it is thus equally easily implementable, but moreover computationally simpler. Section 4 contains a very brief comparison with various kinds of logics, in particular conditional logic, with Shackle's functions of potential surprise and related theories, and with the Dempster - Shafer theory of belief functions.","(632, 23)","Inductive reasoning plays a vital role in scientific inquiry by enabling the inference of conclusions from empirical data. Despite its significance, there exist fundamental challenges in explicating the foundations of inductive reasoning. In particular, traditional approaches have used probabilistic frameworks as the primary tool for modeling inductive reasoning. However, this approach has limited application in real-life scenarios, and even fails to provide an adequate explanation for phenomena that involve non-probabilistic or correlated uncertainties. In this paper, we introduce a general non-probabilistic theory of inductive reasoning, which offers a fresh perspective on traditional models of reasoning. Our theory considers inductive reasoning as a process of developing theories about the causal structure of a given phenomenon, and seeks to provide a systematic framework for this process. Our approach considers the problem of inductive reasoning as part of a larger context of decision-making under uncertainty, and utilizes tools from causal inference, game theory, and information theory.

Through the lens of our theory, we can better understand and formalize the process of inductive reasoning. Specifically, we articulate a new framework that identifies the causal structure of a given phenomenon as the key element for making sound inductive inferences, and further explore how this structure can be uncovered. Our framework is founded on the idea that inductive reasoning can be viewed as a game between the reasoner and nature, and that the optimal strategy in this game requires an analysis of the causal structure. We then introduce a new class of models that capture non-probabilistic uncertainties and are well-defined within this framework. These models are shown to be as versatile as probabilistic models in describing inductive reasoning, and in fact, can better capture the nuances of non-probabilistic uncertainties.

Overall, the proposed non-probabilistic theory of inductive reasoning offers a new approach to model and solve complicated inductive inference problems. It leverages advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence to bring us one step closer to achieving a more general understanding of inductive reasoning. We conclude by highlighting some future directions for research, including the challenges in developing new methodologies and applications for the principle of inductive inference. Ultimately, this work is a stepping stone towards deeper insights into the fundamental question of how we do science and build theories in the face of uncertainty.","(413, 16)","Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive  reasoning.

Given a universe of discourse X-a domain of possible outcomes-an experiment may consist of selecting ","Given a universe of discourse X-a domain of possible outcomes-an experiment may consist of selecting one of its elements, subject to the operation of chance, or of observing the elements, subject to imprecision. A priori uncertainty about the actual result of the experiment may be quantified, representing either the likelihood of the choice of :r_X or the degree to which any such X would be suitable as a description of the outcome. The former case corresponds to a probability distribution, while the latter gives a possibility assignment on X. The study of such assignments and their properties falls within the purview of possibility theory [DP88, Y80, Z783. It, like probability theory, assigns values between 0 and 1 to express likelihoods of outcomes.

Here, however, the similarity ends. Possibility theory uses the maximum and minimum functions to combine uncertainties, whereas probability theory uses the plus and times operations. This leads to very dissimilar theories in terms of analytical framework, even though they share several semantic concepts. One of the shared concepts consists of expressing quantitatively the uncertainty associated with a given distribution. In probability theory its value corresponds to the gain of information that would result from conducting an experiment and ascertaining an actual result. This gain of information can equally well be viewed as a decrease in uncertainty about the outcome of an experiment. In this case the standard measure of information, and thus uncertainty, is Shannon entropy [AD75, G77]. It enjoys several advantages-it is characterized uniquely by a few, very natural properties, and it can be conveniently used in decision processes. This application is based on the principle of maximum entropy; it has become a popular method of relating decisions to uncertainty. This paper demonstrates that an equally integrated theory can be built on the foundation of possibility theory. We first show how to define measures of in formation and uncertainty for possibility assignments.

Next we construct an information-based metric on the space of all possibility distributions defined on a given domain. It allows us to capture the notion of proximity in information content among the distributions. Lastly, we show that all the above constructions can be carried out for continuous distributions-possibility assignments on arbitrary measurable domains. We consider this step very significant-finite domains of discourse are but approximations of the real-life infinite domains. If possibility theory is to represent real world situations, it must handle continuous distributions both directly and through finite approximations. In the last section we discuss a principle of maximum uncertainty for possibility distributions. We show how such a principle could be formalized as an inference rule. We also suggest it could be derived as a consequence of simple assumptions about combining information. We would like to mention that possibility assignments can be viewed as fuzzy sets and that every fuzzy set gives rise to an assignment of possibilities. This correspondence has far reaching consequences in logic and in control theory. Our treatment here is independent of any special interpretation; in particular we speak of possibility distributions and possibility measures, defining them as measurable mappings into the interval [0, 1]. Our presentation is intended as a self-contained, albeit terse summary.

Possibilistic rules are commonly used in the fields of artificial intelligence, fuzzy logic, and decision-making. The proposed model aims to provide a means of quantifying the uncertainty inherent in these rules.

To achieve this goal, the model introduces the notion of a possibility distribution function. This function assigns a possibility value to each possible state of the world, representing the degree to which that state is possible given the available evidence and the uncertainty inherent in the possibilistic rules. The model also defines a set of rules for combining possibility values, allowing for the aggregation of uncertain information from multiple sources.

The proposed model provides several key benefits over existing approaches to uncertainty in possibilistic rules. First, it provides a more principled and rigorous mathematical framework for dealing with uncertainty in these rules. Second, it allows for a more flexible representation of uncertainty, enabling the modeling of more complex and nuanced forms of uncertainty. Finally, it enables the use of a wider range of probabilistic inference techniques, allowing for more accurate and efficient decision-making.

To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model, we provide several empirical evaluations. These evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in capturing and reasoning with uncertainty in various scenarios. Specifically, we show that the model can accurately capture uncertainty in complex decision-making tasks, such as medical diagnosis and financial forecasting. We also show that the model is computationally efficient, making it feasible for use in real-world applications.

The initial condition is chosen such that $\{X_i(0)\}_{i\in \mathbb{Z}^d}$ is a shift-invariant and shift-ergodic random field on $[0,\infty)$ with mean $\Theta\in (0,\infty)$ (the evolution preserves the mean). We show that the long-time behavior of this system is the result of a delicate interplay between $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ and $b$, in contrast to systems where the diffusion function is subquadratic. In particular, let $\hat{a}(i,j)={1/2}[a(i,j)+a(j,i)]$, $i,j\in \mathbb{Z}^d$, denote the symmetrized transition kernel. We show that: (A) If $\hat{a}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is recurrent, then for any $b>0$ the system locally dies out. (B) If $\hat{a}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is transient, then there exist $b_*\geq b_2>0$ such that: (B1)d The system converges to an equilibrium $\nu_{\Theta}$ (with mean $\Theta$) if $0<b<b_*$. (B2) The system locally dies out if $b>b_*$. (B3) $\nu_{\Theta}$ has a finite 2nd moment if and only if $0<b<b_2$. (B4) The 2nd moment diverges exponentially fast if and only if $b>b_2$. The equilibrium $\nu_{\Theta}$ is shown to be associated and mixing for all $0<b<b_*$. We argue in favor of the conjecture that $b_*>b_2$. We further conjecture that the system locally dies out at $b=b_*$. For the case where $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is symmetric and transient we further show that: (C) There exists a sequence $b_2\geq b_3\geq b_4\geq ... >0$ such that: (C1) $\nu_{\Theta}$ has a finite $m$th moment if and only if $0<b<b_m$. (C2) The $m$th moment diverges exponentially fast if and only if $b>b_m$. (C3) $b_2\leq (m-1)b_m<2$. uad(C4) $\lim_{m\to\infty}(m-1)b_m=c=\sup_{m\geq 2}(m-1)b_m$. The proof of these results is based on self-duality and on a representation formula through which the moments of the components are related to exponential moments of the collision local time of random walks. Via large deviation theory, the latter lead to variational expressions for $b_*$ and the $b_m$'s, from which sharp bounds are deduced. The critical value $b_*$ arises from a stochastic representation of the Palm distribution of the system. The special case where $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is simple random walk is commonly referred to as the parabolic Anderson model with Brownian noise. This case was studied in the memoir by Carmona and Molchanov [Parabolic Anderson Problem and Intermittency (1994) Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI], where part of our results were already established.","(851, 24)","This research paper investigates phase transitions in the long-time behavior of interacting diffusions. Alongside phase transitions in the Ising model, the authors demonstrate the existence of phase transitions for interacting diffusions in a bounded domain. Specifically, the authors study the asymptotic behavior of the occupation time near the boundary of the domain and the formation of persistent macroscopic clusters. For this purpose, they use representation formulas for occupation times and establish the asymptotics of the same. The authors derive phase diagrams based on the occupation time, and these phase diagrams are quite different from the traditional ones for the Ising model. Furthermore, the authors show that the phase transition for interacting diffusions is much richer than that for the Ising model, as it exhibits a discontinuity phenomenon. They discuss the origin of this discontinuity phenomenon and describe how it arises from a subtle interplay between the sub-diffusive nature of the diffusion process and the interaction among particles.

The authors conduct simulations to verify their analytical results and study the long-time behavior of interacting Brownian particles in a bounded domain. They provide numerical evidence of the existence of multiple phases for the occupation time near the boundary and demonstrate the discontinuity phenomenon of the phase transition. They also observe the emergence of macroscopic clusters in numerical simulations and show that they are responsible for the mentioned discontinuity.

In conclusion, the findings of this research paper demonstrate that the long-time behavior of interacting diffusions exhibits phase transitions that are significantly different from those in the Ising model. The authors establish the existence of a discontinuity phenomenon that is a result of subtle interactions between the sub-diffusive nature of the diffusion process and the interaction among particles.

The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important ","The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Due to the plasma screening effect, the color attraction between the heavy quark antiquark pair inside a quarkonium is significantly suppressed at high temperature and thus no bound states can exist, i.e., they ""melt"". In addition, a bound heavy quark antiquark pair can dissociate if enough energy is transferred to it in a dynamical process inside the plasma. So one would expect the production of quarkonium to be considerably suppressed in heavy ion collisions. However, experimental measurements have shown that a large amount of quarkonia survive the evolution inside the high temperature plasma. It is realized that the in-medium recombination of unbound heavy quark pairs into quarkonium is as crucial as the melting and dissociation. Thus, phenomenological studies have to account for static screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. But recombination is less understood theoretically than the melting and dissociation. Many studies using semi-classical transport equations model the recombination effect from the consideration of detailed balance at thermal equilibrium. However, these studies cannot explain how the system of quarkonium reaches equilibrium and estimate the time scale of the thermalization.

Recently, another approach based on the open quantum system formalism started being used. In this framework, one solves a quantum evolution for in-medium quarkonium. Dissociation and recombination are accounted for consistently.

However, the connection between the semi-classical transport equation and the quantum evolution is not clear. In this dissertation, I will try to address the issues raised above. As a warm-up project, I will first study a similar problem: $\alpha$-$\alpha$ scattering at the $^8$Be resonance inside an $e^-e^+\gamma$ plasma. By applying pionless effective field theory and thermal field theory, I will show how the plasma screening effect modifies the $^8$Be resonance energy and width. I will discuss the need to use the open quantum system formalism when studying the time evolution of a system embedded inside a plasma. Then I will use effective field theory of QCD and the open quantum system formalism to derive a Lindblad equation for bound and unbound heavy quark antiquark pairs inside a weakly-coupled QGP. Under the Markovian approximation and the assumption of weak coupling between the system and the environment, the Lindblad equation will be shown to turn to a Boltzmann transport equation if a Wigner transform is applied to the open system density matrix. These assumptions will be justified by using the separation of scales, which is assumed in the construction of effective field theory. I will show the scattering amplitudes that contribute to the collision terms in the Boltzmann equation are gauge invariant and infrared safe. By coupling the transport equation of quarkonium with those of open heavy flavors and solving them using Monte Carlo simulations, I will demonstrate how the system of bound and unbound heavy quark antiquark pairs reaches detailed balance and equilibrium inside the QGP. Phenomenologically, my calculations can describe the experimental data on bottomonium production. Finally I will extend the framework to study the in-medium evolution of heavy diquarks and estimate the production rate of the doubly charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ in heavy ion collisions.","(600, 25)","Effective Field Theory (EFT) has become an increasingly important tool in the field of nuclear physics, providing a systematic framework for conducting calculations in a range of energy regimes. By treating the nuclear force as a perturbation of an underlying theory, such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), EFT allows for the accurate prediction of observables across a broad range of energies and systems.

In this paper, we review the application of EFT in nuclear physics, discussing its fundamental principles and its use in nuclear structure, nuclear reactions and nuclear astrophysics. We first summarize the basic concepts of EFT, including power counting, renormalization and the operator product expansion, and their applicability to nuclear forces.

We then present several examples of EFT calculations in nuclear structure, including the prediction of ground-state properties, such as binding energies and radii, and excited-state spectra, such as giant resonances and alpha clustering. We demonstrate the advantages of EFT over other approaches, such as shell model and mean-field theory, in providing accurate and systematic descriptions of nuclear phenomena.

Next, we discuss EFT in the context of nuclear reactions, with a focus on low-energy reactions, such as radiative capture and scattering, and their relevance for nuclear astrophysics. We review the formalism of EFT for few-nucleon scattering and its extension to more complex systems, such as those encountered in nuclear astrophysics, and describe its successes in explaining experimental data and predicting astrophysical reaction rates.

Finally, we discuss the future prospects of EFT in nuclear physics, considering its potential impact on our understanding of neutron-rich and exotic nuclei, the physics of the neutron star crust and the equation of state of nuclear matter. We conclude that EFT has emerged as a powerful and versatile tool in nuclear physics, capable of providing accurate and systematic predictions across a range of nuclear phenomena and regimes. Its future impact on nuclear physics is likely to be significant, enabling predictions of unprecedented accuracy for a range of important experiments and observations.","(367, 11)","The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important  tool to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a state of matter that is thought to have existed in the early universe. The QGP is a deconfined state of quarks and gluons, which is characterized by a high temperature and density. The study of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions can provide valuable insights into the properties of the QGP, such as its temperature, density, and viscosity.

Effective Field Theory (EFT) is a powerful tool that can be used to describe the behavior of quarkonium in the QGP. EFT is a theoretical framework that is based on the idea that the strong nuclear force can be described in terms of the exchange of virtual particles, such as gluons and quarks. By using EFT, it is possible to calculate the production rates of quarkonium states in heavy ion collisions, and to study the effects of the QGP on these production rates.

In this paper, we apply EFT to study the production of charmonium (J/ψ) and bottomonium (Upsilon) in heavy ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We use a combination of perturbative and non-perturbative calculations to determine the production rates of these quarkonium states, and we compare our results with experimental data from the ALICE and ATLAS collaborations.

Our calculations show that the production rates of J/ψ and Upsilon are significantly affected by the presence of the QGP. The QGP suppresses the production of these states, particularly at low transverse momentum, due to the Debye screening of the quark-antiquark potential. We find that the suppression of J/ψ production is more pronounced than that of Upsilon production, due to the smaller mass of the charm quark compared to the bottom quark.

We also study the dependence of the quarkonium production rates on the centrality of the collision, which is a measure of the number of nucleons that participate in the collision. Our calculations show that the centrality dependence of the production rates is consistent with the experimental data, and that the QGP plays a significant role in shaping the centrality dependence.

In addition to the production rates, we also study the azimuthal anisotropy of quarkonium produced in heavy ion collisions. The azimuthal distribution of quarkonium is sensitive to the initial conditions of the collision, and can provide valuable information about the geometry of the collision. We use EFT to calculate the azimuthal","(450, 16)","The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important 'smoking gun' for the existence of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).

It is believed to be the state of matter that existed immediately after the Big Bang.

The QGP is a deconfined state of quarks and gluons, which is characterized by a high temperature and density. The study of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions can provide valuable insights into the properties of the QGP, such as its temperature, density, and viscosity.

Effective Field Theory (EFT) is a powerful tool that can be used to describe the behavior of quarkonium in the QGP. EFT is a theoretical framework that is based on the idea that the strong nuclear force can be described in terms of the exchange of virtual particles, such as gluons and quarks. By using EFT, it is possible to calculate the production rates of quarkonium states in heavy ion collisions, and to study the effects of the QGP on these production rates.

In this paper, we apply EFT to study the production of charmonium (J/ψ) and bottomonium (Upsilon) in heavy ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We use a combination of perturbative and non-perturbative calculations to determine the production rates of these quarkonium states, and we compare our results with experimental data from the ALICE and ATLAS collaborations.

Our calculations show that the production rates of J/ψ and Upsilon are significantly affected by the presence of the QGP. The QGP suppresses the production of these states, particularly at low transverse momentum, due to the Debye screening of the quark-antiquark potential. We find that the suppression of J/ψ production is more pronounced than that of Upsilon production, due to the smaller mass of the charm quark compared to the bottom quark.

We also study the dependence of the quarkonium production rates on the centrality of the collision, which is a measure of the number of nucleons that participate in the collision. Our calculations show that the centrality dependence of the production rates is consistent with the experimental data, and that the QGP plays a significant role in shaping the centrality dependence.

In addition to the production rates, we also study the azimuthal anisotropy of quarkonium produced in heavy ion collisions. The azimuthal distribution of quarkonium is sensitive to the initial conditions of the collision, and can provide valuable information about the geometry of the collision.

Context. The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three pillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions ","Context. The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three pillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions ("" cold chemistry ""), endothermic neutral-neutral reactions with significant activation barriers ("" warm chemistry ""), and reactions on the surfaces of dust grains. While warm chemistry becomes important in the shocks associated with turbulent dissipation regions, the main path for the formation of interstellar OH and H2O is that of cold chemistry. Aims. The aim of this study is to observationally confirm the association of atomic oxygen with both atomic and molecular gas phases, and to understand the measured abundances of OH and OH + as a function of the available reservoir of H2. Methods. We obtained absorption spectra of the ground states of OH, OH+ and OI with high-velocity resolution, with GREAT on-board SOFIA, and with the THz receiver at the APEX. We analyzed them along with ancillary spectra of HF and CH from HIFI. To deconvolve them from the hyperfine structure and to separate the blend that is due to various velocity components on the sightline, we fit model spectra consisting of an appropriate number of Gaussian profiles using a method combining simulated annealing with downhill simplex minimization. Together with HF and/or CH as a surrogate for H2, and HI $\lambda$21 cm data, the molecular hydrogen fraction f^N\_H2 = N(H 2)/(N(H) + 2N(H 2)) can be determined. We then investigated abundance ratios as a function of f^N\_H2. Results. The column density of OI is correlated at a high significance with the amount of available molecular and atomic hydrogen, with an atomic oxygen abundance of $3 \times 10 ^{-4}$ relative to H nuclei.

While the velocities of the absorption features of OH and OH+ are loosely correlated and reflect the spiral arm crossings on the sightline, upon closer inspection they display an anticorrespondence. The arm-to-interarm density contrast is found to be higher in OH than in OH+. While both species can coexist, with a higher abundance in OH than in OH+, the latter is found less frequently in absence of OH than the other way around, which is a direct consequence of the rapid destruction of OH+ by dissociative recombination when not enough H2 is available. This conjecture has been substantiated by a comparison between the OH/OH+ ratio with f^N\_H2, showing a clear correlation.

The hydrogen abstraction reaction chain OH+ (H2,H) H2O+ (H2,H)H3O+ is confirmed as the pathway for the production of OH and H 2 O. Our estimate of the branching ratio of the dissociative recombination of H3O+ to OH and H2O is confined within the interval of 84 to 91%, which matches laboratory measurements (74 to 83%). -- A correlation between the linewidths and column densities of OH+ features is found to be significant with a false-alarm probability below 5%. Such a correlation is predicted by models of interstellar MHD turbulence. For OH the same correlation is found to be insignificant because there are more narrow absorption features. Conclusions. While it is difficult to assess the contributions of warm neutral-neutral chemistry to the observed abundances, it seems fair to conclude that the predictions of cold ion-neutral chemistry match the abundance patterns we observed.","(603, 24)","This study presents an analysis of far-infrared observational data to detect tracers of oxygen chemistry in diffuse clouds. Diffuse clouds have low density and are primarily composed of atomic hydrogen, with small amounts of He, C, N, O, etc. Despite their low density, these clouds contain a significant fraction of the interstellar gas in our galaxy. The chemical evolution of diffuse clouds is fundamentally different from that of dense clouds, and the key chemical processes that control their physical characteristics are not yet fully understood. The far-infrared spectral range is key to unveil the composition and chemical properties of these clouds.

We analyzed far-infrared spectral data acquired using the Herschel Space Observatory to measure major cooling lines from the oxygen chemistry in diffuse clouds. The excitation of these lines frequently emerges from chemical processes that originate from photoabsorption or photoionization by far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons. The set of observed cooling lines and their relative intensities can, in principle, provide constraints on the physical conditions, composition, and life cycle of diffuse clouds.

Our analysis focused on a sample of known diffuse clouds whose spectroscopic features show clear evidence for the presence of atomic and molecular tracers of the gas-phase oxygen chemistry. Oxygen molecules such as O$_2$, O$_3$, and CO are the strongest tracers due to their high abundance and relative stability at low density. Our goal was to use the cooling lines from these tracers to constrain the physical and chemical properties of the diffuse clouds and to investigate variations in the gas-phase oxygen chemistry in different environments of the Milky Way.

Our analysis yielded several key results. First, we detected parent and daughter cooling lines from O$_3$ and O$_2$ with the highest signal-to-noise ratio among the observed features. This suggests that O$_3$ and O$_2$ are the most efficient cooling mechanisms in FUV-illuminated diffuse clouds. Second, we found empirical correlations between the relative cooling line intensities and the FUV radiation field strength in our sample. These correlations provide important constraints on the chemical and physical evolution of the diffuse clouds. Finally, we detected the CO fundamental transitions at 4.7 and 2.6 THz in several sources, consistent with previous detections of CO in diffuse clouds.

Our results demonstrate the power and importance of far-infrared studies for understanding the composition and chemical properties of diffuse clouds. Our analysis of the various tracers of oxygen chemistry in these clouds can provide constraints on the formation, physical properties, and evolution of diffuse clouds in different regions of the galaxy. Furthermore, our empirical correlations suggest that FUV radiation fields play an essential role in regulating the physical conditions and chemical properties of diffuse clouds. Our findings can inform future studies of the chemical and physical evolution of molecular gas in the Universe.","(516, 21)","Context. The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three pillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions 1, endothermic neutral-neutral reactions 2, and photodissociation 3. Among these processes, oxygen chemistry plays a pivotal role in shaping the chemical composition of diffuse clouds. Despite its significance, the far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy of oxygen-bearing species in these environments remains poorly understood. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the FIR spectra of key oxygen tracers in diffuse clouds.

Methodology. We employed the Herschel Space Observatory's Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI) to observe the FIR spectra of several oxygen-bearing species, including OH, O2, and H2O, in a sample of diffuse clouds. The observations were conducted in the frequency range of 480-1900 GHz, allowing us to probe the rotational transitions of these molecules. The data were reduced and analyzed using standard techniques, including spectral line fitting and radiative transfer modeling.

Findings. Our observations reveal a wealth of new information on the FIR spectra of oxygen-bearing compounds in diffuse clouds. Specifically, we detected numerous rotational transitions of OH and O2, which were not previously known to be present in these environments. The observed spectra exhibit complex line profiles, indicating the presence of multiple velocity components within each cloud. Radiative transfer modeling suggests that these velocity components arise from variations in the cloud's density and temperature structure. We also report the first detection of H2O in a diffuse cloud, with a column density of approximately 10^14 cm^-2.

Implications. The results of this study have significant implications for our understanding of oxygen chemistry in the diffuse interstellarmedium. Firstly, the detection of OH and O_2 in diffuse clouds highlights the importance of these species as tracers of oxygen abundance in these environments. Secondly, the observed FIR spectra provide a unique window into the physical and chemical conditions within diffuse clouds, allowing us to constrain models of cloud formation and evolution. Finally, the detection of H_2 O in a diffuse cloud suggests that this molecule may play a more significant role in the chemistry of these environments than previously thought.

Discussion. Our findings are consistent with recent studies suggesting that diffuse clouds are more chemically complex than previously believed. The presence of oxygen-bearing species such as OH, O_2, and H_2 O implies that these clouds are capable of supporting a wide range of chemical reactions, including those involving oxygen. This, in turn, suggests that diffuse clouds may be more effective at producing complex organic molecules than previously thought.

In [12], Nilsson proposed the probabilistic logic in which the truth values of logical propositions ","In [12], Nilsson proposed the probabilistic logic in which the truth values of logical propositions are probability values between 0 and 1. It is applicable to any logical system for which the consistency of a finite set of propositions can be established. The probabilistic inference scheme reduces to the ordinary logical inference when the probabilities of all propositions are either 0 or 1. This logic has the same limitations of other probabilistic reasoning systems of the Bayesian approach. For common sense reasoning, consistency is not a very natural assumption. We have some well known examples: {Dick is a Quaker, Quakers are pacifists, Republicans are not pacifists, Dick is a Republican}and {Tweety is a bird, birds can fly, Tweety is a penguin}. In this paper, we shall propose some extensions of the probabilistic logic. In the second section, we shall consider the space of all interpretations, consistent or not. In terms of frames of discernment, the basic probability assignment (bpa) and belief function can be defined. Dempster's combination rule is applicable. This extension of probabilistic logic is called the evidential logic in [ 1]. For each proposition s, its belief function is represented by an interval [Spt(s), Pls(s)]. When all such intervals collapse to single points, the evidential logic reduces to probabilistic logic (in the generalized version of not necessarily consistent interpretations). Certainly, we get Nilsson's probabilistic logic by further restricting to consistent interpretations. In the third section, we shall give a probabilistic interpretation of probabilistic logic in terms of multi-dimensional random variables. This interpretation brings the probabilistic logic into the framework of probability theory. Let us consider a finite set S = {sl, s2, ..., Sn) of logical propositions. Each proposition may have true or false values; and may be considered as a random variable. We have a probability distribution for each proposition. The e-dimensional random variable (sl,..., Sn) may take values in the space of all interpretations of 2n binary vectors. We may compute absolute (marginal), conditional and joint probability distributions. It turns out that the permissible probabilistic interpretation vector of Nilsson [12] consists of the joint probabilities of S. Inconsistent interpretations will not appear, by setting their joint probabilities to be zeros. By summing appropriate joint probabilities, we get probabilities of individual propositions or subsets of propositions. Since the Bayes formula and other techniques are valid for e-dimensional random variables, the probabilistic logic is actually very close to the Bayesian inference schemes. In the last section, we shall consider a relaxation scheme for probabilistic logic. In this system, not only new evidences will update the belief measures of a collection of propositions, but also constraint satisfaction among these propositions in the relational network will revise these measures. This mechanism is similar to human reasoning which is an evaluative process converging to the most satisfactory result. The main idea arises from the consistent labeling problem in computer vision. This method is originally applied to scene analysis of line drawings. Later, it is applied to matching, constraint satisfaction and multi sensor fusion by several authors [8], [16] (and see references cited there). Recently, this method is used in knowledge aggregation by Landy and Hummel [9].","(629, 31)","Probabilistic logic has proven to be a powerful tool for dealing with uncertainty and reasoning under incomplete or inconsistent information. This paper explores some extensions of probabilistic logic that have been proposed in the literature, with a focus on probabilistic defeasible reasoning, Bayesian knowledge bases, and probabilistic programming.

Probabilistic defeasible reasoning extends classical defeasible reasoning to handle uncertain knowledge, allowing the derivation of conclusions that are not necessarily warranted by the premises but are still plausible given the available evidence. We review several approaches to probabilistic defeasible reasoning, including probabilistic argumentation, maximum entropy-based inference, and Bayesian networks with uncertain evidence.

Bayesian knowledge bases combine probabilistic logic with ontology representation to model uncertain and incomplete knowledge about a domain. We discuss the main features of Bayesian knowledge bases, including hierarchical structure, probabilistic axioms, and inference algorithms. We also examine some applications of Bayesian knowledge bases in natural language understanding, diagnosis, and prediction.

Probabilistic programming is a recent paradigm for defining probabilistic models and conducting probabilistic inference via computer programs. We introduce the basic concepts of probabilistic programming, including random variables, conditioning, and inference. We outline some of the key challenges in developing efficient and expressive probabilistic programming languages, such as handling the combination of discrete and continuous probability distributions, dealing with large-scale probabilistic models, and designing effective inference algorithms.

We then discuss some open research questions and opportunities in the area of probabilistic logic extensions. One promising direction is to study the integration of probabilistic logic with other probabilistic models, such as decision networks, relational models, and time series models. Another direction is to investigate the foundations of probabilistic logic and its connections with other areas of logic and mathematics, such as paraconsistent logic, nonstandard analysis, and category theory.

Finally, we conclude by highlighting the potential impact and practical applications of probabilistic logic extensions in various fields, such as artificial intelligence, cognitive science, biology, economics, and social sciences. We argue that the development of advanced probabilistic reasoning techniques and tools is crucial for addressing complex real-world problems that involve uncertainty, ambiguity, and incomplete data.","(390, 15)","In [12], Nilsson proposed the probabilistic logic in which the truth values of logical propositions  are represented by real numbers between 0 and 1. However, the probabilistic logic has some limitations. For example, it does not allow for the representation of uncertainty in the truth values of atomic propositions. In this paper, we propose some extensions of probabilistic logic to overcome these limitations.

Our research question is: How can we extend probabilistic logic to represent uncertainty in the truth value of atomic propositions? To answer this question, we first review the existing probabilistic logic and identify its limitations. We then propose three extensions to probabilistic logic: (1) fuzzy probabilistic logic, (2) interval-valued probabilistic logic, and (3) Dempster-Shafer theory-based probabilistic logic.

Fuzzy probabilistic logic extends probabilistic logic by allowing the truth value of an atomic proposition to be a fuzzy set. A fuzzy set is a set whose elements have degrees of membership. In fuzzy probabilistic logic, the truth value of a proposition is represented by a fuzzy number, which is a fuzzy set with a single peak. Fuzzy probabilistic logic allows for the representation of partial truth, which is not possible in traditional probabilistic logic. For example, consider the proposition ""It is likely that it will rain tomorrow."" In traditional probabilistic logic, the truth value of this proposition would be either 0 or 1, depending on whether it will rain or not. However, in real life, the weather is often uncertain, and it is possible that it will rain partially. Fuzzy probability logic allows us to represent this uncertainty by assigning a fuzzy number to the proposition, such as 0.7, indicating that there is a 70% chance that it will rain, but not necessarily to the extent of 100%.

Interval-Valued Probabilistic Logic (IVPL) is another extension of probabilistic logic. In IVPL, each proposition is associated with an interval of possible truth values, rather than a single value. This allows for more nuanced representation of uncertainty, as the interval can capture both the lower and upper bounds of the truth value. For instance, the proposition ""There is a high probability that the stock market will go up tomorrow"" can be represented by an interval [0.6, 0.9], indicating that the probability of the stock market going up is at least 60% and at most 90%.

Using nCB films adsorbed on MoS 2 substrates studied by x-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and ","Using nCB films adsorbed on MoS 2 substrates studied by x-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, we demonstrate that ordered interfaces with well-defined orientations of adsorbed dipoles induce planar anchoring locked along the adsorbed dipoles or the alkyl chains, which play the role of easy axes. For two alternating orientations of the adsorbed dipoles or dipoles and alkyl chains, bi-stability of anchoring can be obtained.

The results are explained using the introduction of fourth order terms in the phenomenological anchoring potential, leading to the demonstration of first order anchoring transition in these systems. Using this phenomenological anchoring potential, we finally show how the nature of anchoring in presence of dual easy axes (inducing bi-stability or average orientation between the two easy axes) can be related to the microscopical nature of the interface.

Introduction Understanding the interactions between liquid crystal (LC) and a solid substrate is of clear applied interest, the vast majority of LC displays relying on control of interfaces. However this concerns also fundamental problems like wetting phenomena and all phenomena of orientation of soft matter bulk induced by the presence of an interface. In LCs at interfaces, the so-called easy axes correspond to the favoured orientations of the LC director close to the interface. If one easy axis only is defined for one given interface, the bulk director orients along or close to this axis [1]. It is well known that, in anchoring phenomena, two major effects compete to impose the anchoring directions of a liquid crystal, first, the interactions between molecules and the interface, second, the substrate roughness whose role has been analyzed by Berreman [2]. The influence of adsorbed molecular functional groups at the interface is most often dominant with, for example in carbon substrates, a main influence of unsaturated carbon bonds orientation at the interface [3]. In common LC displays, there is one unique easy axis, but modifications of surfaces have allowed for the discovery of promising new anchoring-related properties. For instance, the first anchoring bi-stability has been established on rough surfaces, associated with electric ordo-polarization [4] and the competition between a stabilizing short-range term and a destabilizing long-range term induced by an external field, can induce a continuous variation of anchoring orientation [5]. More recently, surfaces with several easy axes have been studied extensively. It has been shown that control of a continuous variation of director pretilt, obtained in several systems [6, 7], is associated with the presence of two different easy axes, one perpendicular to the substrate (homeotropic) and one planar [7, 8].

Similar models can explain the continuous evolution of anchoring between two planar orientations observed on some crystalline substrates [9]. However, in the same time, two easy axes can also lead to anchoring bi-stability [10, 11] or discontinuous transitions of anchoring [9], which is not compatible with the model established to interpret observed control of pretilt. In order to be able to predict if bi-stability or continuous combination of the two easy axes occurs for one given system, it becomes necessary to understand the microscopic origin of the easy axes.","(587, 17)","In this paper, we investigate the characteristics and behavior of ordered interfaces in liquid crystals with dual easy axes. This combination of properties is known to induce a number of complex and interesting phenomena, including domain formation, phase transitions, and the emergence of topological defects.

To begin, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of dual easy axes in nematic liquid crystals. We describe the different types of ordering that can occur in these systems, including homogenous and patterned alignments. We also discuss how external fields and boundary conditions can be used to control and manipulate the ordering of the liquid crystal.

We then turn our attention to the experimental study of dual easy axes in liquid crystals. Using a combination of microscopy and scattering techniques, we analyze the structures and dynamics of ordered interfaces. We find that the ordering of the liquid crystal displays a rich variety of behavior, including the formation of complex textures such as stripes and walls.

One particularly interesting phenomenon that arises from the combination of dual easy axes and ordered interfaces is the formation of topological defects. These defects can take on a number of different forms, including disclinations and dislocations, and have been shown to have important implications for the properties and behavior of the liquid crystal.

We also investigate the effect of confined geometries on the ordering of dual easy axes in liquid crystals. By studying the behavior of these systems in thin films and droplets, we are able to gain insight into how the ordering is affected by the presence of surfaces and interfaces. We find that the confinement induces a number of new and unexpected effects, including the formation of new types of topological defects and the emergence of novel phase behavior.

Overall, our study demonstrates that the combination of dual easy axes and ordered interfaces in liquid crystals is a rich and complex field of study with a number of important implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. Our research contributes to a growing body of knowledge on these fascinating systems and paves the way for future research in this area.","(383, 15)","Using nCB films adsorbed on MoS 2 substrates studied by x-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and 2D grazing incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS), we have investigated the formation of ordered interfaces in liquid crystals (LCs) with dual easy axes. Our research aims to elucidate the structural and optical properties of these interfaces, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of LCs in various applications, including displays, sensors, and optoelectronic devices.

The study of LCs with dual easy axes has garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique properties, such as bistability and reconfigurability. However, the formation and characterization of ordered interfaces in these systems remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we have employed a combination of experimental techniques to investigate the structure and optical properties of LCs adsorbed on nCB films deposited on MoS2 substrates.

Our results show that the nCB films exhibit a high degree of order, with a well-defined hexagonal lattice structure. The GISAXS measurements reveal that the LC molecules align parallel to the nCB film surface, forming a uniform layer with a thickness of approximately 100 nm. The optical microscopy images demonstrate that the LCs exhibit a homeotropic alignment, with the long axes of the molecules perpendicular to the substrate.

The 2D GISAXS patterns obtained from the LC/nCB/MoS2 system show a characteristic four-fold symmetry, indicating the presence of a chiral nematic phase. The azimuthal dependence of the GISAXS intensity reveals that the LC molecules exhibit a dual easy axis behavior, with the easy axes aligned along the [110] and [1-10] directions of the nCB film. This behavior is attributed to the anisotropic interactions between the LC molecules and the nCB film.

Our findings have significant implications for the development of LC-based devices, particularly those that require bistable or reconfigurable properties.

Virtualization allows the simulation of automotive ECUs on a Windows PC executing in closed-loop with ","Virtualization allows the simulation of automotive ECUs on a Windows PC executing in closed-loop with a vehicle simulation model. This approach enables to move certain development tasks from road or test rigs and HiL (Hardware in the loop) to PCs, where they can often be performed faster and cheaper. Renault has recently established such a virtualization process for powertrain control software based on Simulink models. If the number of runnables exceeds a threshold (about 1500) the execution of the virtual ECU is no longer straight forward and specific techniques are required. This paper describes the motivation behind a Simulink model based process, the virtualization process and applications of the resulting virtual ECUs. Domain: Critical Transportation Systems Topic: Processes, methods and tools, in particular: virtual engineering and simulation 1. Motivation Since 2010, Renault has established a framework to develop engine control software for Diesel and Gasoline engines [6]. The framework is heavily based on MATLAB/Simulink and the idea of model-based development, which facilitates the carry-over and carry-across of application software between software projects. In the Renault EMS architecture software is composed in to about 20 functions, such as Air System, Combustion etc. A function consists of modules. A module is the smallest testable software unit and contains runnables to be scheduled and executed by the Operating System (Os) of the ECU. The Renault EMS development process includes basically the following steps [5]. 1. Specification of about 200 generic configurable modules per ECU using MATLAB/Simulink. 2. Generation of C code (EMS application software) from all module specifications using MATLAB/Simulink Embedded Coder.

3. MiL (Model in the Loop) test and validation of the resulting executable specifications at module level in a simulated system environment, considering only essential interactions with other modules and system environment. This is essentially a back-to-back test to make sure that the Simulink model of a module and the corresponding production C code show equivalent and intended behaviour. To insure software quality, this step is repeatedly performed with steps 1 and 2, based on the simulation capabilities of MATLAB/Simulink. 4.

Configuration of modules to fit to the specific needs of a software project, such as absence or presence of certain components. 5. Integration of generated configured C code and hand-coded platform software (basic software) on supplied target hardware, a real ECU that communicates with other controllers via CAN and other busses. 6. Validation and test of all modules on system level using the real ECU. In contrast to step 3, the interactions of all modules and interactions with the system environment are visible then and subject to testing. For example, the Os runs all scheduled runnables then, not just those of the modules considered to be 'essential' for a module under test. Critical assessment of the above process shows that there is a considerable delay between delivery of a set of specifications to the software project team (at the end of step 3) and system-level tests based on an ECU that runs entire software (step 6). Typical delays are weeks or months.","(572, 30)","This paper presents a comprehensive study on the full virtualization of Renault's engine management software and its application to system development. The aim of the research is to investigate the feasibility of complete system virtualization for engine control systems, which will allow more flexibility and assess the practicality of this approach for software development in the automotive industry.

To achieve this goal, a detailed analysis of the Renault engine management system architecture is performed, including its various components and sub-systems. This analysis helps identify the key characteristics and features that require consideration when creating a virtualized system.

The research then proposes a virtualization architecture based on various virtualization techniques, such as hardware-level virtualization, kernel-level virtualization, and system-level virtualization. This architecture is designed specifically for Renault's engine management system, taking into account the unique characteristics of the system.

Several virtualization prototypes are developed and implemented on the proposed architecture to identify potential issues in the virtualization process and to evaluate the performance of the virtualized system. The results of these tests show that full virtualization of Renault's engine management software is feasible and can be a promising approach for system development in the automotive industry.

Furthermore, the paper explores the benefits of virtualization in relation to software development and analyzes the potential implications for Renault's development process. The paper highlights the potential for quicker development cycles, improved software testing, and better fault isolation among other benefits. Moreover, through this virtualization, developers can build, test, and deploy various software updates to Renault engines more efficiently.

To answer this question, we employed a mixed-methods approach combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods.

First, we conducted a literature review to identify the current state of the art in virtualization and its applications in the automotive industry. This review revealed that while virtualization has been widely adopted in the IT sector, its application in the automotive industry is still in its infancy. However, there is a growing interest in using virtualization to simulate and test automotive ECUs, including engine management systems.

We worked closely with Renault's engineers to gain access to the EMS source code and to understand the system's architecture and functionality. We then used a commercial virtualization tool to create a virtualized environment for the EMS, which allowed us to simulate the system's behavior on a Windows PC.

The virtualized EMS was then tested and validated using a range of scenarios, including steady-state and transient conditions. The results showed that the virtualized EMS was able to accurately simulate the behavior of the real system, with a high degree of correlation between the simulated and actual data.

One Monad to Prove Them All is a modern fairy tale about curiosity and perseverance, ","One Monad to Prove Them All is a modern fairy tale about curiosity and perseverance, two important properties of a successful PhD student. We follow the PhD student Mona on her adventure of proving properties about Haskell programs in the proof assistant Coq. On the one hand, as a PhD student in computer science Mona observes an increasing demand for correct software products. In particular, because of the large amount of existing software, verifying existing software products becomes more important. Verifying programs in the functional programming language Haskell is no exception. On the other hand, Mona is delighted to see that communities in the area of theorem proving are becoming popular. Thus, Mona sets out to learn more about the interactive theorem prover Coq and verifying Haskell programs in Coq. To prove properties about a Haskell function in Coq, Mona has to translate the function into Coq code. As Coq programs have to be total and Haskell programs are often not, Mona has to model partiality explicitly in Coq. In her quest for a solution Mona finds an ancient manuscript that explains how properties about Haskell functions can be proven in the proof assistant Agda by translating Haskell programs into monadic Agda programs. By instantiating the monadic program with a concrete monad instance the proof can be performed in either a total or a partial setting. Mona discovers that the proposed transformation does not work in Coq due to a restriction in the termination checker. In fact the transformation does not work in Agda anymore as well, as the termination checker in Agda has been improved. We follow Mona on an educational journey through the land of functional programming where she learns about concepts like free monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof assistants like Coq. These concepts are well-known individually, but their interplay gives rise to a solution for Mona's problem based on the originally proposed monadic tranformation that has not been presented before. When Mona starts to test her approach by proving a statement about simple Haskell functions, she realizes that her approach has an additional advantage over the original idea in Agda. Mona's final solution not only works for a specific monad instance but even allows her to prove monad-generic properties. Instead of proving properties over and over again for specific monad instances she is able to prove properties that hold for all monads representable by a container-based instance of the free monad. In order to strengthen her confidence in the practicability of her approach, Mona evaluates her approach in a case study that compares two implementations for queues. In order to share the results with other functional programmers the fairy tale is available as a literate Coq file. If you are a citizen of the land of functional programming or are at least familiar with its customs, had a journey that involved reasoning about functional programs of your own, or are just a curious soul looking for the next story about monads and proofs, then this tale is for you.","(546, 21)","The concept of a ""monad"" has been used across multiple fields and disciplines throughout history, from Western philosophy to computer science. In this paper, we examine the concept of a monad and its applications in various areas of science.

We begin with a historical overview of the term, exploring its origins in the writings of Plato and Aristotle and its development over time. From there, we move into an examination of the ways in which the idea of a monad has been used in mathematics, particularly in calculus and topology.

Moving beyond mathematics, we explore the use of monads in physics, including its application in quantum mechanics and string theory. We also examine the concept of a monad in chemistry, considering its role in the development of new materials and its potential for creating new molecules through precisely controlled reactions.

In the field of computer science, monads have been used as a way to structure functional programming languages. We explore the use of monads in Haskell and Scala, two prominent functional programming languages, and discuss the advantages they provide in terms of code reusability and modularity.

Finally, we consider the potential applications of monads in the field of artificial intelligence. We explore how monads could be used to model complex systems, such as the human brain, and how they could be used to develop more efficient algorithms for machine learning and natural language processing.

Overall, our paper argues that the concept of a monad has far-reaching applications across a variety of scientific disciplines. By exploring the different ways in which the concept has been used, we hope to provide a deeper understanding of this fundamental idea and its potential for shaping the future of science and technology.","(317, 12)","One Monad to Prove Them All is a modern fairy tale about curiosity and perseverance,  but in this paper, we delve into the realm of theoretical computer science to explore the concept of a single monad that can unify various programming paradigms. Our research question is: Can we design a monad that serves as a bridge between different programming languages and paradigms, allowing for seamless integration and interoperability?

To address this question, we employed a multi-disciplinary approach, combining insights from category theory, type theory, and programming language design. We began by surveying existing monads in various programming languages, including Haskell, Scala, and Rust, to identify commonalities and differences. This analysis revealed that while monads share a common structure, their implementations often diverge due to language-specific constraints and design choices.

Building on this foundation, we developed a novel monad, which we call the ""Unified Monad"" (UM). The UM is designed to be extensible, composable, and modular, allowing it to adapt to diverse programming paradigms and languages. We defined the UM using a combination of category theory and type theory, ensuring that it satisfies the fundamental properties of a monad, such as associativity and left and right unit laws.

To demonstrate the UM's versatility, we implemented it in three distinct programming languages: a functional language (Haskell), an object-oriented language (Java), and a multi-paradigm language (Rust). In each implementation, we showcased the UM's ability to integrate with existing language features, such as type systems, concurrency models, and error handling mechanisms. Our results indicate that the UM can indeed serve as a unifying abstraction, enabling seamless communication and cooperation between different programming paradigms.

One of the key findings of our research is that the UM's extensibility and modularity allow it to accommodate a wide range of programming styles and idioms. For instance, in the Haskell implementation, we demonstrated how the UM can be used to implement a monadic parser combinator library, while in the Java implementation, we showed how it can be used to create a monadic framework for concurrent programming. These examples highlight the UM's potential to bridge the gap between different programming cultures and facilitate collaboration among developers from diverse backgrounds.

Our results also have significant implications for the field of programming language design. By providing a unified abstraction for monads, the UM offers a new perspective on the design of programming languages and systems. We argue that the UM can serve as a foundation for the development of more expressive and flexible programming languages, which can better support the needs of modern software development.

In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized function. Choosing a neural network ","In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized function. Choosing a neural network architecture for any task is as complex as searching the space of those functions. For the last few years, 'neural architecture design' has been largely synonymous with 'neural architecture search' (NAS), i.e. brute-force, large-scale search. NAS has yielded significant gains on practical tasks. However, NAS methods end up searching for a local optimum in architecture space in a small neighborhood around architectures that often go back decades, based on CNN or LSTM.

In this work, we present a different and complementary approach to architecture design, which we term 'zero-shot architecture design' (ZSAD). We develop methods that can predict, without any training, whether an architecture will achieve a relatively high test or training error on a task after training.

We then go on to explain the error in terms of the architecture definition itself and develop tools for modifying the architecture based on this explanation. This confers an unprecedented level of control on the deep learning practitioner. They can make informed design decisions before the first line of code is written, even for tasks for which no prior art exists.

Our first major contribution is to show that the 'degree of nonlinearity' of a neural architecture is a key causal driver behind its performance, and a primary aspect of the architecture's model complexity. We introduce the 'nonlinearity coefficient' (NLC), a scalar metric for measuring nonlinearity.

Via extensive empirical study, we show that the value of the NLC in the architecture's randomly initialized state before training is a powerful predictor of test error after training and that attaining a right-sized NLC is essential for attaining an optimal test error. The NLC is also conceptually simple, well-defined for any feedforward network, easy and cheap to compute, has extensive theoretical, empirical and conceptual grounding, follows instructively from the architecture definition, and can be easily controlled via our 'nonlinearity normalization' algorithm. We argue that the NLC is the most powerful scalar statistic for architecture design specifically and neural network analysis in general. Our analysis is fueled by mean field theory, which we use to uncover the 'meta-distribution' of layers.

Beyond the NLC, we uncover and flesh out a range of metrics and properties that have a significant explanatory influence on test and training error. We go on to explain the majority of the error variation across a wide range of randomly generated architectures with these metrics and properties. We compile our insights into a practical guide for architecture designers, which we argue can significantly shorten the trial-and-error phase of deep learning deployment.

Our results are grounded in an experimental protocol that exceeds that of the vast majority of other deep learning studies in terms of carefulness and rigor.

We study the impact of e.g. dataset, learning rate, floating-point precision, loss function, statistical estimation error and batch inter-dependency on performance and other key properties. We promote research practices that we believe can significantly accelerate progress in architecture design research.","(565, 24)","The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been revolutionized by the concept of the nonlinearity coefficient (NLC). The NLC is a measure of the nonlinearity of the activation functions used in the hidden layers of an ANN. The use of an optimal NLC value in designing ANNs can improve their performance by minimizing overfitting and increasing generalization accuracy.

In this paper, we present a practical guide to designing neural architectures using the NLC. We begin with an overview of the fundamental concepts of ANNs and their activation functions. We then introduce the concept of the NLC and explain how it can be determined for a given ANN architecture. 

Next, we present experimental results based on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the NLC in improving the performance of ANNs. We also compare the performance of ANNs designed using the NLC with those designed using other traditional methods, such as regularization and early stopping.

Furthermore, we provide guidelines for selecting an appropriate NLC value based on the complexity of the dataset, the size of the training dataset, and the optimization algorithm used.

Lastly, we discuss the limitations of using the NLC in neural architecture design, such as the high computational cost of calculating NLC and the dependence of the optimal NLC on the dataset and architecture used.

User-defined syntax extensions are useful to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) with good ","User-defined syntax extensions are useful to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) with good code-readability. They allow EDSL authors to define domain-natural notation, which is often different from the host language syntax. Nowadays, there are several research works of powerful user-defined syntax extensions. One promising approach uses user-defined operators. A user-defined operator is a function with user-defined syntax. It can be regarded as a syntax extension implemented without macros. An advantage of user-defined operators is that an operator can be statically typed. The compiler can find type errors in the definition of an operator before the operator is used. In addition, the compiler can resolve syntactic ambiguities by using static types. However, user-defined operators are difficult to implement language constructs involving static name binding. Name binding is association between names and values (or memory locations). Our inquiry is whether we can design a system for user-defined operators involving a new custom name binding. This paper proposes a module system for user-defined operators named a dsl class. A dsl class is similar to a normal class in Java but it contains operators instead of methods. We use operators for implementing custom name binding. For example, we use a nullary operator for emulating a variable name. An instance of a dsl class, called a dsl object, reifies an environment that expresses name binding. Programmers can control a scope of instance operators by specifying where the dsl object is active. We extend the host type system so that it can express the activation of a dsl object. In our system, a bound name is propagated through a type parameter to a dsl object.

This enables us to implement user-defined language constructs involving static name binding. A contribution of this paper is that we reveal we can integrate a system for managing names and their scopes with a module and type system of an object-oriented language like Java. This allows us to implement a proposed system by adopting eager disambiguation based on expected types so that the compilation time will be acceptable. Eager disambiguation, which prunes out semantically invalid abstract parsing trees (ASTs) while a parser is running, is needed because the parser may generate a huge number of potentially valid ASTs for the same source code. We have implemented ProteaJ2, which is a programming language based on Java and it supports our proposal. We describe a parsing method that adopts eager disambiguation for fast parsing and discuss its time complexity. To show the practicality of our proposal, we have conducted two micro benchmarks to see the performance of our compiler. We also show several use cases of dsl classes for demonstrating dsl classes can express various language constructs. Our ultimate goal is to let programmers add any kind of new language construct to a host language. To do this, programmers should be able to define new syntax, name binding, and type system within the host language. This paper shows programmers can define the former two: their own syntax and name binding.","(552, 31)","This paper discusses the implementation of user-defined operators and name binding for new language constructs. The proposed approach allows programmers to define their own operators, customized to the domain-specific needs of their applications. The main goal is to enable a concise and natural expression of complex operations, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.

The paper presents a formal specification of the syntax and semantics of the proposed extension, and provides a reference implementation based on a modified version of an existing language. The operators are defined using a declarative syntax similar to that of functions or procedures. The syntax specifies the precedence and associativity of the operators, as well as their arity and argument types. The implementation uses a parser generator to automatically generate a parser for the extended grammar.

To enable name binding for user-defined operators, the paper proposes a novel mechanism that uses a combination of dynamic scoping and type inference. The mechanism allows the compiler to infer the types and binding scopes of variables based on their usage within the operator, thus avoiding the need for explicit type annotations or variable declarations. This makes the programming model more expressive and less error-prone, while still preserving type safety and compile-time correctness.

The paper also discusses the benefits and limitations of the proposed approach, and presents several examples of how the new operators can be used to simplify and clarify program logic. The examples include arithmetic and logical operations, string manipulation, and collection processing. The paper concludes with a discussion of future work, including the extension of the mechanism to support user-defined control structures and the integration of the approach into other programming languages. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly enhance the productivity and clarity of software development, particularly for domain-specific applications that require customized operators and abstractions.","(329, 14)","User-defined syntax extensions are useful to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) with good  expressiveness and maintainability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to user-defined operators including name binding for new language constructs. Our goal is to provide a flexible and efficient way to extend the syntax of a programming language, allowing users to define their own operators and bind them to specific names.

To achieve this, we introduce a new construct called ""operator definition"" which allows users to define a new operator with a specific syntax and semantics. The operator definition consists of three parts: the operator name, the operator syntax, and the operator semantics. The operator name is used to bind the operator to a specific name in the language, while the operator syntax defines how the operator can be used in the language. The operator semantics defines the behavior of the operator when it is applied to a set of arguments.

Our approach is based on a modular design, where the operator definition is decoupled from the language implementation. This allows users to define new operators without modifying the language implementation, making it easier to extend the language. We also provide a set of built-in operators that can be used as a starting point for user-defined operators.

One of the key features of our approach is the use of name binding, which allows users to bind a new operator to an existing name in the language. This makes it easier for users to extend the language without introducing new keywords or syntax. For example, a user can define a new operator called ""+"" that behaves like the existing ""+"" operator, but with a different semantics. The user can then use the new ""+"" operator in their code, without having to modify the existing code that uses the original ""+"" operator.

A definition of quasi-flat left module is proposed and it is shown that any left ","A definition of quasi-flat left module is proposed and it is shown that any left module which is either quasi-projective or flat is quasi-flat. A characterization of local commutative rings for which each ideal is quasi-flat (resp. quasi-projective) is given. It is also proven that each commutative ring R whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat is of $\lambda$-dimension $\le$ 3, and this dimension $\le$ 2 if R is local. This extends a former result about the class of arithmetical rings. Moreover, if R has a unique minimal prime ideal then its finitely generated ideals are quasi-projective if they are quasi-flat. In [1] Abuhlail, Jarrar and Kabbaj studied the class of commutative fqp-rings (finitely generated ideals are quasi-projective). They proved that this class of rings strictly contains the one of arithmetical rings and is strictly contained in the one of Gaussian rings. It is also shown that the property for a commutative ring to be fqp is preserved by localization. It is known that a commutative ring R is arithmetical (resp. Gaussian) if and only if R M is arithmetical (resp. Gaussian) for each maximal ideal M of R. But an example given in [6] shows that a commutative ring which is a locally fqp-ring is not necessarily a fqp-ring. So, in this cited paper the class of fqf-rings is introduced. Each local commutative fqf-ring is a fqp-ring, and a commutative ring is fqf if and only if it is locally fqf. These fqf-rings are defined in [6] without a definition of quasi-flat modules. Here we propose a definition of these modules and another definition of fqf-ring which is equivalent to the one given in [6]. We also introduce the module property of self-flatness. Each quasi-flat module is self-flat but we do not know if the converse holds. On the other hand, each flat module is quasi-flat and any finitely generated module is quasi-flat if and only if it is flat modulo its annihilator. In Section 2 we give a complete characterization of local commutative rings for which each ideal is self-flat. These rings R are fqp and their nilradical N is the subset of zerodivisors of R. In the case where R is not a chain ring for which N = N 2 and R N is not coherent every ideal is flat modulo its annihilator. Then in Section 3 we deduce that any ideal of a chain ring (valuation ring) R is quasi-projective if and only if it is almost maximal and each zerodivisor is nilpotent. This complete the results obtained by Hermann in [11] on valuation domains. In Section 4 we show that each commutative fqf-ring is of $\lambda$-dimension $\le$ 3. This extends the result about arithmetical rings obtained in [4]. Moreover it is shown that this $\lambda$-dimension is $\le$ 2 in the local case. But an example of a local Gaussian ring R of $\lambda$-dimension $\ge$ 3 is given.","(559, 27)","Commutative rings whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat have received significant attention in the context of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

We explore the basic properties of such rings, and provide several equivalent characterizations of them. In particular, we show that a commutative ring R is such that all its finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat if and only if R satisfies certain coherence conditions.

We also investigate the relationship between these rings and various other classes of commutative rings, such as universally catenary rings and integral domains that admit a dualizing complex. We provide examples to illustrate that the class of commutative rings whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat is strictly larger than the class of universally catenary rings, and that not all such rings admit a dualizing complex.

Finally, we study the local cohomology of modules over commutative rings whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat. We prove that if R is such a ring and M is a finitely generated module over R, then the local cohomology of M with respect to an ideal I in R is finite-dimensional for any finitely generated ideal I in R. We also investigate the relationship between the finiteness of local cohomology and the Bass property for modules over commutative rings whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat.

Then we pass to higher order results, and in particulat to some specific BV and Sobolev estimates, where the JKO scheme together with the so-called ""five gradients inequality"" allows to recover some inequalities that can be deduced from the Bakry-Emery theory for diffusion operators, but also to obtain some novel ones, in particular for the Keller-Segel chemiotaxis model. 1 Short introduction The goal of this paper is to present some estimates on evolution PDEs in the space of probability densities which share two important features: they include a linear diffusion term, and they are gradient flows in the Wasserstein space W2. These PDEs will be of the form $\partial$t$\rho$ -- $\Delta$$\rho$ -- $\nabla$ $\times$ ($\rho$$\nabla$u[$\rho$]) = 0, complemented with no-flux boundary conditions and an intial condition on $\rho$0. We will in particular concentrate on the Fokker-Plack case, where u[$\rho$] = V and V is a fixed function (with possible regularity assumptions) independent of $\rho$, on the case where u[$\rho$] = W * $\rho$ is obtained by convolution and models interaction between particles, and on the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel case where u[$\rho$] is related to $\rho$ via an elliptic equation. This last case models the evolution of a biological population $\rho$ subject to diffusion but attracted by the concentration of a chemo-attractant, a nutrient which is produced by the population itself, so that its distribution is ruled by a PDE where the density $\rho$ appears as a source term. Under the assumption that the production rate of this nutrient is much faster than the motion of the cells, we can assume that its distribution is ruled by a statical PDE with no explicit time-dependence, and gives rise to a system which is a gradient flow in the variable $\rho$ (the parabolic-parabolic case, where the time scale for the cells and for the nutrient are comparable, is also a gradient flow, in the product space W2 x L 2 , but we will not consider this case). Since we mainly concentrate on the case of bounded domains, in the Keller-Segel case the term u[$\rho$] cannot be expressed as a convoluton and requires ad-hoc computations.

In all the paper, the estimates will be studied on a time-discretized version of these PDEs, consisting in the so-called JKO (Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto) scheme, based on iterated optimization problems involving the Wasserstein distance W2. We will first present 0-order estimates, on the L p and L $\infty$ norms of the solution. This is just a translation into the JKO language of well-known properties of these equations. The main goal of this part is hence to","(595, 13)","This research paper delves on the estimation of solutions of Fokker-Planck equations - a powerful mathematical tool that models diffusion phenomena. Our focus is on linear and non-linear Fokker-Planck equations, where we show the robustness of the JKO scheme. In particular, we extend estimates for JKO schemes in both the linear and non-linear cases and prove that they converge for the respective PDEs. Our results offer an innovative approach to tackle diffusion phenomena, and the linear/non-linear cases of Fokker-Planck equations are vital in various research applications.

Furthermore, we explore the application of these estimates to non-linear Keller-Segel models, which model chemotactic phenomena in biology. We study the dynamics of the concentration of cells in a both finite and infinite domain, while incorporating a particular chemotactic sensitivity function, where previously known estimates have failed. We demonstrate that the application of JKO schemes provides new and sharp Lp and Sobolev bounds which help to obtain better estimates in the chemotactic system. Our results are instrumental in unveiling critical dynamics of the chemotactic reaction-diffusion equations.

Our study explores various numerical experiments that provide evidence of the efficiency of our scheme. We demonstrate that the estimates provided by the JKO scheme in explicit numerical simulations match very closely the exact solutions of the PDEs. Our experiments support the conclusion that JKO estimates are reliable and offer valuable insights for the analysis of non-linear PDEs.

To conclude, our paper contributes to the understanding of diffusion phenomena and offers an innovative approach to estimate solutions of both linear and non-linear Fokker-Planck equations. Our method is also proven to be valuable in the application of Keller-Segel models, and we provide new results of Lp and Sobolev bounds that are imperative to better understand chemotactic phenomena. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach is reliable and effective in practice. This research may have significant practical applications in both biological and physical sciences.","(338, 15)","We analyze some parabolic PDEs with different drift terms which are gradient flows in the 2-Wasserstein metric. Our main goal is to derive JKO (Jordan, Kinderlehrer, Otto) estimates in both linear and nonlinear Fokker-Plank equations, as well as in the Keller-Segel model. These estimates are crucial for understanding the long-time behavior of solutions to these equations, particularly in the context of concentration phenomena.

In the linear case, we consider the equation $\partial_t \rho = \Delta \rho - \nabla \cdot (\rho \nabla V)$, where $\rho$ is the density and $V$ is a given potential. We use the JKO scheme to approximate the solution and derive a bound on the $L^p$ norm of the difference between the approximate and exact solutions. This bound is expressed in terms of the initial data, the potential $V$, and the time step used in the JKO scheme. We then show that this bound is sharp by providing a counterexample.

In the nonlinear case, we consider two types of nonlinearities: a logarithmic nonlinearity and a power-law nonlinearity. For the logarithmic case, we derive an $L^\infty$ bound on the solution, while for the power-law case, we obtain a bound in terms of the $L^q$ norm of the solution, where $q$ is related to the power-law exponent. These bounds are essential for understanding the behavior of solutions in the presence of nonlinear interactions.

We also investigate the Keller-Segell model, which describes the aggregation of self-attracting particles. This model is known to exhibit concentration phenomena, where the solution develops a Dirac delta function as $t \to \infty$. We derive an $L^1$ bound on the difference between the JKO approximation and the exact solution, which provides insight into the rate at which the solution converges to the Dirac delta function.

Our results have significant implications for the understanding of concentration phenomena in these models. The JKO estimates provide a quantitative measure of the rate at which solutions concentrate, which can be used to study the emergence of patterns and structures in these systems. Furthermore, our results can be used to develop more efficient numerical methods for solving these equations, as the JKO scheme can be used as a preconditioner for more traditional numerical methods.

The relation between Science (what we can explain) and Art (what we can't) has long ","The relation between Science (what we can explain) and Art (what we can't) has long been acknowledged and while every science contains an artistic part, every art form also needs a bit of science. Among all scientific disciplines, programming holds a special place for two reasons. First, the artistic part is not only undeniable but also essential. Second, and much like in a purely artistic discipline, the act of programming is driven partly by the notion of aesthetics: the pleasure we have in creating beautiful things. Even though the importance of aesthetics in the act of programming is now unquestioned, more could still be written on the subject. The field called ""psychology of programming"" focuses on the cognitive aspects of the activity, with the goal of improving the productivity of programmers. While many scientists have emphasized their concern for aesthetics and the impact it has on their activity, few computer scientists have actually written about their thought process while programming. What makes us like or dislike such and such language or paradigm? Why do we shape our programs the way we do? By answering these questions from the angle of aesthetics, we may be able to shed some new light on the art of programming. Starting from the assumption that aesthetics is an inherently transversal dimension, it should be possible for every programmer to find the same aesthetic driving force in every creative activity they undertake, not just programming, and in doing so, get deeper insight on why and how they do things the way they do. On the other hand, because our aesthetic sensitivities are so personal, all we can really do is relate our own experiences and share it with others, in the hope that it will inspire them to do the same. My personal life has been revolving around three major creative activities, of equal importance: programming in Lisp, playing Jazz music, and practicing Aikido. But why so many of them, why so different ones, and why these specifically? By introspecting my personal aesthetic sensitivities, I eventually realized that my tastes in the scientific, artistic, and physical domains are all motivated by the same driving forces, hence unifying Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido as three expressions of a single essence, not so different after all. Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are governed by a limited set of rules which remain simple and unobtrusive. Conforming to them is a pleasure. Because Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are inherently introspective disciplines, they also invite you to transgress the rules in order to find your own. Breaking the rules is fun.

Finally, if Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido unify so many paradigms, styles, or techniques, it is not by mere accumulation but because they live at the meta-level and let you reinvent them. Working at the meta-level is an enlightening experience. Understand your aesthetic sensitivities and you may gain considerable insight on your own psychology of programming. Mine is perhaps common to most lispers. Perhaps also common to other programming communities, but that, is for the reader to decide...","(579, 24)","This paper seeks to explore the intersections between the seemingly disparate fields of Lisp programming, jazz music, and the martial art of Aikido, ultimately arguing that they each express a fundamental and interconnected aspect of the human experience. This argument is based on a thorough and multifaceted analysis of each field, drawing on a range of theoretical and practical perspectives.

In the case of Lisp programming, this paper contends that the language's unique focus on recursion and abstraction reflects a deeply ingrained human tendency to seek out patterns and create mental models of the world around us. Drawing on both historical and contemporary examples, the paper demonstrates how Lisp has been used to solve complex computational problems and push the boundaries of artificial intelligence research.

Similarly, the paper argues that jazz music represents a powerful means of embodying and exploring the complex interplay between structure and improvisation. By examining the techniques and philosophies of jazz musicians such as John Coltrane and Miles Davis, the paper shows how the genre's emphasis on creative collaboration and spontaneous innovation can help us to better understand the dynamics of social interaction and teamwork.

Finally, the paper turns to the martial art of Aikido, which it argues provides a profound physical and philosophical framework for exploring the fundamental nature of conflict and harmony. By drawing on insights from both traditional Japanese knowledge and contemporary psychology research, the paper demonstrates how Aikido can illuminate important aspects of human relationships and allow us to develop more effective strategies for resolving conflicts.

Taken together, these three distinct fields of inquiry represent different expressions of a single underlying essence or principle, which can be understood through an integration of theory and practice across multiple domains. The paper concludes by exploring some of the broader implications of this argument for fields such as education, psychology, and philosophy, suggesting that a deeper appreciation of the interconnections between seemingly disparate disciplines is essential for addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today.","(360, 10)","The relation between Science (what we can explain) and Art (what we can't) has long  been a subject of debate among scholars.

Through an in-depth analysis of these disciplines, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and principles that unite them, shedding new light on the nature of creativity, innovation, and human expression.

Our research methodology involves a multi-disciplinary approach, combining elements of computer science, music theory, and martial arts philosophy. We begin by examining the fundamental principles of Lisp, a programming language renowned for its elegance and simplicity. We analyze the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of Lisp, highlighting its unique features such as prefix notation, recursion, and functional programming. By doing so, we reveal the underlying logic and structure that underlies Lisp's expressive power.

We delve into the theoretical foundations of Jazz, exploring the role of harmony, melody, and rhythm in shaping the musical experience. We also examine the lives and works of influential Jazz musicians, such as Louis Armstrong and John Coltrane, to gain insight into the creative processes that drive artistic innovation.

Finally, we explore the principles of Aikido, a martial art that emphasizes harmonizing with one's opponent rather than opposing them. We examine the philosophical underpinnings of Aikiroshi Ueshiba's teachings, highlighting the importance of balance, centering, and fluid movement. By analyzing the techniques and strategies employed in Aikido, we reveal the subtle yet powerful connections between physical movement, mental focus, and spiritual awareness.

In two articles ([Brisson-Ofman1, 2]), we have analyzed the so-called 'mathematical passage' of Plato's Theaetetus, ","In two articles ([Brisson-Ofman1, 2]), we have analyzed the so-called 'mathematical passage' of Plato's Theaetetus, the first dialogue of a trilogy including the Sophist and the Statesman. In the present article, we study an important point in more detail, the 'definition' of 'powers' ('$\delta\upsilon\nu\acute\alpha\mu\epsilon\iota\varsigma$'). While in [Brisson-Ofman2], it was shown that the different steps to get the definition are mathematically and philosophically incorrect, it is explained why the definition itself is problematic. However, it is the first example, at least in the trilogy, of a definition by division. This point is generally ignored by modern commentators though, as we will try to show, it gives rise, in a mathematical context, to at least three fundamental questions: the meaning(s) of 'logos', the connection between 'elements and compound' and, of course the question of the 'power(s)'. One of the main consequences of our works on Theaetetus' 'mathematical passage', including the present one, is to challenge the so-called 'main standard interpretation'. In particular, following [Ofman2014], we question the claim that Plato praises and glorifies both the mathematician Theodorus and the young Theaetetus. According to our analysis, such a claim, considered as self-evident, entails many errors. Conversely, our analysis of Theaetetus' mathematical mistakes highlights the main cause of some generally overlooked failures in the dialogue: the forgetting of the 'logos', first in the 'mathematical part', then in the following discussion, and finally the failure of the four successive tries of its definition at the end of the dialogue. Namely, as we will show, the passage is closely connected with the problems studied at the end of the dialogue, but also to the two other parts of the trilogy through the method of 'definition by division'. Finally, if our conclusions are different from the usual ones, it is probably because the passage is analyzed, maybe for the first time, simultaneously from the philosophical, historical and mathematical points of view. It had been considered usually either as an excursus by historians of philosophy (for instance [Burnyeat1978]), or as an isolated text separated from the rest of the dialogue by historians of mathematics (for instance [Knorr1975]), or lastly as a pretext to discuss some astute developments in modern mathematics by mathematicians (for instance [Kahane1985]).[Brisson-Ofman1]: Luc Brisson-Salomon Ofman, `Theodorus' lesson in Plato's Theaetetus(147d3-d6) Revisited-A New Perspective', to appear[Brisson-Ofman2]: Luc Brisson-Salomon Ofman, `The Philosophical Interpretation of Plato'sTheaetetus and the Final Part of the Mathematical Lesson (147d7-148b)', to appear[Burnyeat 1978]: Myles Burnyeat, `The Philosophical Sense of Theaetetus' Mathematics',Isis, 69, 1978, 489-514[Kahane1985]: Jean-Pierre Kahane, `la th{\'e}orie de Th{\'e}odore des corps quadratiques r{\'e}els',L'enseignement math{\'e}matique, 31, 1985, p.

70-80","(663, 13)","This academic paper explores the concept of powers and division in the ""mathematical part"" of Plato's Theaetetus. The work analyzes the dialogue between Socrates and Theaetetus as they delve into the intricacies of mathematical knowledge, particularly the relationship between powers and roots and the concept of division. The paper situates the dialogue within the larger context of Plato's philosophy, including his views on the nature of knowledge and the role of mathematics in understanding the world. 

The first section of the paper provides an overview of the mathematical concepts discussed in the dialogue, including the identification of perfect squares and the calculation of powers. The authors analyze the initial definition of a power, which is presented in terms of repeated multiplication, and examine the relationship between powers and roots. They also discuss the concept of division in relation to powers, exploring the role of ratios and proportionality in mathematical calculations.

The second section of the paper situates the dialogue within a broader philosophical framework. The authors draw on Plato's views of knowledge and epistemology, particularly his belief in the existence of objective, eternal forms or ideas. They argue that the mathematical concepts explored in the dialogue can be seen as a reflection of these higher forms, and that the act of understanding mathematics involves a process of recollection and discovery. 

The final section of the paper considers the implications of the discussion for contemporary philosophy and mathematics. The authors argue that the problems and concepts explored in the dialogue remain relevant today, particularly in the fields of algebra, geometry, and number theory. They suggest that the dialogue can be seen as a precursor to modern mathematical thinking, with its emphasis on abstraction, generalization, and proof. 

Overall, this paper offers a detailed examination of the role of powers and division in the ""mathematical part"" of Plato's Theaetetus. Through close analysis of the dialogue between Socrates and Theaetetus, the paper explores the intricate relationships between different mathematical concepts and situates them within the larger context of Plato's philosophy. The authors suggest that the dialogue remains a rich source of insight and inspiration for contemporary philosophers and mathematicians alike, and that its enduring relevance speaks to the continued importance of mathematical thinking in understanding the world around us.","(417, 15)","In two articles ([Brisson-Ofman1, 2]), we have analyzed the so-called'mathematical passage' of Plato's Theaetetus, 147e-148c, which deals with powers and division. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of this passage, focusing on the mathematical concepts presented and their philosophical implications.

Our research question is: How does Plato use mathematical concepts, specifically powers and division, to explore the nature of knowledge and reality in the Theaetetus?

To address this question, we employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining mathematical, philosophical, and historical analysis. We began by examining the mathematical content of the passage, identifying the specific concepts of powers and division that Plato employs. We then analyzed the philosophical context in which these mathematical concepts are presented, considering the broader themes of the dialogue, such as the nature of knowledge, reality, and the relationship between mathematics and philosophy.

Our methodology involved a close reading of the passage, supplemented by historical and mathematical research. We consulted primary sources, including Plato's other dialogues and the works of his contemporaries, to gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical and philosophical context in which the passage was written. We also engaged with secondary literature, including commentaries and scholarly articles, to situate our analysis within the broader field of Platonic studies.

One of the key findings of our research is that Plato uses powers and division to explore the concept of unity and multiplicity. In the passage, Plato argues that numbers can be divided into their constituent parts, but that these parts can also be recombined to form new numbers. This process of division and recombination is seen as a fundamental aspect of mathematical reasoning, and is used by Plato to illustrate the idea that knowledge is not a fixed or static entity, but rather a dynamic and ever-changing process.

Furthermore, our analysis reveals that Plato's use of powers and division is closely tied to his philosophical views on the nature of reality. Plato argues that the world we experience through our senses is mere appearance, and that true reality lies in the realm of abstract Forms or Ideas. The mathematical concepts presented in the passage are seen as a way of accessing this higher realm, and of understanding the underlying structure of reality.

Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of Plato's philosophy and its relationship to mathematics. They suggest that Plato saw mathematics as a powerful tool for exploring the nature of reality, and that he believed that mathematical concepts could be used to gain insight into the underlying structure of the world. This challenges the traditional view of Plato as a philosopher who was primarily concerned with metaphysics and epistemology, and highlights the importance of mathematics in his philosophical system.

In addition, our research","(514, 19)","In two articles ([Brisson-Ofman1, 2]), we have analyzed the so-called 'mathematical passage' of Plato's Theaetetus, [Theaetetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%E2%80%93Plato%27s_theaetetus) (c. 360 BC).
In the first article, we have shown that the mathematical passage is not a mathematical proof.
In the second, we have argued that it is not a definition.
In this paper, we will argue that it is neither a proof nor a definition, but rather an example.
We will show that it is an example of 'division in the mathematical part'.
We will also show that this example is not a proof, but rather a counterexample to the claim that 'division is not a part of mathematics'.

[brisson-ofmantwo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05989)","(186, 9)","In two articles ([Brisson-Ofman1, 2]), we have analyzed the so-called'mathematical passage' of Plato's Theaetetus, 147e-148c, which deals with powers and division. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of this passage, focusing on the mathematical concepts presented and their philosophical implications.

Our research question is: How does Plato use mathematical concepts, specifically powers and division, to explore the nature of knowledge and reality in the Theaetetus?

To address this question, we employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining mathematical, philosophical, and historical analysis. We began by examining the mathematical content of the passage, identifying the specific concepts of powers and division that Plato employs. We then analyzed the philosophical context in which these mathematical concepts are presented, considering the broader themes of the dialogue, such as the nature of knowledge, reality, and the relationship between mathematics and philosophy.

Our methodology involved a close reading of the passage, supplemented by historical and mathematical research. We consulted primary sources, including Plato's other dialogues and the works of his contemporaries, to gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical and philosophical context in which the passage was written. We also engaged with secondary literature, including commentaries and scholarly articles, to situate our analysis within the broader field of Platonic studies.

One of the key findings of our research is that Plato uses powers and division to explore the concept of unity and multiplicity. In the passage, Plato argues that numbers can be divided into their constituent parts, but that these parts can also be recombined to form new numbers. This process of division and recombination is seen as a fundamental aspect of mathematical reasoning, and is used by Plato to illustrate the idea that knowledge is not a fixed or static entity, but rather a dynamic and ever-changing process.

Furthermore, our analysis reveals that Plato's use of powers and division is closely tied to his philosophical views on the nature of reality. Plato argues that the world we experience through our senses is mere appearance, and that true reality lies in the realm of abstract Forms or Ideas. The mathematical concepts presented in the passage are seen as a way of accessing this higher realm, and of understanding the underlying structure of reality.

Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of Plato's philosophy and its relationship to mathematics. They suggest that Plato saw mathematics as a powerful tool for exploring the nature of reality, and that he believed that mathematical concepts could be used to gain insight into the underlying structure of the world. This challenges the traditional view of Plato as a philosopher who was primarily concerned with metaphysics and epistemology, and highlights the importance of mathematics in his philosophical system.

In addition, our research","In two articles ([Brisson-Ofman1, 2]), we have analyzed the so-called 'mathematical passage' of Plato's Theaetetus, [Theaetetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%E2%80%93Plato%27s_theaetetus) (c. 360 BC).
In the first article, we have shown that the mathematical passage is not a mathematical proof.
In the second, we have argued that it is not a definition.
In this paper, we will argue that it is neither a proof nor a definition, but rather an example.
We will show that it is an example of 'division in the mathematical part'.
We will also show that this example is not a proof, but rather a counterexample to the claim that 'division is not a part of mathematics'.

In this paper, we consider two cases of rolling of one smooth connected complete Riemannian ","In this paper, we consider two cases of rolling of one smooth connected complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ onto another one $(\hM,\hg)$ of equal dimension $n\geq 2$. The rolling problem $(NS)$ corresponds to the situation where there is no relative spin (or twist) of one manifold with respect to the other one. As for the rolling problem $(R)$, there is no relative spin and also no relative slip. Since the manifolds are not assumed to be embedded into an Euclidean space, we provide an intrinsic description of the two constraints ""without spinning"" and ""without slipping"" in terms of the Levi-Civita connections $\nabla^{g}$ and $\nabla^{\hg}$. For that purpose, we recast the two rolling problems within the framework of geometric control and associate to each of them a distribution and a control system. We then investigate the relationships between the two control systems and we address for both of them the issue of complete controllability. For the rolling $(NS)$, the reachable set (from any point) can be described exactly in terms of the holonomy groups of $(M,g)$ and $(\hM,\hg)$ respectively, and thus we achieve a complete understanding of the controllability properties of the corresponding control system. As for the rolling $(R)$, the problem turns out to be more delicate. We first provide basic global properties for the reachable set and investigate the associated Lie bracket structure. In particular, we point out the role played by a curvature tensor defined on the state space, that we call the \emph{rolling curvature}. In the case where one of the manifolds is a space form (let say $(\hM,\hg)$), we show that it is enough to roll along loops of $(M,g)$ and the resulting orbits carry a structure of principal bundle which preserves the rolling $(R)$ distribution. In the zero curvature case, we deduce that the rolling $(R)$ is completely controllable if and only if the holonomy group of $(M,g)$ is equal to SO(n). In the nonzero curvature case, we prove that the structure group of the principal bundle can be realized as the holonomy group of a connection on $TM\oplus \R$, that we call the rolling connection. We also show, in the case of positive (constant) curvature, that if the rolling connection is reducible, then $(M,g)$ admits, as Riemannian covering, the unit sphere with the metric induced from the Euclidean metric of $\R^{n+1}$. When the two manifolds are three-dimensional, we provide a complete local characterization of the reachable sets when the two manifolds are three-dimensional and, in particular, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a non open orbit. Besides the trivial case where the manifolds $(M,g)$ and $(\hM,\hg)$ are (locally) isometric, we show that (local) non controllability occurs if and only if $(M,g)$ and $(\hM,\hg)$ are either warped products or contact manifolds with additional restrictions that we precisely describe. Finally, we extend the two types of rolling to the case where the manifolds have different dimensions.","(660, 17)","The study of rolling manifolds, a type of manifold that is defined by its ability to roll without slipping, has received significant attention in recent years within the field of control theory. In this paper, we present an intrinsic formulation of rolling manifolds that considers their geometric and topological properties and explores the underlying mathematical structures that govern their behavior. 

Specifically, we use the theory of principal bundles to define a natural frame bundle for rolling manifolds, which allows us to express their dynamics in a coordinate-free way. This approach not only simplifies the analysis of rolling manifolds but also reveals essential features of their geometry, such as the existence of a connection on the frame bundle that characterizes the rolling motion.

We also investigate the controllability of rolling manifolds, which refers to the ability to reach any desired state in a finite amount of time by applying appropriate controls. Our results indicate that rolling manifolds are controllable for a large class of distributions on their tangent bundles, including those that correspond to regular and singular points. Moreover, we show that the notion of accessibility, i.e., the ability to reach any point in the configuration space, can be translated to a geometric condition on the curvature of the connection associated with the rolling motion.

To illustrate the applicability of our results, we provide several examples of rolling manifolds, including spheres, cylinders, and tori, and discuss their controllability properties in detail. In particular, we show how the curvature of the connection affects the motion of rolling manifolds and how this can be exploited to design optimal control strategies.

Finally, we discuss some open problems and future directions in the study of rolling manifolds. For instance, we highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between the geometric and dynamic properties of rolling manifolds and the role they play in the design of intelligent robotic systems. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive and rigorous treatment of rolling manifolds, which sheds light on their intrinsic formulation and controllability properties and paves the way for further research in this exciting area of control theory.","(383, 12)","In this paper, we consider two cases of rolling of one smooth connected complete Riemannian 3-manifold over another, which we refer to as the base manifold and the rolling manifold, respectively. Our goal is to provide an intrinsic formulation of rolling manifolds and investigate their controllability properties. Specifically, we aim to answer the following questions: What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a rolling manifold to be controllable? How does the geometry of the base manifold affect the controllability of the rolling manifold?

To address these questions, we employ a combination of differential geometry and control theory techniques. We begin by introducing the concept of a rolling manifold, which is defined as a smooth map between two Riemannian manifolds that preserves the metric tensor. We then derive the equations of motion for the rolling manifold using the Euler-Lagrange equations and the Noether's theorem. These equations describe the dynamics of the rolling manifold in terms of the velocities and accelerations of the base manifold.

Next, we investigate the controllability properties of the rolling manifold. We define controllability as the ability to steer the rolling manifold from any initial configuration to any final configuration in a finite amount of time. We use the concept of accessibility, which is a necessary condition for controllability, to derive a set of sufficient conditions for controllability. Specifically, we show that the rolling manifold is controllable if and only if the Lie algebra generated by the vector fields corresponding to the velocities of the base manifold spans the tangent space of the rolling manifold at every point.

We then proceed to analyze the effect of the base manifold geometry on controllability. We consider two types of base manifolds: compact and non-compact. For compact base manifolds, we show that controllability is guaranteed if the base manifold has a non-trivial fundamental group. This result is obtained by constructing a specific control input that steers the rolling manifold around a non-contractible loop on the base manifold. For non-compact base manifols, we demonstrate that controllability can fail even if the base manifold is simply connected. This is achieved by constructing a counterexample where the rolling manifold is not controllable due to the presence of a ""dead-end"" region on the base manifold.

Our findings have significant implications for various fields, including robotics, computer vision, and materials science.

Context. Refining or altering existing behavior is the daily work of every developer, but that ","Context. Refining or altering existing behavior is the daily work of every developer, but that cannot be always anticipated, and software sometimes cannot be stopped. In such cases, unanticipated adaptation of running systems is of interest for many scenarios, ranging from functional upgrades to on-the-fly debugging or monitoring of critical applications.

Inquiry. A way of altering software at run time is using behavioral reflection, which is particularly well-suited for unanticipated adaptation of real-world systems. Partial behavioral reflection is not a new idea, and for years many efforts have been made to propose a practical way of expressing it.

All these efforts resulted in practical solutions, but which introduced a semantic gap between the code that requires adaptation and the expression of the partial behavior. For example, in Aspect-Oriented Programming, a pointcut description is expressed in another language, which introduces a new distance between the behavior expression (the Advice) and the source code in itself.

Approach. Ten years ago, the idea of closing the gap between the code and the expression of the partial behavior led to the implementation of the Reflectivity framework. Using Reflectivity, developers annotate Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes with meta-behavior which is taken into account by the compiler to produce behavioral variations. In this paper, we present Reflectivity, its API, its implementation and its usage in Pharo. We reflect on ten years of use of Reflectivity, and show how it has been used as a basic building block of many innovative ideas.

Knowledge. Reflectivity brings a practical way of working at the AST level, which is a high-level representation of the source code manipulated by software developers. It enables a powerful way of dynamically add and modify behavior.

Reflectivity is also a flexible mean to bridge the gap between the expression of the meta-behavior and the source code. This ability to apply unanticipated adaptation and to provide behavioral reflection led to many experiments and projects during this last decade by external users. Existing work use Reflectivity to implement reflective libraries or languages extensions, featherweight code instrumentation, dynamic software update, debugging tools and visualization and software analysis tools.

Grounding. Reflectivity is actively used in research projects. During the past ten years, it served as a support, either for implementation or as a fundamental base, for many research work including PhD theses, conference, journal and workshop papers. Reflectivity is now an important library of the Pharo language, and is integrated at the heart of the platform.

Importance. Reflectivity exposes powerful abstractions to deal with partial behavioral adaptation, while providing a mature framework for unanticipated, non-intrusive and partial behavioral reflection based on AST annotation.

Furthermore, even if Reflectivity found its home inside Pharo, it is not a pure Smalltalk-oriented solution. As validation over the practical use of Reflectivity in dynamic object-oriented languages, the API has been ported to Python. Finally, the AST annotation feature of Reflectivity opens new experimentation opportunities about the control that developers could gain on the behavior of their own software.","(560, 28)","In this paper, we provide a retrospective look at our use of the sub-method of partial behavioral reflection in conjunction with Reflectivity over the past decade. Our analysis focuses on a variety of aspects, including the practical benefits of the approach, its effectiveness in improving system design, and its potential for future research.

Overall, our experience with this combination of techniques has been highly positive. Through the use of partial behavioral reflection, we have been able to gain valuable insights into the behavior of complex systems, allowing us to identify and address design flaws and other issues that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. Meanwhile, Reflectivity has provided a flexible and powerful foundation for implementing these techniques, allowing us to customize our approach to suit the specific needs of each project.

One particularly notable area of success has been in the realm of software design. Through our use of partial behavioral reflection, we have been able to analyze user interactions with complex software systems, identifying areas of inefficiency, confusion, or error. By using the information gleaned from these analyses, we have been able to improve the design of these systems, resulting in a more intuitive and effective user experience.

However, we also identify areas for improvement in our approach. One significant challenge we have encountered is the difficulty of handling large volumes of data resulting from partial behavioral reflection. Given the sheer amount of information generated by this technique, it can be overwhelming to sort through and make sense of all the data. Similarly, we note that the use of partial behavioral reflection can sometimes result in a lack of context, making it difficult to fully understand the significance of certain observed behaviors.

Despite these limitations, we remain optimistic about the potential for partial behavioral reflection and Reflectivity to continue to drive significant innovation in the field of system design and analysis. Moving forward, we believe that there is room for further optimization of these techniques, as well as for continued exploration of their potential in new and different contexts.

Overall, our experience with partial behavioral reflection and Reflectivity has been highly positive, allowing us to gain important insights into system behavior, improve design, and drive innovation in the field. While challenges remain, we believe that these techniques hold great promise for future research, and we look forward to continuing to explore their potential in the years to come.","(442, 16)","Context. Refining or altering existing behavior is the daily work of every developer, but that 20% of the code is responsible for 80% of the bugs is a well-known fact in the field of software engineering.

PBR is a technique that allows developers to inspect and modify the behavior of specific parts of their codebase without affecting the rest of the system. In this paper, we reflect on the development and application of Reflectivity, a sub-method of PBR that we have been using for the past 10 years.

Research Question. The primary research question guiding this study is: What are the benefits and limitations of using Reflectivity for partial behavioral reflection in software development, and how has its use evolved over the past decade? To answer this question, we conducted a mixed-methods study combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods.

Methodology. Our study consisted of two main components: a systematic review of existing literature on PBR and Reflectivity, and a survey of developers who have used Reflectivity in their projects. The literature review aimed to identify the key features and applications of Reflectivity, as well as its strengths and weaknesses. The survey, on the other hand, sought to gather information on the practical experiences of developers who have employed Reflectivity in their work.

Findings. Our literature review revealed that Reflectivity has been successfully applied in a variety of domains, including web development, mobile app development, and enterprise software development.

Implications. The findings of our study have several implications for software development practice and research. Firstly, our results suggest that Reflectivity can be a valuable tool for improving code quality and reducing debugging time, particularly in large and complex software systems.

Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) processing of EV 31 magnesium alloy has been carried out in ","Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) processing of EV 31 magnesium alloy has been carried out in fluoride containing electrolyte under bipolar pulse current regime. Unusual PEO cathodic micro-discharges have been observed and investigated. It is shown that the cathodic micro-discharges exhibit a collective intermittent behavior which is discussed in terms of charge accumulations at the layer/electrolyte and layer/metal interfaces. Optical emission spectroscopy is used to determine the electron density (typ. 10 15 cm-3) and the electron temperature (typ. 7500 K) while the role of F-anions on the appearance of cathodic micro-discharges is pointed out. Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) is a promising plasma-assisted surface treatment of light metallic alloys (e.g. Al, Mg, Ti). Although the PEO process makes it possible to grow oxide coatings with interesting corrosion and wear resistant properties, the physical mechanisms of coating growth are not yet completely understood. Typically, the process consists in applying a high voltage difference between a metallic piece and a counter-electrode which are both immersed in an electrolyte bath. Compare to anodizing, the main differences concern the electrolyte composition and the current and voltage ranges which are at least one order of magnitude higher in PEO 1. These significant differences in current and voltage imply the dielectric breakdown and consequently the appearance of micro-discharges on the surface of the sample under processing. Those micro-discharges are recognized as being the main contributors to the formation of a dielectric porous crystalline oxide coating.

2 Nevertheless, the breakdown mechanism that governs the appearance of those micro-discharges is still under investigation. Hussein et al. 3 proposed a mechanism with three different plasma formation processes based on differences in plasma chemical composition. The results of Jovovi{\'c} et al. 4,5 concerning physical properties of the plasma seem to corroborate this mechanism, and also point out the importance of the substrate material in the plasma composition. 6 Compared with DC conducted PEO process, using a bipolar pulsed DC or AC current supply gives supplementary control latitude through the current waveform parameters. The effect of these parameter on the micro-discharges behavior has been investigated in several previous works.

2,3,7,8 One of the main results of these studies is the absence of micro-discharge during the cathodic current half-period. 9-11 Even if the cathodic half-period has an obvious effect on the efficiency of PEO as well as on the coating growth and composition, the micro-plasmas appear only in anodic half-period. Sah et al. 8 have observed the cathodic breakdown of an oxide layer but at very high current density (10 kA.dm-${}^2$), and after several steps of sample preparation. Several models of micro-discharges appearance in AC current have already been proposed. 1,2,8,12,13 Though cathodic micro-discharges have never been observed within usual process conditions, the present study aims at defining suitable conditions to promote cathodic micro-discharges and at studying the main characteristics of these micro-plasmas.","(528, 26)","The plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process has been widely researched for its ability to enhance the corrosion resistance and surface hardness of materials. In this study, we investigate the evidence of cathodic micro-discharges during the PEO process.

To examine the occurrence of micro-discharges, a series of experiments were conducted using aluminum alloy substrates immersed in an electrolyte solution. The samples were subjected to a range of voltage pulses with varying frequencies and durations. The resulting behavior of the discharges was monitored using high-speed imaging and optical emission spectroscopy.

Our findings indicate that cathodic micro-discharges were detected during the PEO process. These discharges occurred on both the surface and within the electrolyte solution. The discharges were characterized by high-intensity flashes lasting between 1 and 10 microseconds, and were accompanied by significant changes in optical emissions.

The observed behavior of the discharges strongly suggests that they play a significant role in the PEO process. It is proposed that these micro-discharges contribute to the structuring and hardening of the oxide layer formed on the surface by enhancing the surface energy and reactivity. Furthermore, the discharges are thought to facilitate the incorporation of foreign particles into the oxide layer, further improving its properties.

To further investigate the nature of these micro-discharges, we conducted numerical simulations using a hybrid model combining fluid dynamics, electrodynamics, and surface chemistry. The model was able to reproduce the observed behavior of the discharges and provided additional insights into their underlying mechanisms.

Overall, our study provides compelling evidence for the presence and significance of cathodic micro-discharges during the PEO process. This knowledge can be applied to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the process for a variety of engineering applications. In future research, it would be interesting to investigate the impact of different parameters, such as voltage and electrolyte composition, on the behavior of these discharges.","(336, 16)","Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) processing of EV 31 magnesium alloy has been carried out in 0.1 M sodium nitrate aqueous solution using a DC power supply. This study aims to investigate the occurrence of cathodic micro-discharges during the PEO process and their effects on the surface morphology and composition of the formed oxide layer.

The PEO process was conducted at a constant current density of 100 mA/cm² for 30 minutes. The electrolyte temperature was maintained at 25°C ± 1°C throughout the experiment. A platinum electrode was used as the counter electrode, and the distance between the working electrode and the counter electrode was kept at 5 cm. The PEO process was monitored using a high-speed camera at a frame rate of 1000 frames per second. The camera was positioned at an angle of 45° relative to the working electrode to capture the micro-discharges.

During the PEO process, micro-discharges were observed on the surface of the working electrode. These micro-discharges were characterized by bright flashes of light, which were recorded by the high-speed camera.

Developers need to make a constant effort to improve the quality of their code if ","Developers need to make a constant effort to improve the quality of their code if they want to stay productive. Tools that highlight code locations that could benefit from refactoring are thus highly desirable. The most common name for such locations is ""bad code smell"". A number of tools offer such quality feedback and there is a substantial body of related research. However, all these tools, including those based on Machine Learning, still produce false positives. Every single false positive shown to the developer places a cognitive burden on her and should thus be avoided. The literature discusses the choice of metric thresholds, the general subjectivity of such a judgment and the relation to conscious design choices, ""design ideas"". To examine false positives and the relation between bad smells and design ideas, we designed and conducted an exploratory case study. While previous research presented a broad overview, we have chosen a narrow setting to reach for even deeper insights: The framework JHotDraw had been designed so thoughtfully that most smell warnings are expected to be false positives. Nevertheless, the ""Law of Good Style"", better known as the ""Law of Demeter"", is a rather restrictive design rule so that we still expected to find some potential bad smells, i.e.

violations of this ""Law"". This combination led to 1215 potential smells of which at most 42 are true positives. We found generic as well as specific design ideas that were traded for the smell. Our confidence in that decision ranged from high enough to very high. We were surprised to realize that the smell definition itself required the formulation of constructive design ideas.

Finally we found some smells to be the result of the limitation of the language and one could introduce auxiliary constructive design ideas to compensate for them. The decision whether a potential smell occurrence is actually a true positive was made very meticulously. For that purpose we took three qualities that the smell could affect negatively into account and we discussed the result of the recommended refactorings. If we were convinced that we had found a false positive, we described the relationships with design ideas. The realization that not only general design ideas but also specific design ideas have an influence on whether a potential smell is a true positive turns the problem of false positives from a scientific problem (""What is the true definition of the smell?"") to a engineering problem (""How can we incorporate design ideas into smell definitions?""). We recommend to add adaptation points to the smell definitions. Higher layers may then adapt the smell for specific contexts.

After adaptation the tool may continuously provide distinct and precise quality feedback, reducing the cognitive load for the developer and preventing habituation. Furthermore, the schema for the discussion of potential smells may be used to elaborate more sets of true and false smell occurrences. Finally, it follows that smell detection based on machine learning should also take signs of design ideas into account.","(556, 26)","This research paper explores the extent to which JHotDraw, a popular drawing application framework, conforms to the principles of good coding style. We investigate whether instances of reported bad code smells - indicators of poor quality code - are in fact false positives or genuine issues. Our study constitutes a deep dive into the nature of these false positives.

First, we provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant literature, including previous studies and best practices in coding. We then present the methodology used in our investigation, highlighting the criteria for identifying bad code smells and selecting relevant metrics for analysis.

Our results suggest that while JHotDraw generally adheres to good coding practices, there are instances of false positives related to certain types of bad code smells. In particular, we found that code smells related to duplication, complexity, and unused code were more likely to be false positives than others. This finding has important implications for developers who use automated code analysis tools, as false positives can waste time and resources and detract from genuine issues.

Furthermore, we offer insights into the reasons behind these false positives. We find that the use of design patterns and certain coding conventions in JHotDraw can sometimes create false positives for certain bad code smells. These findings are relevant not only for JHotDraw developers but also for other developers who may encounter similar challenges.

Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the broader software development community. We argue that automated code analysis tools need to consider context-specific factors when detecting bad code smells and that developers need to exercise caution when interpreting the results of such tools. Our study highlights the need for continued research into the nature of false positives in automated code analysis and for the development of improved tools and techniques for identifying genuine issues.

In this paper, we investigate whether JHotDraw, a popular Java-based drawing tool, respects the law of good style, which states that good code should be easy to understand, modify, and extend.

To answer this question, we employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative methods. First, we conducted a static analysis of the JHotDraw codebase using the SonarQube tool, which provided us with a list of bad code smells detected in the code. We then manually inspected the code to verify the accuracy of the detected smells and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying design issues. Additionally, we conducted a survey among JHotDraw developers to gather information about their coding practices and experiences with the tool.

Our results show that JHotDraw contains a significant number of bad code smells, including long methods, duplicated code, and complex conditional statements. However, upon closer inspection, we found that many of these smells were false positives, meaning that they were not actually indicative of deeper design problems. For example, some methods were long because they performed multiple related tasks, rather than being overly complex. Similarly, duplicated code was often due to the use of copy-paste programming, rather than a lack of abstraction.

Our findings have several implications for the development of JHotDraw and other software systems. First, they highlight the need for more accurate detection of bad code smells.

In the study of Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles, it is natural to perturb Hamiltoni-ans ","In the study of Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles, it is natural to perturb Hamiltoni-ans by adding potentials (functions depending only on the base point). This led to the definition of Ma{\~n}{\'e} genericity: a property is generic if, given a Hamiltonian H, the set of potentials u such that H + u satisfies the property is generic. This notion is mostly used in the context of Hamiltonians which are convex in p, in the sense that $\partial$ 2 pp H is positive definite at each points. We will also restrict our study to this situation. There is a close relation between perturbations of Hamiltonians by a small additive potential and perturbations by a positive factor close to one.

Indeed, the Hamiltonians H + u and H/(1 -- u) have the same level one energy surface, hence their dynamics on this energy surface are reparametrisation of each other, this is the Maupertuis principle. This remark is particularly relevant when H is homogeneous in the fibers (which corresponds to Finsler metrics) or even fiberwise quadratic (which corresponds to Riemannian metrics).

In these cases, perturbations by potentials of the Hamiltonian correspond, up to parametrisation, to conformal perturbations of the metric. One of the widely studied aspects is to understand to what extent the return map associated to a periodic orbit can be perturbed by adding a small potential. This kind of question depend strongly on the context in which they are posed. Some of the most studied contexts are, in increasing order of difficulty, perturbations of general vector fields, perturbations of Hamiltonian systems inside the class of Hamiltonian systems, perturbations of Riemannian metrics inside the class of Riemannian metrics, Ma{\~n}{\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians. It is for example well-known that each vector field can be perturbed to a vector field with only hyperbolic periodic orbits, this is part of the Kupka-Smale theorem, see [5, 13]. There is no such result in the context of Hamiltonian vector fields, but it remains true that each Hamiltonian can be perturbed to a Hamiltonian with only non-degenerate periodic orbits (including the iterated ones), see [11, 12]. The same result is true in the context of Riemannian metrics: every Riemannian metric can be perturbed to a Riemannian metric with only non-degenerate closed geodesics, this is the bumpy metric theorem, see [4, 2, 1]. The question was investigated only much more recently in the context of Ma{\~n}{\'e} perturbations of convex Hamiltonians, see [9, 10]. It is proved in [10] that the same result holds : If H is a convex Hamiltonian and a is a regular value of H, then there exist arbitrarily small potentials u such that all periodic orbits (including iterated ones) of H + u at energy a are non-degenerate. The proof given in [10] is actually rather similar to the ones given in papers on the perturbations of Riemannian metrics. In all these proofs, it is very useful to work","(584, 18)","This paper investigates the normal form near orbit segments of convex Hamiltonian systems. We introduce the necessary mathematical framework and tools for the study of convex Hamiltonian systems, emphasizing the importance of symplectic geometry and canonical transformations. We then consider the existence of normal forms near orbit segments in these systems.

We provide a rigorous analysis of the normal form in convex Hamiltonian systems and derive conditions for its existence. Specifically, we show that these conditions are related to the convexity of the Hamiltonian and the existence of certain types of periodic orbits. Our results provide insight into the dynamical behavior and geometry of these systems, as well as their applications to physics, engineering, and materials science.

Moreover, we apply our findings to the study of some concrete examples of convex Hamiltonian systems. We investigate the normal form near orbit segments in two-dimensional systems with polynomial Hamiltonians and show how the existence of normal forms is related to the topology of the energy surface. We also study a three-dimensional system with a singular potential and show how the existence of certain types of periodic orbits affects the normal form.

Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of convex Hamiltonian systems and their applications.

Coalition formation is a fundamental type of interaction that involves the creation of coherent groupings ","Coalition formation is a fundamental type of interaction that involves the creation of coherent groupings of distinct, autonomous, agents in order to efficiently achieve their individual or collective goals. Forming effective coalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems.

Central to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many possible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually requires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the coalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it was formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a combination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one coalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized.

However, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging due to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows exponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques ranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search all of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution quality, and memory requirements.

With this in mind, we develop an anytime algorithm to solve the coalition structure generation problem. Specifically, the algorithm uses a novel representation of the search space, which partitions the space of possible solutions into sub-spaces such that it is possible to compute upper and lower bounds on the values of the best coalition structures in them. These bounds are then used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the optimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches through the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound technique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s).

In this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition structures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions automatically. Moreover, in order to effectively test our algorithm we develop a new type of input distribution which allows us to generate more reliable benchmarks compared to the input distributions previously used in the field.

Given this new distribution, we show that for 27 agents our algorithm is able to find solutions that are optimal in 0.175% of the time required by the fastest available algorithm in the literature. The algorithm is anytime, and if interrupted before it would have normally terminated, it can still provide a solution that is guaranteed to be within a bound from the optimal one.

Moreover, the guarantees we provide on the quality of the solution are significantly better than those provided by the previous state of the art algorithms designed for this purpose. For example, for the worst case distribution given 25 agents, our algorithm is able to find a 90% efficient solution in around 10% of time it takes to find the optimal solution.","(535, 17)","Coalition formation is a well-established field of research in artificial intelligence, economics, and social choice theory, among others. Its main goal is to investigate how groups of agents can join forces to achieve specific goals and how this cooperation can be sustained over time. One of the fundamental problems in coalition formation is optimal coalition structure generation, which aims to find the best possible way to partition a group of agents into coalitions that maximize a given objective function.

In this paper, we propose an anytime algorithm for optimal coalition structure generation that can be used in a wide range of contexts, from multi-agent systems to political science and organizational management. Our approach is based on a novel combination of search algorithms and decision-theoretic reasoning that allows us to generate high-quality coalition structures with minimal computational overhead.

The key idea behind our algorithm is to iteratively improve an initial coalition structure by exploring neighboring structures that satisfy certain optimality conditions. At each iteration, we use decision-theoretic techniques to evaluate the quality of the current coalition structure and decide whether to continue the search or return the best found result so far. This approach gives us the flexibility to trade-off between the quality of the solution and the time and resources available, making our algorithm ideal for applications with varying time and resource constraints.

We evaluate our algorithm on a set of benchmark instances and compare its performance against state-of-the-art algorithms for coalition structure generation. Our experiments show that our anytime algorithm is highly competitive and outperforms existing approaches in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm scales well to large instances, making it a practical tool for real-world applications.

In conclusion, this paper presents a new anytime algorithm for optimal coalition structure generation that combines search algorithms and decision-theoretic reasoning for high-quality and efficient coalition formation. Our approach is flexible and can be used in a wide range of contexts, from multi-agent systems to political science and organizational management. Our empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm is highly competitive and outperforms existing approaches, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners alike.","(387, 14)","Coalition formation is a fundamental type of interaction that involves the creation of coherent groupings  within a set of self-interested agents.

The paper deals with the automatic analysis of real-life telephone conversations between an agent and ","The paper deals with the automatic analysis of real-life telephone conversations between an agent and a customer of a customer care service (ccs).

The application domain is the public transportation system in Paris and the purpose is to collect statistics about customer problems in order to monitor the service and decide priorities on the intervention for improving user satisfaction. Of primary importance for the analysis is the detection of themes that are the object of customer problems. Themes are defined in the application requirements and are part of the application ontology that is implicit in the ccs documentation. Due to variety of customer population, the structure of conversations with an agent is unpredictable. A conversation may be about one or more themes. Theme mentions can be interleaved with mentions of facts that are irrelevant for the application purpose. Furthermore, in certain conversations theme mentions are localized in specific conversation segments while in other conversations mentions cannot be localized. As a consequence, approaches to feature extraction with and without mention localization are considered. Application domain relevant themes identified by an automatic procedure are expressed by specific sentences whose words are hypothesized by an automatic speech recognition (asr) system. The asr system is error prone.

The word error rates can be very high for many reasons. Among them it is worth mentioning unpredictable background noise, speaker accent, and various types of speech disfluencies. As the application task requires the composition of proportions of theme mentions, a sequential decision strategy is introduced in this paper for performing a survey of the large amount of conversations made available in a given time period. The strategy has to sample the conversations to form a survey containing enough data analyzed with high accuracy so that proportions can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Due to the unpredictable type of theme mentions, it is appropriate to consider methods for theme hypothesization based on global as well as local feature extraction. Two systems based on each type of feature extraction will be considered by the strategy. One of the four methods is novel. It is based on a new definition of density of theme mentions and on the localization of high density zones whose boundaries do not need to be precisely detected. The sequential decision strategy starts by grouping theme hypotheses into sets of different expected accuracy and coverage levels. For those sets for which accuracy can be improved with a consequent increase of coverage a new system with new features is introduced. Its execution is triggered only when specific preconditions are met on the hypotheses generated by the basic four systems. Experimental results are provided on a corpus collected in the call center of the Paris transportation system known as ratp. The results show that surveys with high accuracy and coverage can be composed with the proposed strategy and systems. This makes it possible to apply a previously published proportion estimation approach that takes into account hypothesization errors .","(527, 25)","This paper discusses the identification of multiple topics in human-to-human conversations, a task which is crucial for effective communication and natural language processing. The ability to accurately identify topics in conversations has many applications such as information retrieval, summarization, and sentiment analysis. We begin by reviewing the relevant literature on topic identification and summarize the state-of-the-art techniques for topic modeling. We then introduce a new method based on statistical natural language processing that is designed to improve the accuracy of topic identification in both structured and unstructured conversations. Our approach uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as support vector machines, clustering, and latent semantic analysis to effectively identify multiple topics in conversation. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments on several different datasets. Our results show that our model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on all of the datasets we tested. We also investigate the effects of different conversation characteristics such as topic distribution, conversation length, and topic correlation on topic identification accuracy. 

Finally, we discuss several potential applications of our model in real-world conversational settings. For example, our method could be used to identify key topics in social media discussions or email threads in order to facilitate information retrieval. Our model could also be used to summarize conversations or identify sentiment and emotional tone in conversations.

The goal is to identify multiple topics that are discussed during these conversations. This is a challenging task due to the informal nature of spoken language and the lack of clear boundaries between different topics.

To address this challenge, we employ a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. First, we transcribe the audio recordings of the conversations into text using a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. We then pre-process the transcribed text by tokenizing it into individual words or phrases, removing stop words, and lemmatizing the remaining words to their base form.

Next, we apply a topic modeling technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to the pre-processed text data. LDA is a generative model that represents each document as a mixture of topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words. We set the number of topics to 5, which is a reasonable number given the complexity of the conversations and the limited amount of training data.

To evaluate the performance of our topic modeling approach, we use a range of metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score. We also compare our results with a baseline approach that uses a simple keyword-based method to identify topics. The results show that our LDA-based approach outperforms the baseline approach in terms of all three metrics, with an average F1-score of 0.75 compared to 0.55 for the baseline approach.

In addition to evaluating the performance of our approach, we also conduct a qualitative analysis of the identified topics. We manually annotate a subset of the conversations with the correct topics and then compare these annotations with the topics identified by our LDA model.

The pair-condensed unpolarized spin-$1/2$ Fermi gases have a collective excitation branch in their pair-breaking continuum ","The pair-condensed unpolarized spin-$1/2$ Fermi gases have a collective excitation branch in their pair-breaking continuum (V.A. Andrianov, V.N. Popov, 1976). We study it at zero temperature, with the eigenenergy equation deduced from the linearized time-dependent BCS theory and extended analytically to the lower half complex plane through its branch cut, calculating both the dispersion relation and the spectral weights (quasiparticle residues) of the branch. In the case of BCS superconductors, so called because the effect of the ion lattice is replaced by a short-range electron-electron interaction, we also include the Coulomb interaction and we restrict ourselves to the weak coupling limit $\Delta/\mu\to 0^+$ ($\Delta$ is the order parameter, $\mu $ the chemical potential) and to wavenumbers $q=O(1/\xi)$ where $\xi$ is the size of a pair; when the complex energy $z_q$ is expressed in units of $\Delta$ and $q$ in units of $1/\xi$, the branch follows a universal law insensitive to the Coulomb interaction. In the case of cold atoms in the BEC-BCS crossover, only a contact interaction remains, but the coupling strength $\Delta/\mu$ can take arbitrary values, and we study the branch at any wave number. At weak coupling, we predict three scales, that already mentioned $q\approx 1/\xi$, that $q\approx(\Delta/\mu)^{-1/3}/\xi$ where the real part of the dispersion relation has a minimum and that $q\approx (\mu/\Delta)/\xi\approx k_{\rm F}$ ($k_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave number) where the branch reaches the edge of its existence domain. Near the point where the chemical potential vanishes on the BCS side, $\mu/\Delta\to 0^+$, where $\xi\approx k_{\rm F}$, we find two scales $q\approx(\mu/\Delta)^{1/2}/\xi$ and $q\approx 1/\xi$. In all cases, the branch has a limit $2\Delta$ and a quadratic start at $q=0$. These results were obtained for $\mu>0$, where the eigenenergy equation admits at least two branch points $\epsilon_a(q)$ and $\epsilon_b(q)$ on the positive real axis, and for an analytic continuation through the interval $[\epsilon_a(q),\epsilon_b(q)] $.

We find new continuum branches by performing the analytic continuation through $[\epsilon_b(q),+\infty[$ or even, for $q$ low enough, where there is a third real positive branch point $\epsilon_c(q)$, through $[\epsilon_b(q),\epsilon_c(q)]$ and $[\epsilon_c(q),+\infty[$. On the BEC side $\mu<0$ not previously studied, where there is only one real positive branch point $ \epsilon_a(q)$, we also find new collective excitation branches under the branch cut $[\epsilon_a (q),+\infty[$. For $\mu>0$, some of these new branches have a low-wavenumber exotic hypoacoustic $z_q\approx q^{3/2}$ or hyperacoustic $z_q\approx q^{4/5}$ behavior. For $\mu<0$, we find a hyperacoustic branch and a nonhypoacoustic branch, with a limit $2\Delta$ and a purely real quadratic start at $q=0$ for $\Delta/|\mu|<0.222$.","(645, 14)","The collective excitations in the continuum of pair-condensed Fermi gases have been studied analytically, and scaling laws for these excitations have been derived. This study focuses on the properties and behaviors of these collective excitations, particularly in the low-temperature regime. The analytical study utilizes the finite-temperature Green’s function technique along with the random-phase approximation, providing a theoretical framework for the scaling laws derived. The scaling laws reveal the existence of a characteristic frequency proportional to the square root of the gas’s coupling strength, which scales as a function of density. The analytical treatment of this problem enables us to investigate the properties of the collective excitation branch, such as its spectral weight, lifetime, and damping, and how they vary as a function of temperature and gas parameters. The analytical results obtained in this study have been validated through comparison with earlier works and provide new insights into the collective dynamics of highly correlated Fermi gases, broadening our understanding of their exotic behavior. The derived scaling laws can be used to predict the behavior of these systems under different conditions and parameter regimes, including the quantum critical regime. These results are particularly interesting in the context of ongoing experiments on strongly correlated Fermi gases, where the collective dynamics of these systems remain an unresolved question. The conclusions drawn from this study provide essential information for the design and interpretation of future experiments on highly correlated Fermi gases.

Within this framework, we derive an effective action for the collective excitations of the pair-condensed gas, which captures the essential features of the pair-breaking continuum. By performing a systematic expansion of the effective action in powers of the interaction strength, we are able to identify the leading-order contributions to the collective excitation spectrum, which are found to be governed by a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations.

We show how to transform any set of prioritized propositional defaults into an equivalent set ","We show how to transform any set of prioritized propositional defaults into an equivalent set of parallel (i.e., unprioritized) defaults, in circumscription. We give an algorithm to implement the transform. We show how to use the transform algorithm as a generator of a whole family of inferencing algorithms for circumscription. The method is to employ the transform algorithm as a front end to any inferencing algorithm, e.g., one of the previously available, that handles the parallel (empty) case of prioritization. Our algorithms provide not just coverage of a new expressive class, but also alternatives to previous algorithms for implementing the previously covered class (?layered?) of prioritization. In particular, we give a new query-answering algorithm for prioritized cirumscription which is sound and complete for the full expressive class of unrestricted finite prioritization partial orders, for propositional defaults (or minimized predicates). By contrast, previous algorithms required that the prioritization partial order be layered, i.e., structured similar to the system of rank in the military. Our algorithm enables, for the first time, the implementation of the most useful class of prioritization: non-layered prioritization partial orders. Default inheritance, for example, typically requires non-layered prioritization to represent specificity adequately. Our algorithm enables not only the implementation of default inheritance (and specificity) within prioritized circumscription, but also the extension and combination of default inheritance with other kinds of prioritized default reasoning, e.g.: with stratified logic programs with negation-as-failure. Such logic programs are previously known to be representable equivalently as layered-priority predicate circumscriptions.

Worst-case, the transform increases the number of defaults exponentially. We discuss how inferencing is practically implementable nevertheless in two kinds of situations: general expressiveness but small numbers of defaults, or expressive special cases with larger numbers of defaults. One such expressive special case is non-?top-heaviness? of the prioritization partial order. In addition to its direct implementation, the transform can also be exploited analytically to generate special case algorithms, e.g., a tractable transform for a class within default inheritance (detailed in another, forthcoming paper). We discuss other aspects of the significance of the fundamental result.

One can view the transform as reducing n degrees of partially ordered belief confidence to just 2 degrees of confidence: for-sure and (unprioritized) default. Ordinary, parallel default reasoning, e.g., in parallel circumscription or Poole's Theorist, can be viewed in these terms as reducing 2 degrees of confidence to just 1 degree of confidence: that of the non-monotonic theory's conclusions. The expressive reduction's computational complexity suggests that prioritization is valuable for its expressive conciseness, just as defaults are for theirs. For Reiter's Default Logic and Poole's Theorist, the transform implies how to extend those formalisms so as to equip them with a concept of prioritization that is exactly equivalent to that in circumscription. This provides an interesting alternative to Brewka's approach to equipping them with prioritization-type precedence.","(547, 24)","Abstract:

The process of default reasoning has been widely studied in artificial intelligence and logic. Defaults play a key role in handling incomplete information and making assumptions about the world. However, prioritized defaults and specificity can lead to conflicts and inconsistencies when used in parallel systems. In this paper, we propose a new approach that transforms prioritized defaults and specificity into parallel defaults, which can be used to overcome these issues.

Our approach involves representing defaults as sets of parallel rules, each with their own level of specificity. These parallel defaults can be evaluated simultaneously, allowing for more efficient and consistent reasoning. We also introduce a method for resolving conflicts between parallel defaults using a priority ranking scheme. This scheme assigns priorities to different defaults based on their specificity and allows for the selection of a single default when conflicts arise.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several experiments, including benchmark problems and real-world examples.

Our research question is: given a prioritized default theory, how can we transform it into an equivalent parallel default theory? To answer this question, we first need to understand what prioritized and parallel default theories are. A prioritized default theory is a set of defaults, where each default has a priority level associated with it. The priority level determines the order in which the defaults are applied when there is a conflict between them. A parallel default theory, on the other hand, consists of a set of defaults that are applied in parallel, without any priority levels.

Our methodology involves developing a formal framework for transforming prioritized default theories into parallel default theories.

We then prove that this mapping is sound and complete, meaning that it preserves the logical consequences of the original theory.

To develop this framework, we use a combination of logical and algebraic techniques. We represent prioritized defaults as pairs of formulas, where the first formula represents the condition under which the default is applicable, and the second formula represents the conclusion that is drawn when the default is applied.

Context: The algorithms for generating a safe fluent API are actively studied these years. A ","Context: The algorithms for generating a safe fluent API are actively studied these years. A safe fluent API is the fluent API that reports incorrect chaining of the API methods as a type error to the API users. Although such a safe property improves the productivity of its users, the construction of a safe fluent API is too complicated for the developers. The generation algorithms are studied to reduce the development cost of a safe fluent API. The study on the generation would benefit a number of programmers since a fluent API is a popular design in the real world.

Inquiry: The generation of a generic fluent API has been left untackled. A generic fluent API refers to the fluent API that provides generic methods (methods that contain type parameters in their definitions). The Stream API in Java is an example of such a generic API. The recent research on the safe fluent API generation rather focuses on the grammar class that the algorithm can deal with for syntax checking. The key idea of the previous study is to use nested generics to represent a stack structure for the parser built on top of the type system. In that idea, the role of a type parameter was limited to internally representing a stack element of that parser on the type system. The library developers could not use type parameters to include a generic method in their API so that the semantic constraints for their API would be statically checked, for example, the type constraint on the items passed through a stream.

Approach: We propose an algorithm to generate a generic fluent API. Our translation algorithm is modeled as the construction of deterministic finite automaton (DFA) with type parameter information. Each state of the DFA holds information about which type parameters are already bound in that state. This information is used to identify whether a method invocation in a chain newly binds a type to a type parameter, or refers to a previously bound type. The identification is required since a type parameter in a chain is bound at a particular method invocation, and that bound type is referred to in the following method invocations. Our algorithm constructs the DFA by analyzing the binding time of type parameters and their propagation among the states in a DFA that is naively constructed from the given grammar.

Knowledge and Importance: Our algorithm helps library developers to develop a generic fluent API. The ability to generate a generic fluent API is essential to bring the safe fluent API generation to the real world since the use of type parameters is a common technique in the library API design. By our algorithm, the generation of a safe fluent API will be ready for practical use.

Grounding: We implemented a generator named Protocool to demonstrate our algorithm. We also generated several libraries using Protocool to show the ability and the limitations of our algorithm.","(527, 23)","In the world of software development, application programming interfaces (APIs) are essential for working with libraries and frameworks. They allow developers to access pre-written code and build upon it to create new applications. A fluent API is a type of API that is designed to be easy to read and write, providing more natural language-like syntax that feels like a domain-specific language (DSL). This paper presents a methodology for generating a generic fluent API in Java.

The proposed methodology involves the use of code generation and automated testing. The process starts with the identification of a domain-specific language that will be used to generate the fluent API. This DSL is then used to generate the code for the API using a code generation tool. The generated code is tested using a suite of automated tests to ensure that it is correct and meets the desired specifications.

The benefits of using a fluent API in Java are substantial. The more natural language-like syntax reduces the cognitive overhead of learning new APIs and makes code more readable. In addition, the fluent API makes it easier to create complex chains of operations, reducing the amount of boilerplate code that would be necessary with a traditional API.

The generic nature of the proposed fluent API means that it can be used in a wide variety of applications. By defining a domain-specific language, developers can tailor the API to the specific needs of their application while still benefiting from the simplified syntax of a fluent API.

To validate the effectiveness of the methodology, we conducted a case study in which we created a fluent API for a sample application. The results of the case study showed that the generated code was correct and met the desired specifications. In addition, the resulting code was easier to read and write than a traditional API.

In conclusion, the proposed methodology for generating a generic fluent API in Java provides a powerful tool for developers to create more readable and maintainable code. The use of code generation and automated testing ensures that the resulting API is correct and meets the desired specifications.

The purpose of the paper is to give a general framework to define F (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1 ,. .. , --$\lambda$ k $\Delta$T k) where F belongs to a natural class of holomorphic functions defined on suitable open subsets of C k containing the ""Arveson spectrum"" of (--$\lambda$1$\Delta$T 1 ,. .. , --$\lambda$ k $\Delta$T k), where $\Delta$T 1 ,. .. , $\Delta$T k are the infinitesimal generators of commuting one-parameter semigroups of multipliers on A belonging to one of the following classes (1) The class of strongly continous semigroups T = (T (te ia)t>0 such that $\cup$t>0T (te ia)A is dense in A, where a $\in$ R. (2) The class of semigroups T = (T ($\zeta$)) $\zeta$$\in$S a,b holomorphic on an open sector S a,b such that T ($\zeta$)A is dense in A for some, or equivalently for all $\zeta$ $\in$ S a,b. We use the notion of quasimultiplier, introduced in 1981 by the author at the Long Beach Conference on Banach algebras: the generators of the semigroups under consideration will be defined as quasimultipliers on A, and for $\zeta$ in the Arveson resolvent set $\sigma$ar($\Delta$T) the resolvent ($\Delta$T -- $\zeta$I) --1 will be defined as a regular quasimultiplier on A, i.e. a quasimultiplier S on A such that sup n$\ge$1 $\lambda$ n S n u < +$\infty$ for some $\lambda$ > 0 and some u generating a dense ideal of A and belonging to the intersection of the domains of S n , n $\ge$ 1. The first step consists in ""normalizing"" the Banach algebra A, i.e. continuously embedding A in a Banach algebra B having the same quasi-multiplier algebra as A but for which lim sup t$\rightarrow$0 + T (te ia) M(B) < +$\infty$ if T belongs to the class (1), and for which lim sup $\zeta$$\rightarrow$0 $\zeta$$\in$S $\alpha$,$\beta$ T ($\zeta$) < +$\infty$ for all pairs ($\alpha$, $\beta$) such that a < $\alpha$ < $\beta$ < b if T belongs to the class (2).

In particular, a holomorphic functional calculus is developed for finite families of commuting semigroups. This calculus allows for the computation of complex functions of such semigroups in a manner that is analogous to the familiar calculus of functions of a single variable.

The paper begins with an overview of functional calculus for operators and its applications. A variety of examples are explored to demonstrate the usefulness and versatility of the concept. In particular, it is shown that many important properties of operators can be simplified by using functional calculus.

The main focus of the paper is the development of a holomorphic functional calculus for finite families of commuting semigroups. The calculus is based on the observation that functions of commuting semigroups are themselves commuting semigroups. As a result, it is possible to define a unique calculus for these objects in a natural way.

The calculus is developed step-by-step, with each stage building on the previous one. Careful attention is paid to the properties of the calculus, such as linearity, continuity, and differentiability. In addition, the author provides a detailed discussion of the relationship between the calculus and other approaches to the same problem.

Numerous examples and applications are presented throughout the paper to illustrate the power and elegance of the holomorphic functional calculus. These include applications in operator theory, harmonic analysis, and partial differential equations. In each case, it is shown that the calculus provides a powerful and unified framework for solving problems that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to tackle.

The paper concludes with a discussion of future directions for research in the area of functional calculus for operators. The author notes that there is much work still to be done in this field, and that the development of new calculi for more general families of operators is likely to be an important area of focus in the coming years.

This article deals with the design of saturated controls in the context of partial differential ","This article deals with the design of saturated controls in the context of partial differential equations. It focuses on a Korteweg-de Vries equation, which is a nonlinear mathematical model of waves on shallow water surfaces. Two different types of saturated controls are considered. The well-posedness is proven applying a Banach fixed point theorem, using some estimates of this equation and some properties of the saturation function. The proof of the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is separated in two cases: i) when the control acts on all the domain, a Lyapunov function together with a sector condition describing the saturating input is used to conclude on the stability, ii) when the control is localized, we argue by contradiction. Some numerical simulations illustrate the stability of the closed-loop nonlinear partial differential equation. 1. Introduction. In recent decades, a great effort has been made to take into account input saturations in control designs (see e.g [39], [15] or more recently [17]). In most applications, actuators are limited due to some physical constraints and the control input has to be bounded. Neglecting the amplitude actuator limitation can be source of undesirable and catastrophic behaviors for the closed-loop system. The standard method to analyze the stability with such nonlinear controls follows a two steps design. First the design is carried out without taking into account the saturation. In a second step, a nonlinear analysis of the closed-loop system is made when adding the saturation. In this way, we often get local stabilization results. Tackling this particular nonlinearity in the case of finite dimensional systems is already a difficult problem. However, nowadays, numerous techniques are available (see e.g. [39, 41, 37]) and such systems can be analyzed with an appropriate Lyapunov function and a sector condition of the saturation map, as introduced in [39]. In the literature, there are few papers studying this topic in the infinite dimensional case. Among them, we can cite [18], [29], where a wave equation equipped with a saturated distributed actuator is studied, and [12], where a coupled PDE/ODE system modeling a switched power converter with a transmission line is considered. Due to some restrictions on the system, a saturated feedback has to be designed in the latter paper. There exist also some papers using the nonlinear semigroup theory and focusing on abstract systems ([20],[34],[36]). Let us note that in [36], [34] and [20], the study of a priori bounded controller is tackled using abstract nonlinear theory. To be more specific, for bounded ([36],[34]) and unbounded ([34]) control operators, some conditions are derived to deduce, from the asymptotic stability of an infinite-dimensional linear system in abstract form, the asymptotic stability when closing the loop with saturating controller. These articles use the nonlinear semigroup theory (see e.g. [24] or [1]). The Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV for short)","(582, 27)","This paper addresses the problem of global stabilization of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation by means of a saturating distributed control mechanism. KdV is a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) which describes the propagation of weakly nonlinear, dispersive waves in certain physical contexts. It is an important model for various physical phenomena, such as the behavior of shallow water waves in a canal. However, the KdV equation is known to be ill-posed in the sense that small perturbations can grow exponentially in time.

In order to overcome this issue, researchers have developed various control and feedback strategies for the KdV equation. In particular, distributed control mechanisms have proven to be effective in stabilizing the system. This paper presents a new approach to distributed control of the KdV equation, using a saturating control law.

The proposed control law is defined as a function of the solution to the KdV equation itself, as well as its spatial derivative. This allows for a distributed control mechanism which depends only on local information about the system. The control law is also designed to saturate for large values of the solution, ensuring that the control effort is limited in magnitude.

The main result of the paper is the proof of global exponential stability of the closed-loop system, i.e., the stabilized KdV equation with the proposed control law. This means that any solution to the KdV equation subjected to the saturating distributed control law will converge exponentially fast to a unique equilibrium. The proof of this result relies on Lyapunov functional techniques and exhibits a decay rate for the convergence.

Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. The simulations show that the closed-loop system behaves consistently with the theoretical results, even in the presence of external disturbances. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential applications of the proposed control strategy in practical settings.

In summary, this paper presents a new approach to the problem of global stabilization of the KdV equation using a saturating distributed control law. The proposed control mechanism is effective in stabilizing the system and ensuring its global exponential stability.

Multiparty session types (MST) are a well-established type theory that describes the interactive structure of ","Multiparty session types (MST) are a well-established type theory that describes the interactive structure of a fixed number of components from a global point of view and type-checks the components through projection of the global type onto the participants of the session. They guarantee communicationsafety for a language of multiparty sessions (LMS), i.e., distributed, parallel components can exchange values without deadlocking and unexpected message types. Several variants of MST and LMS have been proposed to study key features of distributed and parallel programming. We observe that the population of the considered variants follows from only one ancestor, i.e., the original LMS/MST, and there are overlapping traits between features of the considered variants and the original. These hamper evolution of session types and languages and their adoption in practice. This paper addresses the following question: What are the essential features for MST and LMS, and how can these be modelled with simple constructs? To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this question has been addressed. We performed a systematic analysis of the features and the constructs in MST, LMS, and the considered variants to identify the essential features. The variants are among the most influential (according to Google Scholar) and well-established systems that cover a wide set of areas in distributed, parallel programming. We used classical techniques of formal models such as BNF, structural congruence, small step operational semantics and typing judgments to build our language and type system. Lastly, the coherence of operational semantics and type system is proven by induction. This paper proposes a set of essential features, a language of structured interactions and a type theory of comprehensive multiparty session types, including global types and type system. The analysis removes overlapping features and captures the shared traits, thereby introducing the essential features. The constructs of the language are simple and fundamental, based on the $\lambda$ and $\pi$ calculi. Analogously, our global types reflect what is omitted and introduced in the language. Our system covers all the features of the original and variants, with a better ratio of the number of language and type constructs over the number of covered features.

The features of the original, variants, and our system along with the number of constructs in the respective language and global types to model them are presented through a table. The syntax, operational semantics, meta-theory and type system of our system are given. We modelled all the motivating examples of the variants in our model, describing the reduction and typing steps. The work discusses how new features, in particular the non-essential ones (formerly excluded) and advanced ones can be either modelled atop the essential ones or added with minimal efforts, i.e. without modifying the existing ones. The fundamental properties of typed processes such as subject reduction, communication safety, and progress are established.","(532, 22)","Multiparty session types are a powerful tool for specifying communication protocols in distributed systems, ensuring that processes interact in a coordinated way, and preventing deadlocks and other types of errors. However, existing approaches to multiparty session types have limitations that restrict their applicability in various settings.

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multiparty session types that overcomes many of these limitations. Specifically, it introduces a new syntax for specifying session types that supports complex interactions involving multiple parties, nested sessions, and recursive protocols. The syntax also facilitates the integration of session types with programming languages and software tools, making it easier to develop and verify correct implementations of session-based protocols.

In addition to the new syntax, this framework also includes a type system for statically verifying the correctness of multiparty communications. The type system captures various properties of session types, such as the order and type of messages exchanged between parties, and ensures that these properties are preserved throughout the communication session. The type system can detect many errors at compile-time, preventing many types of runtime errors that may occur in improperly specified communication protocols.

To illustrate the usefulness of this framework, we apply it to several case studies, including a distributed auction system, a chat room, and a network protocol for distributed database systems. These case studies demonstrate the flexibility and generality of the framework, as well as its ability to catch errors and enforce correct behavior in complex, real-world systems.

Overall, this paper offers a comprehensive and powerful tool for specifying multiparty communication protocols in distributed systems. Its new syntax and type system provide a flexible, integrated approach to session types that can improve the correctness and reliability of communication protocols in a variety of domains.

We argue about the (non) existence of {\it superregular} scalar clouds (i.e., bound states of ","We argue about the (non) existence of {\it superregular} scalar clouds (i.e., bound states of a massive and complex-valued scalar field $\Psi$) around exact {\it extremal} ($a = M$) Kerr black holes (BH's) possessing {\it bounded radial derivatives at the horizon} (in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates) as opposed to similar cloud solutions that exist but with unbounded derivatives in the same coordinate system. The latter solutions have been reported recently both analytically and numerically. The superregular clouds cannot be obtained from the regular clouds around subextremal Kerr BH's ($|a|< M$) in the limit of extremality $(a\rightarrow M)$ as in this limit the radial derivatives of $\Psi$ at the horizon $r_H$ diverge when $r_H\rightarrow r_H^{\rm ext}:=M=a$, thus, such superregular clouds must be analyzed separately. We conclude that the superregular clouds, which are found in the {\it exact} extremal scenario ($a = M$), are not continuously connected with the regular ones in the limit of extremality $(a\rightarrow M)$. Remarkably, the spectrum leading to the existence of the radial part of the full solution of these superregular clouds (which obeys a Teukolsky equation) is given by the exact formula $M=a=\frac{1}{2\mu}\sqrt{m^2 + \left[-\kappa+\sqrt{\kappa^2+m^2}\,\right]^2}$, which depends on three (positive) integers: the principal number $n$, the {\it magnetic number} $m$, and an integer $j$, related with the {\it type} of regularity at the horizon. Here $\kappa= j +n$, and $\mu$ is the mass associated with $\Psi$. This spectrum depends implicitly on the {\it orbital} number $l$, an integer number that determines the existence of well behaved spheroidal harmonics which are associated with the angular part of the cloud solution. Since the separation constants that are obtained from the superregularity conditions in the radial part of the solution do {\it not} coincide in general with the standard separation constants required for the spheroidal harmonics to be well behaved on the axis of symmetry, we conclude that non-trivial boson clouds having such superregularity conditions cannot exist in the background of an exact extremal Kerr BH. The only exception to this conclusion is in the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $m\ll n$. In such a large $n$ limit consistency in the separation constants leads to a quadratic Diophantine equation of Pell's type for the integer numbers $(l,m)$. Such Pell's equation can be readily solved using standard techniques. In that instance well behaved spheroidal harmonics are obtained, and thus, well behaved non-trivial superregular clouds can be computed. Of course, this situation, does not preclude the existence of other kind of smooth cloud solutions for any other $n$, not necessarily large (e.g. clouds with a non-integer $\kappa$) when using a better behaved coordinate system at the horizon (e.g. Wheeler's tortoise coordinate or proper radial distance).","(600, 15)","This paper presents a study on the existence and non-existence of superregular boson clouds around extremal Kerr black holes, and its connection with number theory. The research is motivated by the recent advances in the understanding of the properties of black holes, which have revealed a rich interplay between geometry, topology, and quantum physics.

We first define the notion of superregular boson clouds and their relevance to black hole physics. We then investigate the conditions under which such clouds can exist or not exist around extremal Kerr black holes, and analyze their implications for the structure and dynamics of the black hole.

Our analysis is based on a combination of numerical simulations and analytical methods, which allow us to explore the intricate interplay between the geometry of the black hole and the quantum properties of these cloud configurations. We show that there is a close connection between the existence of superregular boson clouds and the properties of certain number-theoretic functions, which play a fundamental role in the study of the geometry of black holes.

We also investigate the physical properties of these cloud configurations, such as their energy, angular momentum, and entropy, and discuss their relevance for the understanding of the thermodynamics and information content of black holes.

Our results have implications for the broader theoretical framework of physics, including quantum field theory, general relativity, and number theory. They provide new insights into the intricate connections between geometry, topology, and quantum physics, and point to new directions for future research in these areas.

We conclude by highlighting the importance of a deeper understanding of the properties of black holes and their connections with fundamental physics, and the potential for such investigations to yield new insights into the nature of the universe at its most fundamental level.","(324, 10)","We argue about the (non) existence of {\it superregular} scalar clouds (i.e., bound states of  massless scalar fields) around extremal rotating black holes in four-dimensional general relativity. Our investigation is motivated by the recent discovery of regular scalar clouds around non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black holes \cite{Herdeiro:2014goa} and rotating (Kerr) black holes with non-extremal angular momentum \cite{Dias:2015wds}. The extremal case, however, remains largely unexplored due to the degeneracy of the black hole's event horizon and the concomitant breakdown of perturbative methods.

To address this issue, we employ a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. First, we use the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli (RWZ) formalism \cite{Regge:1957td,Wheeler:1957mu,Zerilli:1971wd} to derive a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the linear perturbations of the extremal Kerr black hole. These ODEs are then solved numerically using a shooting method, which allows us to compute the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the black hole. The QNMs are the complex frequencies at which the perturbations oscillate, and they play a crucial role in determining the stability of the black hole against scalar field perturbations.

Our numerical results indicate that, unlike the non-extremal case, there are no superregular scalar clouds around extremal Kerry black holes. Specifically, we find that the QNMs of the extremal black hole have a positive imaginary part, indicating that any scalar field perturbation will eventually decay away from the black hole. This result is consistent with the expectation that extremal black holes are more stable than their non-extremal counterparts.

However, our investigation also reveals a surprising connection between the non-existence of superregular scalar clouds and number theory. We show that the absence of superregular clouds can be attributed to the failure of the RWZ formalism to capture the correct asymptotic behavior of the perturbation equations near the black hole's horizon. This failure is, in turn, related to the fact that the extremal Kerr solution has a degenerate event horizon, which leads to a breakdown of the usual separation of variables in the perturbation equations.

Boiling crisis is the rapid formation of the quasi-continuous vapor film between the heater and ","Boiling crisis is the rapid formation of the quasi-continuous vapor film between the heater and the liquid when the heat supply exceeds a critical value. We propose a mechanism for the boiling crisis that is based on the spreading of the dry spot under a vapor bubble. The spreading is initiated by the vapor recoil force, a force coming from the liquid evaporation into the bubble. Since the evaporation intensity increases sharply near the triple contact line, the influence of the vapor recoil can be described as a change of the apparent contact angle. Therefore, for the most usual case of complete wetting of the heating surface by the liquid, the boiling crisis can be understood as a drying transition from complete to partial wetting. The state of nucleate boiling, which is boiling in its usual sense, is characterized by a very large rate of heat transfer from the heating surface to the bulk because the superheated liquid is carried away from the heating surface by the departing vapor bubbles. If the heating power is increased, the temperature of the heating surface increases with the heat flux. When the heat flux from the heater reaches a threshold value q CHF (the critical heat flux, CHF), the vapor bubbles suddenly form a film which covers the heating surface and insulates the latter from the bulk of the liquid. The temperature of the heating surface grows so rapidly that the heater can fuse unless its power is controlled. This phenomenon is known under the names of ""boiling crisis,"" ""burnout,"" or ""Departure from Nucleate Boiling"" (DNB) [1]. The final state of this transition is called film boiling. This problem has become very important since the 1940's, with the beginning of the industrial exploitation of heat exchangers with large heat fluxes (as with nuclear power stations). Since then a huge amount of research has been done for the various conditions of pool boiling (boiling without imposed external flow) and flow boiling (boiling of the flowing water) [2]. Numerous empirical correlations have been proposed, each describing the dependence of the CHF on the physical parameters of the liquid and of the heater more or less correctly for a particular geometry and particular conditions of boiling [2]. A strong dependence of the threshold on the details of the experimental setup coupled with difficulties in separating the consequences of DNB from its causes is at the origin of a large number of frequently controversial hypotheses [2]. The violence of boiling makes observations quite difficult. Good quality photographic experiments are presented in only a few articles (see e.g. [3] -- [6]). Despite an increasing interest in the physical aspect of the problem during recent years [7,8] and numerous empirical approaches, the underlying physics still remains obscure. In this Letter, we propose a model based on a non-equilibrium drying transition.","(539, 20)","This research paper delves into the fascinating phenomena of boiling crisis and non-equilibrium drying transition from the perspective of thermodynamics and heat transfer. Boiling crisis is an abrupt and dramatic reduction in boiling efficiency, characterized by a sudden increase in surface temperature and a drop in heat transfer coefficient. Such a phenomenon can cause damage to critical heat transfer systems such as nuclear reactors, steam turbines, and electronic devices. In contrast, non-equilibrium drying transition is a transition from the film stage to the particulate stage, which often occurs during the drying of granular materials in the presence of a gas flow. Understanding the dynamics of these two transitions is of paramount importance in designing and optimizing thermal systems.

This research employs a combination of theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental measurements to investigate the fundamental mechanisms and thermophysical properties involved in boiling crisis and non-equilibrium drying transition. We first develop a comprehensive thermodynamic model to describe the dynamics of boiling crisis, which takes into account the effects of subcooled boiling and wall superheat. The model is validated by comparing its predictions to available experimental data and shows good agreement. We then use the model to explore the effects of different parameters, such as pressure, surface roughness, and liquid properties, on the onset and development of boiling crisis.

Next, we transfer our focus to non-equilibrium drying transition and investigate the evolution of particle size distribution and concentration during the transition. We perform numerical simulations based on a discrete element method to capture the motions of individual particles and their interactions with the gas flow. The simulations reveal that the transition is driven by a balance between the convective force and the interparticle cohesive force. We further validate the simulations by comparing the predictions to experiments using an optical microscope and laser diffraction. Our results show that the non-equilibrium drying transition can significantly affect the overall heat and mass transfer during drying.

Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of complex thermodynamic and transport phenomena related to boiling crisis and non-equilibrium drying transition. Our work can be used to design and optimize thermal systems with higher efficiency and reliability. Future research can further extend the study to more complex geometries and fluid systems and investigate the effects of surface geometry and material properties.","(412, 17)","Boiling crisis is the rapid formation of the quasi-continuous vapor film between the heater and  working fluid in a boiling system, leading to a significant reduction in heat transfer efficiency.

Context. Using observations to deduce dust properties, grain size distribution, and physical conditions in molecular ","Context. Using observations to deduce dust properties, grain size distribution, and physical conditions in molecular clouds is a highly degenerate problem. Aims. The coreshine phenomenon, a scattering process at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m that dominates absorption, has revealed its ability to explore the densest parts of clouds. We want to use this effect to constrain the dust parameters. The goal is to investigate to what extent grain growth (at constant dust mass) inside molecular clouds is able to explain the coreshine observations. We aim to find dust models that can explain a sample of Spitzer coreshine data. We also look at the consistency with near-infrared data we obtained for a few clouds. Methods. We selected four regions with a very high occurrence of coreshine cases: Taurus-Perseus, Cepheus, Chameleon and L183/L134. We built a grid of dust models and investigated the key parameters to reproduce the general trend of surface bright- nesses and intensity ratios of both coreshine and near-infrared observations with the help of a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. The grid parameters allow to investigate the effect of coagulation upon spherical grains up to 5 $\mu$m in size derived from the DustEm diffuse interstellar medium grains. Fluffiness (porosity or fractal degree), ices, and a handful of classical grain size distributions were also tested. We used the near- and mostly mid-infrared intensity ratios as strong discriminants between dust models. Results. The determination of the background field intensity at each wavelength is a key issue. In particular, an especially strong background field explains why we do not see coreshine in the Galactic plane at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. For starless cores, where detected, the observed 4.5 $\mu$m / 3.6 $\mu$m coreshine intensity ratio is always lower than $\sim$0.5 which is also what we find in the models for the Taurus-Perseus and L183 directions. Embedded sources can lead to higher fluxes (up to four times greater than the strongest starless core fluxes) and higher coreshine ratios (from 0.5 to 1.1 in our selected sample). Normal interstellar radiation field conditions are sufficient to find suitable grain models at all wavelengths for starless cores. The standard interstellar grains are not able to reproduce observations and, due to the multi-wavelength approach, only a few grain types meet the criteria set by the data. Porosity does not affect the flux ratios while the fractal dimension helps to explain coreshine ratios but does not seem able to reproduce near-infrared observations without a mix of other grain types. Conclusions. Combined near- and mid-infrared wavelengths confirm the potential to reveal the nature and size distribution of dust grains. Careful assessment of the environmental parameters (interstellar and background fields, embedded or nearby reddened sources) is required to validate this new diagnostic.","(519, 25)","Dust is a crucial component of the interstellar medium, contributing to the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. In particular, the study of dust properties inside molecular clouds is essential for understanding the physical conditions that lead to star formation. In this work, we present a study on the dust properties inside molecular clouds based on coreshine modeling and observations.

Coreshine is a phenomenon observed in dense cores of molecular clouds, where the emission from the dust at long wavelengths is enhanced due to scattering of the interstellar radiation field. We use the coreshine observations obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory and model them using a radiative transfer simulation code. Our aim is to derive the dust properties inside the cores, such as the dust temperature, opacity, and spectral index.

We find that the dust temperature inside the cores is generally lower than the surrounding cloud, which implies that the cores are shielded from the interstellar radiation field. The opacity of the dust is also higher inside the cores, indicating that the dust grains are larger and more abundant than in the surrounding cloud. The spectral index of the dust inside the cores is flatter than the surrounding cloud, indicating the presence of larger dust grains.

We also study the relation between the dust properties and the physical properties of the cores, such as their mass and size. We find that the dust temperature and spectral index are correlated with the core mass, implying that the more massive cores have lower temperatures and larger dust grains. We also find that the dust opacity is correlated with the core size, implying that the larger cores have more abundant and larger dust grains.

Finally, we compare our results with previous studies and theoretical models of dust properties inside molecular clouds. We find that our results are consistent with the idea that the dust properties inside the cores are determined by the physical conditions of the cores, such as the density and temperature. Our study provides important insights into the dust properties inside molecular clouds and their relation to star formation, which is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies.","(391, 15)","Context. Using observations to deduce dust properties, grain size distribution, and physical conditions in molecular  clouds (MCs) is a long-standing challenge in astrophysics. Coreshine, the diffuse emission from the innermost regions of MCs, offers a unique opportunity to probe these properties. We present a comprehensive analysis of coreshine data from the Herschel Space Observatory and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), combined with state-of-the-art radiative transfer modeling, to investigate dust properties inside MCs.

Methodology. Our study focuses on a sample of 20 MCs observed by Herschel and ALMA, covering a range of masses, sizes, and evolutionary stages. We employ a two-step approach: (1) we model the coreshine emission using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, assuming different dust grain size distributions and physical conditions, and (2) we compare the modeled emission with the observed data to constrain the dust properties. We consider various dust models, including MRN (Mathis-Rumpl-Nordsieck) and power-law distributions, as well as different dust opacities and temperatures.

Findings. Our analysis reveals that the observed coreshine emission can be well-reproduced by our radiative transfer models, providing strong constraints on dust properties. We find that the dust grain size distribution in MCs is best described by a power-law distribution with a slope of -3.5 ± 0.5, which is steeper than the MRN distribution. The dust opacity is found to be higher than previously thought, with an average value of 10.5 ± 2.5 m^2 kg^-1 at 250 μm. The dust temperature is found to be around 10-15 K, consistent with previous studies. We also observe a correlation between the dust opacity and the gas density, suggesting that dust growth is enhanced in denser regions.

Implications. Our results have significant implications for our understanding of dust properties in MCs and the formation of stars. The steeper dust grain size distribution and higher dust opacity suggest that dust growth is more efficient in MCs than previously thought, potentially leading to the formation of larger dust grains and, ultimately, planets. The correlation between dust opacity and gas density implies that dust growth is a key process in the early stages of star formation.

Context: Meta programming consists for a large part of matching, analyzing, and transforming syntax trees. ","Context: Meta programming consists for a large part of matching, analyzing, and transforming syntax trees. Many meta programming systems process abstract syntax trees, but this requires intimate knowledge of the structure of the data type describing the abstract syntax. As a result, meta programming is error-prone, and meta programs are not resilient to evolution of the structure of such ASTs, requiring invasive, fault-prone change to these programs.

Inquiry: Concrete syntax patterns alleviate this problem by allowing the meta programmer to match and create syntax trees using the actual syntax of the object language. Systems supporting concrete syntax patterns, however, require a concrete grammar of the object language in their own formalism. Creating such grammars is a costly and error-prone process, especially for realistic languages such as Java and C++. Approach: In this paper we present Concretely, a technique to extend meta programming systems with pluggable concrete syntax patterns, based on external, black box parsers. We illustrate Concretely in the context of Rascal, an open-source meta programming system and language workbench, and show how to reuse existing parsers for Java, JavaScript, and C++. Furthermore, we propose Tympanic, a DSL to declaratively map external AST structures to Rascal's internal data structures. Tympanic allows implementors of Concretely to solve the impedance mismatch between object-oriented class hierarchies in Java and Rascal's algebraic data types. Both the algebraic data type and AST marshalling code is automatically generated. Knowledge: The conceptual architecture of Concretely and Tympanic supports the reuse of pre-existing, external parsers, and their AST representation in meta programming systems that feature concrete syntax patterns for matching and constructing syntax trees. As such this opens up concrete syntax pattern matching for a host of realistic languages for which writing a grammar from scratch is time consuming and error-prone, but for which industry-strength parsers exist in the wild. Grounding: We evaluate Concretely in terms of source lines of code (SLOC), relative to the size of the AST data type and marshalling code. We show that for real programming languages such as C++ and Java, adding support for concrete syntax patterns takes an effort only in the order of dozens of SLOC. Similarly, we evaluate Tympanic in terms of SLOC, showing an order of magnitude of reduction in SLOC compared to manual implementation of the AST data types and marshalling code. Importance: Meta programming has applications in reverse engineering, reengineering, source code analysis, static analysis, software renovation, domain-specific language engineering, and many others. Processing of syntax trees is central to all of these tasks.

Concrete syntax patterns improve the practice of constructing meta programs.

The combination of Concretely and Tympanic has the potential to make concrete syntax patterns available with very little effort, thereby improving and promoting the application of meta programming in the general software engineering context.","(524, 20)","Concrete syntax is an essential component of computer languages. Despite its critical role, the development of tools to support it has been slow. Black box parsers, however, offer a potential solution to this longstanding issue. By treating the syntax of languages as abstract objects, black box parsers provide a way to create languages without being bound by specific syntax rules.

The flexibility of black box parsers is one of their key advantages. Rather than relying on a specific set of syntax rules, they can parse input according to any set of rules. This enables developers to experiment with different syntaxes, create syntaxes that fit their specific needs, or even build new languages that are not bound by traditional syntax rules.

Another benefit of black box parsers is their ability to facilitate the use of concrete syntax in large-scale software projects. With black box parsers, developers can separate the concerns of language specification and language use. This allows developers to focus their efforts on the parts of the software that matter most, without being bogged down by the intricacies of language syntax.

In addition to their flexibility and scalability, black box parsers are also highly efficient. They can rapidly parse large amounts of code, making them an ideal solution for complex software projects.

Despite their many advantages, black box parsers are not without their limitations. For one, they can be difficult to understand, particularly for developers who are not familiar with their inner workings. Additionally, because of their abstract nature, it can be challenging to create error messages that are helpful to end-users.

Nonetheless, the potential benefits of black box parsers make them a promising tool for software development. They offer a flexible, scalable, and efficient way of incorporating concrete syntax into large-scale software projects. While there are still challenges to be addressed, black box parsers represent a significant step forward in the development of computer languages.","(354, 18)","Context: Meta programming consists for a large part of matching, analyzing, and transforming syntax trees.  These syntax trees are typically generated by parsers, which can be either top-down or bottom-up.  Top-down parsers start with the overall structure of the program and recursively break it down into smaller parts, while bottom-up parsers start with the individual tokens of the program and combine them into larger structures.  Both types of parsers have their own strengths and weaknesses, but in general, top-down parsers are more commonly used due to their simplicity and ease of implementation.

Problem: While top-down parsers are widely used, they often require a significant amount of manual effort to implement and maintain, especially for complex programming languages.  This is because top-down parsers need to be manually written to handle the specific syntax of the language, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.  Furthermore, top-down parsers often require a deep understanding of the language's syntax and semantics, which can be a barrier to entry for new developers.

The analysis of practical probabilistic models on the computer demands a convenient representation for the ","The analysis of practical probabilistic models on the computer demands a convenient representation for the available knowledge and an efficient algorithm to perform inference. An appealing representation is the influence diagram, a network that makes explicit the random variables in a model and their probabilistic dependencies. Recent advances have developed solution procedures based on the influence diagram. In this paper, we examine the fundamental properties that underlie those techniques, and the information about the probabilistic structure that is available in the influence diagram representation. The influence diagram is a convenient representation for computer processing while also being clear and non-mathematical. It displays probabilistic dependence precisely, in a way that is intuitive for decision makers and experts to understand and communicate. As a result, the same influence diagram can be used to build, assess and analyze a model, facilitating changes in the formulation and feedback from sensitivity analysis.

The goal in this paper is to determine arbitrary conditional probability distributions from a given probabilistic model. Given qualitative information about the dependence of the random variables in the model we can, for a specific conditional expression, specify precisely what quantitative information we need to be able to determine the desired conditional probability distribution. It is also shown how we can find that probability distribution by performing operations locally, that is, over subspaces of the joint distribution. In this way, we can exploit the conditional independence present in the model to avoid having to construct or manipulate the full joint distribution. These results are extended to include maximal processing when the information available is incomplete, and optimal decision making in an uncertain environment. Influence diagrams as a computer-aided modeling tool were developed by Miller, Merkofer, and Howard [5] and extended by Howard and Matheson [2]. Good descriptions of how to use them in modeling are in Owen [7] and Howard and Matheson [2]. The notion of solving a decision problem through influence diagrams was examined by Olmsted [6] and such an algorithm was developed by Shachter [8]. The latter paper also shows how influence diagrams can be used to perform a variety of sensitivity analyses. This paper extends those results by developing a theory of the properties of the diagram that are used by the algorithm, and the information needed to solve arbitrary probability inference problems. Section 2 develops the notation and the framework for the paper and the relationship between influence diagrams and joint probability distributions. The general probabilistic inference problem is posed in Section 3. In Section 4 the transformations on the diagram are developed and then put together into a solution procedure in Section 5. In Section 6, this procedure is used to calculate the information requirement to solve an inference problem and the maximal processing that can be performed with incomplete information. Section 7 contains a summary of results.","(521, 22)","Intelligent probabilistic inference is a process that determines the likelihood of events occurring based on available evidence. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to probabilistic inference that leverages the power of machine learning to make intelligent decisions.

Traditional probabilistic inference methods are usually rigid, inflexible, and only work under a limited range of assumptions. In contrast, our approach utilizes advancements made in deep learning to handle noisy and incomplete data, and adapt to changing circumstances.

At the core of our approach is a probabilistic graphical model that encodes the relationships between different variables in the system. This allows us to model complex systems and capture uncertainty in a structured way. We employ variational inference to infer the posterior distribution of unobserved variables, which enables us to make predictions about the system.

However, standard variational inference methods are often computationally expensive and cannot handle large datasets. To address this, we leverage techniques such as stochastic gradient descent and amortized inference to scale up the inference process.

Our experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional probabilistic inference methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a range of tasks, including image classification and language modeling.

One advantage of our approach is its ability to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the probabilistic model. For example, we can encode expert knowledge of a domain into the structure of the graphical model, improving its ability to make intelligent predictions.

In addition to its application in machine learning, our approach has practical implications for decision-making in areas such as finance, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles. For example, our approach could be used to predict the likelihood of a stock market crash or determine the optimal dosage for a patient.

Overall, our research presents a novel approach to probabilistic inference that combines the benefits of machine learning with structured probabilistic modeling. Our approach is highly flexible, adaptive, and scalable, making it well-suited for real-world applications.","(366, 17)","The analysis of practical probabilistic models on the computer demands a convenient representation for the  probabilistic relationships between variables. Traditional probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian networks (BNs) and Markov random fields (MRFs), have been widely used in various applications due to their ability to compactly represent complex probabilistic relationships. However, these models often suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where the number of parameters grows exponentially with the number of variables, making them computationally expensive and difficult to learn.

To address this issue, we propose a novel probabilistic graphical model, called the intelligent probabilistic inference (IPI) model, which combines the strengths of BNs and MRFs while avoiding their limitations. The IPI model is based on a hierarchical representation of probabilistic relationships, where each variable is associated with a set of latent variables that capture the underlying structure of the data. This hierarchical representation allows for a more compact and efficient representation of complex probabilistic relationships, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

The IPI model is defined as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node represents a variable, and each edge represents a probabilistic relationship between two variables. The model is parameterized by a set of conditional probability tables (CPTs) that specify the probability of each variable given its parents. The CPTs are learned using a combination of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms, which ensures that the model is consistent with the observed data.

One of the key features of the IPI model is its ability to handle missing data and outliers. The model is designed to be robust to missing values and outliers, which is essential in many real-world applications where data is often incomplete or noisy. The model's robustness is achieved through the use of a modified EM algorithm that takes into account the uncertainty associated with missing values and outliers.

We evaluate the IPI model on several benchmark datasets, including the well-known MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as a real-world dataset from the healthcare domain.

The first purpose of this paper is to point out a curious result announced by ","The first purpose of this paper is to point out a curious result announced by Macaulay on the Hilbert function of a differential module in his famous book The Algebraic Theory of Modular Systems published in 1916. Indeed, on page 78/79 of this book, Macaulay is saying the following: "" A polynomial ideal $\mathfrak{a} \subset k[{\chi}\_1$,..., ${\chi}\_n]=k[\chi]$ is of the {\it principal class} and thus {\it unmixed} if it has rank $r$ and is generated by $r$ polynomials. Having in mind this definition, a primary ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ with associated prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} = rad(\mathfrak{q})$ is such that any ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{q}$ determines a primary ideal of greater {\it multiplicity} over $k$. In particular, we have $dim\_k(k[\chi]/({\chi}\_1$,...,${\chi}\_n)^2)=n+1$ because, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the parametric jets are \{${y,y\_1, ...,y\_n}$\} but any ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\mathfrak{a}\subset ({\chi}\_1,{\^a},{\chi}\_n)^2$ is contained into a {\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ such that $rad(\mathfrak{q})=\mathfrak{m}\in max(k[\chi])$ is a maximal and thus prime ideal with $dim\_k(M)=dim\_k(k[\chi]/\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least.

Accordingly, any primary ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the primary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\mathfrak{a} \subseteq \mathfrak{q}$ of the principal class. Otherwise, $\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\it principal noetherian class} "". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern language and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The importance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit symbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of this example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the system of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this reason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is presented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky.

Meanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by Macaulay in order to study {\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular examples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been introduced recently in order to study {\it pure differential modules}. However these procedures are based on the formal theory of systems of ordinary differential (OD) or partial differential (PD) equations, in particular on a systematic use of the Spencer operator, and are still not acknowledged by the algebraic community.","(640, 12)","This paper investigates the properties of pure differential modules and their relationship to unmixed polynomial ideals. We begin by defining pure differential modules and exploring their basic algebraic properties. We then present a result of Macaulay which characterizes unmixed polynomial ideals in terms of their associated graded rings. Specifically, Macaulay showed that an ideal is unmixed if and only if its associated graded ring is Cohen-Macaulay.

Using this result, we show that certain classes of pure differential modules are closely related to the Cohen-Macaulay property. In particular, we prove that a pure differential module is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if its associated graded ring is Cohen-Macaulay. This provides a powerful tool for studying pure differential modules and their associated polynomial ideals.

We then turn our attention to a specific example of an unmixed polynomial ideal: the ideal of minors of a matrix. We show that this ideal is Cohen-Macaulay, and use this fact to derive some interesting consequences regarding the geometry of the set of singular matrices. In particular, we show that the set of singular matrices is a union of Zariski closed subsets of strictly smaller dimension. This provides a new perspective on the geometry of matrix singularities, and opens up new avenues for research.

Finally, we apply our results to the study of certain special classes of algebraic varieties, known as Schubert varieties. We show that the ideal of a Schubert variety is unmixed, and hence Cohen-Macaulay. This allows us to compute the Hilbert series of Schubert varieties in terms of certain combinatorial data, known as Schubert polynomials. We also derive some interesting consequences regarding the cohomology of Schubert varieties, showing that it can be expressed in terms of the cohomology of certain Schubert cells.

In summary, this paper provides a detailed study of pure differential modules and their relationship to unmixed polynomial ideals. Using a result of Macaulay, we show that certain classes of pure differential modules are closely related to the Cohen-Macaulay property. We then apply these results to the study of the geometry of singular matrices and the cohomology of Schubert varieties. This work provides a valuable contribution to the theory of algebraic geometry and opens up new avenues for research.","(399, 19)","The first purpose of this paper is to point out a curious result announced by 19th-century mathematician Francis Sowerby Macaulay in his work on unmixed polynomial ideals.

In this paper, we aim to provide a modern interpretation of Macaulay's result using the language of pure differential modules.

To achieve this goal, we begin by recalling the definition of a pure differential module. A differential module over a ring R is a pair (M, ∂) consisting of an R-module M and a derivation ∂: M → M such that ∂(ab) = a∂(b) + b∂(a) for all a, b in R. The module M is said to be pure if it has no torsion elements, meaning that for any r in R and m in M, if rm = 0, then either r = 0 or m = 0. We also recall the definition of an unmixed ideal, which is an ideal I in R such that for any prime ideal P containing I, the height of P is equal to the height of I.

With these definitions in mind, we proceed to establish a connection between pure differential modules and unmixed ideals. Specifically, we show that if I is an unmixed ideal of height h in R, then there exist pure differential modules M1, M2,..., Mn over R such that each Mi has height h and the annihilator of each Mi is equal to a power of I. Furthermore, we show that the direct sum of the Mi's is a pure differential module whose annihilator is equal to I.

To prove this result, we use a combination of techniques from commutative algebra and homological algebra. Specifically, we use the theory of syzygies and the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula to establish the existence of the pure differential modules Mi. We also use the theory of derived functors to compute the cohomology of the Mi's and show that their annihilators are equal to powers of I.

One of the main implications of our result is that it provides a new perspective on Macaulay's theorem.

Context: Compilation time is an important factor in the adaptability of a software project. Fast ","Context: Compilation time is an important factor in the adaptability of a software project. Fast recompilation enables cheap experimentation with changes to a project, as those changes can be tested quickly. Separate and incremental compilation has been a topic of interest for a long time to facilitate fast recompilation.

Inquiry: Despite the benefits of an incremental compiler, such compilers are usually not the default. This is because incrementalization requires cross-cutting, complicated, and error-prone techniques such as dependency tracking, caching, cache invalidation, and change detection. Especially in compilers for languages with cross-module definitions and integration, correctly and efficiently implementing an incremental compiler can be a challenge. Retrofitting incrementality into a compiler is even harder. We address this problem by developing a compiler design approach that reuses parts of an existing non-incremental compiler to lower the cost of building an incremental compiler. It also gives an intuition into compiling difficult-to-incrementalize language features through staging.

Approach: We use the compiler design approach presented in this paper to develop an incremental compiler for the Stratego term-rewriting language. This language has a set of features that at first glance look incompatible with incremental compilation. Therefore, we treat Stratego as our critical case to demonstrate the approach on. We show how this approach decomposes the original compiler and has a solution to compile Stratego incrementally. The key idea on which we build our incremental compiler is to internally use an incremental build system to wire together the components we extract from the original compiler.

Knowledge: The resulting compiler is already in use as a replacement of the original whole-program compiler. We find that the incremental build system inside the compiler is a crucial component of our approach. This allows a compiler writer to think in multiple steps of compilation, and combine that into a incremental compiler almost effortlessly. Normally, separate compilation \`a la C is facilitated by an external build system, where the programmer is responsible for managing dependencies between files. We reuse an existing sound and optimal incremental build system, and integrate its dependency tracking into the compiler.

Grounding: The incremental compiler for Stratego is available as an artefact along with this article. We evaluate it on a large Stratego project to test its performance. The benchmark replays edits to the Stratego project from version control. These benchmarks are part of the artefact, packaged as a virtual machine image for easy reproducibility.

Importance: Although we demonstrate our design approach on the Stratego programming language, we also describe it generally throughout this paper. Many currently used programming languages have a compiler that is much slower than necessary. Our design provides an approach to change this, by reusing an existing compiler and making it incremental within a reasonable amount of time.","(504, 26)","With the increasing complexity of software systems, extensibility has become a key concern for developers. Hybrid incremental compilers are attractive for cross-module extensibility because they allow one to modify parts of the system without having to rebuild the entire application. However, the construction of a hybrid incremental compiler can be challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining consistency across modules. 

In this research paper, we propose a method for constructing hybrid incremental compilers that is designed to facilitate cross-module extensibility. Our method relies on an internal build system that separates compilation units into two categories: ""stable"" and ""unstable"". Stable modules can be compiled incrementally, while unstable modules are recompiled every time they are modified. The overall goal of this system is to minimize recompilation time, while ensuring consistent build artifacts across modules.

To evaluate our approach, we performed a case study in which we developed an extensible compiler for a subset of the Java programming language. We found that our method significantly reduced build times, and made it easier to add new language features. We also identified some limitations of our approach, such as the need for manual tuning of unstable modules and the potential for conflicts between different versions of stable modules.

Overall, our research provides a novel approach to constructing hybrid incremental compilers for cross-module extensibility. By utilizing an internal build system and carefully managing compilation units, we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce recompilation times and facilitate the addition of new features to complex software systems. Our work provides a starting point for further exploration of this topic, and we hope that other researchers will build on our approach to improve the extensibility of software systems.","(309, 13)","Context: Compilation time is an important factor in the adaptability of a software project. Fast  compilation times allow developers to quickly test and iterate on their code, while slow compilation times can hinder productivity and lead to frustration.

Problem Statement: Traditional compilers are designed to compile entire projects at once, resulting in long compilation times for large projects. Furthermore, these compilers often lack extensibility, making it difficult to integrate new features or tools into the compilation process.

Research Question: Can we design a hybrid incremental compiler that leverages an internal build system to provide fast compilation times and cross-module extensibility?

Methodology: To address this research question, we propose a novel approach to compiler design that combines the benefits of incremental compilation with the flexibility of an internal build system. Our approach, which we call ""Hybrid Incremental Compilation"" (HIC), consists of two main components:

1.  **Incremental Compiler**: This component is responsible for compiling individual modules or files within a project. It uses a combination of static analysis and dynamic recompilation to minimize the amount of code that needs to be recompiled after changes are made.
2.  **Internal Build System**: This component manages the compilation process, determining which modules need to be recompiled and when. It uses a graph-based representation of the project's dependencies to optimize the compilation order and minimize the number of recompilations required.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we implemented a prototype of the HIC system and applied it to several real-world projects. We measured the compilation times and compared them to those obtained using traditional compilers.

Findings: Our results show that the HIC system significantly reduces compilation times compared to traditional compilers. On average, the HIC system compiles projects 2-3 times faster than traditional compilers, with some projects experiencing compilation times that are up to 10 times faster. We also found that the internal build system is able to adapt to changes in the project structure and dependencies, ensuring that the compilation process remains efficient even as the project evolves.

Implications: The HIC system has several implications for software development. Firstly, it provides developers with fast compilation times, allowing them to work more efficiently and effectively. Secondly, it offers a high degree of extensibility, enabling developers to integrate new tools and features into the compilation process without modifying the underlying compiler. Finally, the internal build system provides a flexible and adaptable framework for managing project dependencies, making it easier to manage complex projects with many interdependent components.

Let $b$ be a $BMO$-function. It is well-known that the linear commutator $[b, T]$ of ","Let $b$ be a $BMO$-function. It is well-known that the linear commutator $[b, T]$ of a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator $T$ does not, in general, map continuously $H^1(\mathbb R^n)$ into $L^1(\mathbb R^n)$. However, P\'erez showed that if $H^1(\mathbb R^n)$ is replaced by a suitable atomic subspace $\mathcal H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ then the commutator is continuous from $\mathcal H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ into $L^1(\mathbb R^n)$. In this paper, we find the largest subspace $H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ such that all commutators of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators are continuous from $H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ into $L^1(\mathbb R^n)$.

Some equivalent characterizations of $H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ are also given. We also study the commutators $[b,T]$ for $T$ in a class $\mathcal K$ of sublinear operators containing almost all important operators in harmonic analysis. When $T$ is linear, we prove that there exists a bilinear operators $\mathfrak R= \mathfrak R_T$ mapping continuously $H^1(\mathbb R^n)\times BMO(\mathbb R^n)$ into $L^1(\mathbb R^n)$ such that for all $(f,b)\in H^1(\mathbb R^n)\times BMO(\mathbb R^n)$, we have \label{abstract 1} [b,T](f)= \mathfrak R(f,b) + T(\mathfrak S(f,b)), where $\mathfrak S$ is a bounded bilinear operator from $H^1(\mathbb R^n)\times BMO(\mathbb R^n)$ into $L^1(\mathbb R^n)$ which does not depend on $T$. In the particular case of $T$ a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator satisfying $T1=T^*1=0$ and $b$ in $BMO^{\rm log}(\mathbb R^n)$-- the generalized $\BMO$ type space that has been introduced by Nakai and Yabuta to characterize multipliers of $\BMO(\bR^n)$ --we prove that the commutator $[b,T]$ maps continuously $H^1_b(\mathbb R^n)$ into $h^1(\mathbb R^n)$. Also, if $b$ is in $BMO(\mathbb R^n)$ and $T^*1 = T^*b = 0$, then the commutator $[b, T]$ maps continuously $H^1_b (\mathbb R^n)$ into $H^1(\mathbb R^n)$. When $T$ is sublinear, we prove that there exists a bounded subbilinear operator $\mathfrak R= \mathfrak R_T: H^1(\mathbb R^n)\times BMO(\mathbb R^n)\to L^1(\mathbb R^n)$ such that for all $(f,b)\in H^1(\mathbb R^n)\times BMO(\mathbb R^n)$, we have \label{abstract 2} |T(\mathfrak S(f,b))|- \mathfrak R(f,b)\leq |[b,T](f)|\leq \mathfrak R(f,b) + |T(\mathfrak S(f,b))|.

Singular integrals are essential tools in the study of partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. In particular, they are used to establish the regularity and decay properties of solutions to these equations. However, in some cases, the study of singular integrals can be quite challenging due to their complicated structure. Bilinear decompositions and commutators provide a powerful tool to overcome these difficulties.

We begin by introducing the concept of singular integrals and their basic properties. We then focus on the bilinear decomposition of singular integrals, which decomposes them into simpler terms that are easier to analyze. We discuss different methods for constructing bilinear decompositions, including the Riesz transform method and the Littlewood-Paley method.

We then turn our attention to commutators, which are a useful tool for studying the boundedness and compactness of singular integral operators. Commutators are defined as the difference between a singular integral operator and a related operator. We explore the theory of commutators and present some of the key results in the field. In particular, we discuss the boundedness and compactness of commutators on different function spaces.

We also investigate the relationship between bilinear decompositions and commutators. We show that bilinear decompositions can be used to establish the boundedness and compactness of commutators. We present some examples that illustrate this relationship and discuss the advantages of using bilinear decompositions to study commutators.

Finally, we apply our results to the study of specific singular integral operators, including the Hilbert transform and the Calderón-Zygmund operators. We provide detailed analysis of these operators using bilinear decompositions and commutators, and demonstrate the power of these techniques in solving difficult problems in harmonic analysis.

Recovery of oil from oil shales and the natural primary migration of hydrocarbons are closely ","Recovery of oil from oil shales and the natural primary migration of hydrocarbons are closely related processes that have received renewed interests in recent years because of the ever tightening supply of conventional hydrocarbons and the growing production of hydrocarbons from low permeability tight rocks. Quantitative models for conversion of kerogen into oil and gas and the timing of hydrocarbon generation have been well documented. However, lack of consensus about the kinetics of hydrocarbon formation in source rocks, expulsion timing and how the resulting hydrocarbons escape from or are retained in the source rocks motivates further investigation. In particular, many mechanisms for the transport of hydrocarbons from the source rocks in which they are generated into adjacent rocks with higher permeabilities and smaller capillary entry pressures have been proposed, and a better understanding of this complex process (primary migration) is needed. To characterize these processes it is imperative to use the latest technological advances. In this study, it is shown how insights into hydrocarbon migration in source rocks can be obtained by using sequential high resolution synchrotron X-ray tomography.

Three-dimensional (3D) images of several immature ""shale"" samples were constructed at resolutions close to 5 micrometers. This is sufficient to resolve the source rock structure down to the grain level, but very fine grained silt particles, clay particles and colloids cannot be resolved. Samples used in this investigation came from the R-8 unit in the upper part of the Green River Shale, which is organic rich, varved, lacustrine marl formed in Eocene Lake Uinta, United States of America. One Green River Shale sample was heated in-situ up to 400{\deg}C as X-ray tomography images were recorded. The other samples were scanned before and after heating at 400{\deg}C. During the heating phase, the organic matter was decomposed, and gas was released. Gas expulsion from the low permeability shales was coupled with formation of microcracks. The main technical difficulty was numerical extraction of microcracks that have apertures in the 5 to 30 micrometer range (with 5 micrometers being the resolution limit) from a large 3D volume of X-ray attenuation data. The main goal of the work presented here is to develop a methodology to process these 3D data and image the cracks. This methodology is based on several levels of spatial filtering and automatic recognition of connected domains. Supportive petrographic and thermogravimetric data were an important complement to this study. An investigation of the strain field using two-dimensional image correlation analyses was also performed. As one application of the four-dimensional (4D, space + time) microtomography and the developed workflow, we show that fluid generation was accompanied by crack formation. Under different conditions, in the subsurface, this might provide paths for primary migration.","(503, 19)","This study employs 4D synchrotron X-ray tomography to investigate the formation of hydrocarbon migration pathways in heated organic-rich shale. The study uses in-situ observations of the shale samples under progressively increasing temperatures and pressures to track the evolution of porosity, permeability, and channels for fluid flow. 

The results show that heating the organic-rich shale to temperatures above 200°C leads to significant changes in the shale's lithology, with increased cracking and porosity resulting from deformation and stress on the mineral matrix. The observations further suggest that at above 250°C, the formerly continuous organic-rich layer undergoes significant thermal decomposition into various hydrocarbons. 

The X-ray results reveal the formation of hydrocarbon migration pathways above 300°C, with the networks of channels and micropores forming a hierarchical structure within the shale. These pathways subsequently facilitate fluid flow, with the highest permeability zones emerging inside the shale's organic-rich layer. The observed channels and permeability have a profound impact on petroleum recovery, and the data collected here can inform development of hydrocarbon resources in shale reservoirs.

The study of heated organic-rich shale at nanoscale resolution under in-situ conditions allowed identification of the various mechanisms that govern hydrocarbon migration in shale rocks. This was made possible by the combination of high-resolution 4D synchrotron X-ray tomography and the in-situ environmental reaction cell that provided the necessary environment for studying the evolution and behavior of shale samples under progressively increasing temperatures.

The samples were then imaged using 4D SXT, which enabled us to capture high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) images of the sample's internal structure at multiple time points during the heating process.

The SXT data were analyzed using a combination of image processing and machine learning algorithms to extract quantitative information on the evolution of porosity, permeability, and hydrocarbon saturation within the samples. Our results showed that the application of heat led to a significant increase in porosity and permeability, accompanied by the formation of complex network-like structures within the shale matrix. These structures, which we refer to as ""migration pathways,"" were found to be highly anisotropic, with preferential orientations aligned with the direction of heat flow.

The formation of migration pathways was found to be a nonlinear process, with an initial lag phase followed by a rapid increase in pathway density and complexity.

Reaction-diffusion analytical modeling of predator-prey systems has shown that specialist natural enemies can slow, stop ","Reaction-diffusion analytical modeling of predator-prey systems has shown that specialist natural enemies can slow, stop and even reverse pest invasions, assuming that the prey population displays a strong Allee effect in its growth.

Few additional analytical results have been obtained for other spatially distributed predator-prey systems, as traveling waves of non-monotonous systems are notoriously difficult to obtain. Traveling waves have indeed recently been shown to exist in predator-prey systems, but the direction of the wave, an essential item of information in the context of the control of biological invasions, is generally unknown. Preliminary numerical explorations have hinted that control by generalist predators might be possible for prey populations displaying logistic growth. We aimed to formalize the conditions in which spatial biological control can be achieved by generalists, through an analytical approach based on reaction-diffusion equations. The population of the focal prey - the invader - is assumed to grow according to a logistic function. The predator has a type II functional response and is present everywhere in the domain, at its carrying capacity, on alternative hosts.

Control, defined as the invader becoming extinct in the domain, may result from spatially independent demographic dynamics or from a spatial extinction wave.

Using comparison principles, we obtain sufficient conditions for control and for invasion, based on scalar bistable partial differential equations (PDEs).

The searching efficiency and functional response plateau of the predator are identified as the main parameters defining the parameter space for prey extinction and invasion. Numerical explorations are carried out in the region of those control parameters space between the super-and subso-lutions, in which no conclusion about controllability can be drawn on the basis of analytical solutions. The ability of generalist predators to control prey populations with logistic growth lies in the bis-table dynamics of the coupled system, rather than in the bistability of prey-only dynamics as observed for specialist predators attacking prey populations displaying Allee effects. The consideration of space in predator-prey systems involving generalist predators with a parabolic functional response is crucial. Analysis of the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) system identifies parameter regions with monostable (extinction) and bistable (extinction or invasion) dynamics. By contrast, analysis of the associated PDE system distinguishes different and additional regions of invasion and extinction. Depending on the relative positions of these different zones, four patterns of spatial dynamics can be identified : traveling waves of extinction and invasion, pulse waves of extinction and heterogeneous stationary positive solutions of the Turing type.

As a consequence, prey control is predicted to be possible when space is considered in additional situations other than those identified without considering space. The reverse situation is also possible. None of these considerations apply to spatial predator-prey systems with specialist natural enemies.","(496, 19)","This study focuses on the phenomenon of bistability that natural enemies can induce and its potential to reverse pest invasions. Generalist natural enemies, as opposed to specialist ones, are found to have the capacity to induce bistability by attacking both the pest population and alternative prey. The theoretical framework proposes that this essentially causes the system to have at least two stable states, meaning that if the population of the pest reaches a certain threshold, the system will flip from its equilibrium state to a new, stable equilibrium state in which the pest population is greatly reduced. A practical prediction of this is that an increase in the density of generalist enemies may initially result in an increase in pest density, which can then sharply decrease if the threshold is crossed.

In addition to bistability, the paper discusses the factors that can disrupt this mechanism and prevent it from functioning as expected. The authors identify several such factors, including spatial heterogeneity, density-dependent regulation, and the presence of other trophic levels. Spatial heterogeneity, for example, can reduce the effectiveness of generalists by making it harder for them to encounter the pests. Density-dependent regulation, on the other hand, can make it more difficult for the system to cross the threshold by stabilizing the pest population below the necessary threshold. Moreover, the presence of other trophic levels can lead to complex dynamics by introducing additional ecological interactions into the system.

The paper also explores the effects of different types of generalist natural enemies and how they interact with other factors in the system. For example, the authors compare the effects of parasitoids and predators on pest invasions and find that the former are generally more effective at inducing bistability. They also investigate the effects of alternative prey, which can both add to the generalist's diet and potentially stabilize the pest population by providing an alternative food source.

Overall, the paper presents a theoretical framework for bistability in pest-invader systems and identifies several important factors that can influence its functioning. It also provides practical predictions and insights for pest management strategies, such as the potential use of generalist natural enemies as biological control agents. However, the paper also emphasizes the importance of understanding the limitations and potential disruptions of this mechanism, as well as the need for further empirical studies to validate the theoretical predictions and improve our understanding of these complex ecological systems.","(437, 15)","Reaction-diffusion analytical modeling of predator-prey systems has shown that specialist natural enemies can slow, stop  or even reverse pest invasions. However, the role of generalist natural enemies in these systems remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the potential for generalist natural enemies to induce bistability in predator-prey systems, leading to the reversal of pest invasions. Bistability refers to the coexistence of multiple stable states in a system, where small changes in initial conditions or parameters can lead to drastically different outcomes.

To address this research question, we developed a mathematical model of a predator-prey system with a generalist natural enemy. The model incorporates the effects of predation on both the pest and the natural enemy, as well as the impact of the natural enemy on the pest's population growth rate. We used numerical simulations to explore the parameter space of the model and identify regions where bistability occurs. Specifically, we examined the effects of varying the natural enemy's attack rate, handling time, and prey preference on the emergence of bistability.

Our results show that bistability can indeed occur in predator-prey models with generalist natural enemies. In particular, we found that when the natural enemy has a high attack rate and low handling time, bistability is more likely to emerge. Furthermore, we observed that the natural enemy's prey preference plays a crucial role in determining the stability of the system. When the natural enemy preferentially attacks the pest, bistability is less likely to occur, whereas when it attacks both the pest and itself, bistability becomes more pronounced.

We also investigated the conditions under which bistability can lead to the reversal of pests invasions. Our results suggest that bistability can act as a ""switch"" that allows the system to transition from a state of pest dominance to a state of natural enemy dominance. This transition is facilitated by the natural enemy's ability to regulate its own population growth rate in response to changes in the pest population.

The implications of our findings are far-reaching. First, they suggest that generalist natural enemies may play a more significant role in regulating pest populations than previously thought. Second, they highlight the potential for bistability to act as a mechanism for reversing pest invasions, which could have important implications for pest management strategies. Finally, our results underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between predators, prey, and natural enemies in ecological systems.

Aims. The comparative study of several molecular species at the origin of the gas phase ","Aims. The comparative study of several molecular species at the origin of the gas phase chemistry in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) is a key input in unraveling the coupled chemical and dynamical evolution of the ISM. Methods.

The lowest rotational lines of HCO+, HCN, HNC, and CN were observed at the IRAM-30m telescope in absorption against the \lambda 3 mm and \lambda 1.3 mm continuum emission of massive star-forming regions in the Galactic plane. The absorption lines probe the gas over kiloparsecs along these lines of sight. The excitation temperatures of HCO+ are inferred from the comparison of the absorptions in the two lowest transitions. The spectra of all molecular species on the same line of sight are decomposed into Gaussian velocity components.

Most appear in all the spectra of a given line of sight. For each component, we derived the central opacity, the velocity dispersion, and computed the molecular column density. We compared our results to the predictions of UV-dominated chemical models of photodissociation regions (PDR models) and to those of non-equilibrium models in which the chemistry is driven by the dissipation of turbulent energy (TDR models). Results. The molecular column densities of all the velocity components span up to two orders of magnitude.

Those of CN, HCN, and HNC are linearly correlated with each other with mean ratios N(HCN)/N(HNC) = 4.8 $\pm$ 1.3 and N(CN)/N(HNC) = 34 $\pm$ 12, and more loosely correlated with those of HCO+, N(HNC)/N(HCO+) = 0.5 $\pm$ 0.3, N(HCN)/N(HCO+) = 1.9 $\pm$ 0.9, and N(CN)/N(HCO+) = 18 $\pm$ 9. These ratios are similar to those inferred from observations of high Galactic latitude lines of sight, suggesting that the gas sampled by absorption lines in the Galactic plane has the same chemical properties as that in the Solar neighbourhood. The FWHM of the Gaussian velocity components span the range 0.3 to 3 km s-1 and those of the HCO+ lines are found to be 30% broader than those of CN-bearing molecules. The PDR models fail to reproduce simultaneously the observed abundances of the CN-bearing species and HCO+, even for high-density material (100 cm-3 < nH < 104 cm-3). The TDR models, in turn, are able to reproduce the observed abundances and abundance ratios of all the analysed molecules for the moderate gas densities (30 cm-3 < nH < 200 cm-3) and the turbulent energy observed in the diffuse interstellar medium. Conclusions. Intermittent turbulent dissipation appears to be a promising driver of the gas phase chemistry of the diffuse and translucent gas throughout the Galaxy. The details of the dissipation mechanisms still need to be investigated.","(523, 20)","This study presents a comparative investigation of four molecular absorption lines that stem from star-forming regions, namely HCO+, HNC, HCN, and CN. Using the ASAI Interferometer located at the Frontera del Universo observatory in Mexico, we have observed and analyzed the cloud complexes around several millimeter continuum sources. The study aims to investigate the chemical variations across different star-forming regions and identify the dominant chemical processes involved in the formation of these molecules.

Our results indicate that while the column densities of HCO+ and HCN are generally correlated, their ratios to the column densities of HNC and CN show significant variations across the observed clouds. Moreover, the Column density ratio of HCO+ to HCN is found to be higher toward star-forming regions with more massive and evolved stars, which suggests that the dominant chemical processes vary as a function of the star-forming environment.

We have also compared our data with recent observations of related molecules from the ASAI Interferometer and found that some of the observed variations can be attributed to the evolution of the source objects themselves. Furthermore, the column densities and line-of-sight velocities of the observed molecules appear to correlate with the physical parameters of the regions where they are found, such as the temperature and density of the surrounding gas.

To interpret our results, we have used a simple chemical model to simulate the evolution of a molecular cloud in the presence of a protostellar source. The model is consistent with some of the observed trends, showing that the relative abundances of the observed molecules vary as a function of the evolutionary state of the cloud and the molecular feedback from the protostar.

Overall, our study provides new insights into the chemical processes involved in star formation and highlights the importance of spectroscopic observations in determining the physical and chemical properties of these regions. Moreover, it suggests that the observed variations in the molecular absorption lines toward star-forming regions can be used as important probes of their underlying chemical and physical conditions.","(360, 11)","Aims. The comparative study of several molecular species at the origin of the gas phase ices in star-forming regions (SFRs) is crucial for understanding the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM).

Our goal is to investigate the relative abundance and excitation conditions of these species in various SFRs, shedding light on their role in the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs).

Methodology. We conducted a systematic survey of molecular absorption lines toward a sample of 15 SFRs, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). We observed the 4-3 and 3-2 transitions of HCO+, the 5-4 and 4-3 transitions of HNC, the 9-8 and 8-7 transitions of HCN, and the 3-2 and 2-1 transitions of CN. The data were reduced using the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package, and the spectral lines were analyzed using the Spectral Line Analysis Package (SLAP). We employed the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) model to estimate the column densities and excitation temperatures of the observed species.

Findings. Our results show that the relative abundance of the four species varies significantly across the sample of SFRs. HCO+ is found to be the most abundant species, with column densities ranging from 10^12 to 10^14 cm^-2.

X-ray spectroscopy and coincidences experiment are planned. A prototype with a single HADP crystal with von Hamos geometry has been tested (resolution and efficiency). A fast time and position detector has been realized (patent and publication).We plan to build the spectrometer with 8 HADP (or 4) crystals under Helium atmosphere using a TimePix3 or a CCD camera. MOSARIX is a project of an x-ray spectrometer in the tender x-ray domain (2-5 keV) with high efficiency, allowing performing x-ray emission and coincidences (or covariance mapping) experiments using synchrotron radiation, XFEL, the future installation SPIRAL2/GANIL or CRYRING/FAIR. It involves 2 groups at LCPMR (Francis PENENT and Marc SIMON) and one group at INSP (Dominique VERNHET). The coincidences/covariance measurements will be between x-ray photons and ions or electrons. It would be the first time for such coincidences with energy-resolved photons. The spectrometer will be portable and will be brought to the different large-scale facilities. MOSARIX is a multi-crystal HAPG von Hamos spectrometer optimized for the 2-5 keV photon energy range. Its resolving power E/DE will be 4000. It will be equipped with a fast time and position sensitive detection system, allowing performing coincidences, or with a CCD camera. I. Scientific case and some possible experiments The accelerated development of x-ray sources, as 3 rd generation synchrotrons (and recent upgrades) or free-electron lasers, has opened new opportunities to investigate new phenomena by means of photoelectron and Auger spectroscopy, electron-ion coincidence techniques and x-ray emission. However, several processes of high scientific interests are still hard to measure; some of them require the measurement of photons with high efficiency, high resolution and even sometimes in coincidence mode. This is the purpose of MOSARIX development. As an example, we propose to revisit Resonance-Enhanced X-ray Multiple Ionization (REXMI) 1 with a significant amelioration of the detection of photons, i.e. measuring the photons not only with high efficiency and high resolution but also in coincidence with ions or electrons. This will allow accessing the involved intermediate states and obtaining a clearer image of the dynamic of the multiple ionization process. MOSARIX can also be used for the investigation of very low cross-section phenomena such as attosecond electron dynamics 2 and High-Energy Resolution Off-Resonant Spectroscopy (HEROS) 3,4. X-ray spectroscopy has also proved to be a very powerful tool to investigate quantum dynamics in heavy ions collisions with matter of whatever nature, dilute or condensed 5-7. A","(484, 22)","This progress report provides an overview of advancements and outcomes in the development of the MOSARIX system, a revolutionary technology designed for intelligent and autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

The MOSARIX project aims at enabling UAVs to perform multiple tasks, such as aerial surveillance, search and rescue missions, and environmental monitoring, without direct human intervention. Despite the challenges posed by the complex algorithms and machine learning techniques required, this ambitious goal has been successfully achieved for some tasks.

Among the key advancements highlighted in this progress report, we present the improvements in the system's sensing abilities, which enable it to estimate its position and orientation with greater accuracy, and the enhanced perception of the environment, which allows it to recognize objects and obstacles in real-time.

Another noteworthy aspect of the MOSARIX system is its adaptability to different environments and situations, whether it be navigating through a forest, tracking a vehicle on a highway, or inspecting a power grid. The adaptability is made possible by the integration of multiple sensors and a modular software architecture.

Additionally, the report presents experimental results demonstrating the system's effectiveness when used in real-world scenarios. For instance, during a forest monitoring mission, MOSARIX was able to detect anomalies and changes in the vegetation, monitor the temperature, and identify potential risks such as forest fires. Similarly, during an urban search and rescue operation, the system successfully navigated through a simulated disaster zone to find survivors, while avoiding obstacles and hazards.

Finally, the report highlights some of the challenges and limitations of the MOSARIX system, including the need for further improvements in the system's algorithms to handle more complex tasks and scenarios, and the need for more robust and reliable communication systems to ensure seamless integration with other platforms.

One of the key findings of our study was the importance of user-centered design in the development of assistive technologies. Our participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the exoskeleton, citing its comfort, ease of use, and ability to enhance their independence. However, they also identified several areas for improvement, including the need for more intuitive control systems and greater customization options.

The implications of our research are significant, with potential applications in a range of fields, including rehabilitation medicine, physical therapy, and assistive technology. The MOSARIK exoskeleton has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach mobility assistance, providing individuals with greater autonomy and independence. Furthermore, our research highlights the importance of collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches in the development of innovative technologies.

Future directions for the MOSARIX project include further testing and refinement of the exoskeleton's control system, as well as the development of new features and functionalities.

Context. Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced by the explosions of massive stars that ","Context. Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced by the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN explosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been observed before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as SN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still unclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the existence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with superwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN progenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on the nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments, in particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain metallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn, SNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values from the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity distributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other core-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between metallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs tend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.

Among SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to those of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower metallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe IIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs (that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe IIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized Cumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II regions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities at higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during SN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM quiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in metallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the progenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly arising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds likely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors, metallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these transients. Key words. supernovae: general - stars: evolution - galaxies: abundances","(513, 26)","This research paper explores the relationship between the metallicity of interacting transients and the explosion sites. Metallicity is a term used to describe the proportion of elements in a given object that are not hydrogen or helium. In this study, we investigate how metallicity affects the behavior of interacting transients, specifically in regards to their explosion sites.

To conduct this study, we first collected data on interacting transients from a variety of sources. We then analyzed this data using statistical methods to determine the relationship between metallicity and explosion sites. Our results show that there is a significant correlation between higher metallicity and explosion sites that are more centrally located.

We also found that there is an inverse relationship between metallicity and the distance between explosion sites and the centers of interacting transients. This suggests that transients with lower metallicity may be more likely to have explosion sites that are further away from their center of mass.

Overall, our findings suggest that metallicity plays an important role in determining the location of explosion sites in interacting transients. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms behind this relationship and to determine whether other factors, such as the mass of the interacting transients, also play a role in determining explosion site location.

These results have implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. By studying the metallicity of interacting transients and their explosion sites, we can gain insights into the chemical composition of these objects and the physical processes that govern their behavior. Additionally, our findings may have practical applications in fields such as astrophysics and astronomy, where a deeper understanding of the behavior and characteristics of interacting transients is of great importance.

In conclusion, this research paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of astrophysics by highlighting the important role of metallicity in determining the location of explosion sites in interacting transients. By further investigating this relationship, we can gain greater insights into the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies, and advance our understanding of the physical processes that underlie the behavior of these objects.","(379, 15)","Context. Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced by the explosions of massive stars that  interact with their surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM). The interaction between the SN ejecta and the CSM can significantly affect the observed properties of the SN, including its light curve, spectra, and metallicity. However, the metallicity at the explosion site of CSI SNe remains poorly understood due to the complex interplay between the SN progenitor, the CSM, and the explosion mechanism.

Research Question. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the metallicity of the explosion site and the properties of CSI SNe. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions: (1) What is the metallicity distribution of CSI SNe, and how does it compare to that of non-interacting SNe? (2) Are there any correlations between metallicity and SN properties, such as luminosity, color, and spectral features? (3) Can metallicity be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between different types of CSI SNe?

Methodology. We compiled a sample of 50 CSI SNe from the literature, including both Type II and Type Ib/c SNe. We used spectroscopic and photometric data to determine the metallicity of each SN at the explosion site. We employed a combination of empirical and theoretical methods to estimate the metallicity, including the use of strong-line indices, nebular emission lines, and photoionization models. We also analyzed the SN light curves and spectra to identify correlations with metallicity.

Findings. Our analysis reveals a bimodal distribution of metallicity among CSI SNe, with a median metallicity of -0.5 dex.

Some implants have approximately a lifetime of 15 years. The femoral stem, for example, should ","Some implants have approximately a lifetime of 15 years. The femoral stem, for example, should be made of 316L/316LN stainless steel. Fretting corrosion, friction under small displacements, should occur during human gait, due to repeated loadings and un-loadings, between stainless steel and bone for instance. Some experimental investigations of fretting corrosion have been practiced. As well known, metallic alloys and especially stainless steels are covered with a passive film that prevents from the corrosion and degradation.

This passive layer of few nanometers, at ambient temperature, is the key of our civilization according to some authors. This work is dedicated to predict the passive layer thicknesses of stainless steel under fretting corrosion with a specific emphasis on the role of proteins. The model is based on the Point Defect Model (micro scale) and an update of the model on the friction process (micro-macro scale). Genetic algorithm was used for finding solution of the problem. The major results are, as expected from experimental results, albumin prevents from degradation at the lowest concentration of chlorides; an incubation time is necessary for degrading the passive film; under fretting corrosion and high concentration of chlorides the passive behavior is annihilated.

Les implants orthop\'ediques de hanche ont une dur\'ee de vie d'environ 15 ans. Par exemple, la tige f\'emorale d'un tel implant peut \^etre r\'ealis\'ee en acier inoxydable 316L ou 316LN. Le fretting corrosion, frottement sous petits d\'eplacements, peut se produire pendant la marche humaine en raison des chargements r\'ep\'et\'es entre le m\'etal de la proth\`ese et l'os. Plusieurs investigations exp\'erimentales du fretting corrosion ont \'et\'e entreprises.

Cette couche passive de quelques nanom\`etres, \`a temp\'erature ambiante, est le point clef sur lequel repose le d\'eveloppement de notre civilisation, selon certains auteurs. Ce travail vise \`a pr\'edire les \'epaisseurs de cette couche passive de l'acier inoxydable soumis au fretting corrosion, avec une attention sp\'ecifique sur le r\^ole des prot\'eines. Le mod\`ele utilis\'e est bas\'e sur le Point Defect Model, PDM (\`a une \'echelle microscopique) et une am\'elioration de ce mod\`ele en prenant en compte le processus de frottement sous petits d\'ebattements. L'algorithme g\'en\'etique a \'et\'e utilis\'e pour optimiser la convergence du probl\`eme.

Fretting corrosion is a complex form of wear that occurs between two surfaces subjected to oscillatory movements. The formation and growth of passive films play a critical role in mitigating fretting corrosion. The success of passive films depends on their thickness, which needs to be optimized to achieve the best protection against corrosion.

To predict the steady-state thickness of passive films, the Point Defect Model is employed. This model allows for a description of the evolution of point defects in materials, which are known to play an essential role in passive film formation. The PDM provides a theoretical framework to understand the growth of passive films under fretting corrosion conditions. Using the PDM, it is possible to link the film thickness to the concentration of diffusing species, such as oxygen or chromium.

In this research work, experimental data from fretting corrosion tests were used to validate the PDM predictions. Three different materials were tested: stainless steel, Ti-6Al-4V alloy, and aluminum. The PDM results were compared to the experimental data, and a good agreement was found for all materials tested. The film thickness achieved a steady-state value after a certain time, which was also observed in experiments. The model was further used to investigate the effect of key parameters on the passive film growth, such as the frequency and amplitude of the fretting motion and the solution composition.

Overall, the Point Defect Model presented in this work has proven to be a powerful tool to predict the steady-state thickness of passive films in fretting corrosion experiments. The model provides a theoretical understanding of the mechanisms behind passive film formation and can be used to optimize the conditions for passive film growth and the resulting corrosion resistance. Future work could focus on extending the model to account for more complex corrosion scenarios or to study other materials and conditions in fretting corrosion experiments.","(367, 16)","Some implants have approximately a lifetime of 15 years. The femoral stem, for example, should  last at least 20 years. However, fretting corrosion can significantly reduce the lifespan of these implants. Fretting corrosion is a type of corrosion that occurs when two surfaces are in contact and move relative to each other. This movement can lead to the formation of a thin layer of corrosion products, known as a passive film, on the surface of the implant. The thickness of this passive film can have a significant impact on the lifespan of the implant.

The Point Defect Model (PDM) is a mathematical model that can be used to predict the steady-state thickness of passive films. The PDM is based on the idea that the growth of the passive film is controlled by the movement of point defects, such as vacancies and interstitials, through the film. The model takes into account several factors, including the concentration of point defects, the diffusion coefficient of the point defects, and the electrochemical potential of the metal.

In this study, we used a combination of experimental and computational methods to investigate the application of the PDM to fretting corrosion experiments. We conducted a series of fretting corrosion experiments using a titanium alloy, which is commonly used in orthopedic implants. The experiments involved subjecting the alloy to different levels of fretting stress and measuring the resulting passive film thickness.

We also developed a computational model based on the PDM, which was used to simulate the behavior of the passive film under different conditions. The model was validated against the experimental data and was found to be in good agreement with the measured passive film thickness.

Our results show that the PDM is a useful tool for predicting the steadystate thickness of passive films formed during fretting corrosion. The model was able to accurately predict the passive film thickness for a wide range of fretting stress levels. We also found that the PDM was able to capture the effects of different experimental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, on the passive film thickness.

The implications of our study are significant. The PDM can be used to optimize the design of implants to reduce the risk of fretting corrosion. For example, the model can be used to determine the optimal surface finish and material properties for an implant to minimize the formation of a passive film. Our study also highlights the importance of considering the effects of fretting corrosion on the lifespan of implants. By understanding the mechanisms of fretting corrosion and the role of the passive film, designers and engineers can develop more durable and long-lasting implants.

This work is a positioning research paper for energy efficient building based on ICT solutions. ","This work is a positioning research paper for energy efficient building based on ICT solutions. Through the literature about the solutions for energy control of buildings during operational phase, a 3-layers model is proposed to integrate these solutions: first level consists in communication technologies, second level is about data modelling and third level is related to decision-making tools. For each level, key research topics and remaining problems are identified in order to achieve a concrete step forward. 1. CONTEXT AND PROBLEMATICS Through studies on ICT solutions for energy control of buildings, a 3-layers model is proposed to integrate these solutions and position a new way for energy efficiency. The building sector is the largest user of energy and CO 2 emitter in the EU, estimated at approximately 40% of the total consumption (Sharples et al., 1999). According to the International Panel on Climate Change (European Union, 2010), 30% of energy used in buildings could be reduced with net economic benefits by 2030. Such a reduction, however, is meaningless unless ""sustainability"" is considered. Because of these factors, healthy, sustainable, and energy efficient buildings have become active topics in international research; there is an urgent need for a new kind of high-technology driven and integrative research that should lead to the massive development of smart buildings and, in the medium term, smart cities. From a building lifecycle perspective, most of the energy (~80%) is consumed during the operational stage of the building (European Union, 2010) (Bilsen et al., 2013). Reducing building energy consumption may be addressed by the physical modifications which can be operated on a building like upgrading windows, heating systems or modifying thermic characteristics by insulating. Another possible path to reduce the energy consumption of a building is to use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). According to the International Panel on Climate Change, a reduction of energy even greater than the 30% can be targeted by 2030 by considering ICT solutions. In support of this claim, some specialists believe that ICT-based solutions have the potential to enable 50-80% greenhouse gas reduction globally. In this respect, ICT innovation opens prospects for the development of a new range of new services highly available, flexible, safe, easy to integrate, and user friendly (Bilsen et al., 2013). This, in turn, should foster a sophisticated, reliable and fast communication infrastructure for the connection of various distributed elements (sensors, generators, substations...) that enables to exchange real-time data, information and knowledge needed to improve efficiency (e.g., to monitor and control energy consumption), reliability (e.g., to facilitate maintenance operations), flexibility (e.g., to integrate new rules to meet new consumer expectations), and investment returns, but also to induce a shift in consumer behaviour.","(532, 16)","The building sector is a significant contributor to global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, there has been growing interest in constructing energy-efficient buildings to reduce environmental impacts and also to save energy costs. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) play a vital role in achieving this goal. 

This paper aims to explore the potential of ICTs in making buildings more energy efficient. In particular, we investigate how advances in ICTs have contributed to improving building energy efficiency, and how they can further help in this direction. We begin with an overview of the current state-of-the-art in energy-efficient building design and technologies. Then, we discuss in detail the various ICT-based solutions which have been proposed and implemented with the aim of enhancing energy efficiency in buildings. 

One important area that ICTs can help is in building automation and control systems. These systems can monitor building performance in real-time, optimizing energy consumption and improving occupant comfort. Another area is the use of sensor technologies to collect data on building energy performance. This data can then be analyzed to identify areas where improvements can be made. Moreover, predictive analytics techniques can be employed to forecast energy needs and help optimize energy usage. 

Another promising area where ICTs can help is through the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM). BIM enables designers and engineers to simulate and analyze building performance at the design stage, allowing them to identify and rectify potential energy inefficiencies before construction. Furthermore, once a building is built, BIM can be used to monitor and maintain its performance throughout its lifecycle. 

However, the adoption of ICTs in the building sector faces several challenges, such as lack of interoperability between different systems and solutions, as well as insufficient awareness and understanding among building professionals. Therefore, this paper also discusses the various barriers which need to be overcome to successfully implement ICT-based solutions for energy-efficient buildings. This includes the need for standardization and regulation, as well as education and training of building professionals. 

In conclusion, this paper establishes that the use of ICTs can significantly contribute to achieving energy-efficient buildings.

CODYRUN is a multi-zone software integrating thermal building simulation, airflow, and pollutant transfer. A first ","CODYRUN is a multi-zone software integrating thermal building simulation, airflow, and pollutant transfer. A first question thus arose as to the integration of indoor lighting conditions into the simulation, leading to a new model calculating natural and artificial lighting. The results of this new daylighting module were then compared with results of other simulation codes and experimental cases both in artificial and natural environments. Excellent agreements were obtained, such as the values for luminous efficiencies in a tropical and humid climate. In this paper, a comparison of the model output with detailed measures is presented using a dedicated test cell in Reunion Island (French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean), thus confirming the interest for thermal and daylighting designs in low-energy buildings.

Introduction Several software packages are available for thermal and airflow simulation in buildings. The most frequently used are ENERGY+ [1], ESP-r [2], and TRNSYS [3]. These applications allow an increasing number of models to be integrated, such as airflow, pollutant transport, and daylighting. In the latter category, we may note ENERGY+, ESP-r and ECOTECT [4] software. After more than 20 years of developing a specific code named CODYRUN, we decided to add a lighting module to our software. This paper therefore provides some details on this evolution and elements of validation. The CODYRUN initial software and its validation Developed by the Physics and Mathematical Engineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment at the University of Reunion Island, CODYRUN [5-14] is a multi-zone software program integrating ventilation and moisture transport transfer in buildings. The software employs a zone approach based on nodal analysis and resolves a coupled system describing thermal and airflow phenomena. Numerous validation tests of the CODYRUN code were successfully applied to the software. Apart from the daylighting model, the majority applied the BESTEST procedure [15]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) sponsors a number of programs to improve the use and associated technologies of energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed BESTEST, which is a method based on comparative testing of building simulation programs, on the IEA's behalf. The procedure consists of a series of test cases buildings that are designed to isolate individual aspects of building energy and test the extremes of a program. As the modelling approach is very different between codes, the test cases are specified so that input equivalency can be defined thus allowing the different cases to be modelled by most of codes. The basis for comparison is a range of results from a number of programs considered to be a state-of-art in United States and Europe.

Associated with other specific comparisons, a very confident level of validation was obtained for the CODYRUN initial software [8].","(506, 21)","The application of energy-efficient and sustainable design principles is important for reducing carbon emissions and achieving environmental goals. One important factor that determines the energy efficiency of a building is its daylighting design, which optimizes natural light infiltration to achieve energy savings and improve occupant comfort. However, accurate modeling of daylighting in building simulations is challenging due to the complex interplay between various factors, such as window design, orientation, reflectance, and shading.

In this research, we present a validation study of a daylighting model implemented in the CODYRUN building simulation code. This model is based on the Radiance lighting simulation software, which is widely used in the lighting design industry and has been validated against other research studies. Our goal is to assess the accuracy and reliability of the CODYRUN model for simulating daylighting performance in a range of building types and climate conditions.

To achieve this goal, we conducted a series of validation tests using real-world building data and experimental measurements. We selected three different building prototypes representing a range of typologies and orientations, and we simulated their daylighting performance using the CODYRUN model and a standard Radiance model. We compared the results of the two simulations against measured data from on-site sensors and found that the CODYRUN model achieved a high degree of accuracy in predicting daylighting performance and illuminance levels.

Our results demonstrate that the CODYRUN model is a reliable and accurate tool for simulating daylighting performance in building design. This model can be used to optimize the design of new buildings for energy efficiency and occupant comfort, and to evaluate the retrofitting potential of existing buildings. Moreover, it can be used in conjunction with other building simulation codes to achieve a comprehensive analysis of building performance.

Overall, this research contributes to the validation of a tool that can improve the sustainability and energy efficiency of building design. Further research could focus on developing more advanced and detailed daylighting models for even more sophisticated building simulation analyses.","(357, 14)","CODYRUN is a multi-zone software integrating thermal building simulation, airflow, and pollutant transfer.

Distant clumpy galaxies are thought to be Jeans-unstable disks, and an important channel for the ","Distant clumpy galaxies are thought to be Jeans-unstable disks, and an important channel for the formation of local galaxies, as suggested by recent spatially-resolved kinematic observations of z~2 galaxies. I study the kinematics of clumpy galaxies at z~0.6, and compare their properties with those of counterparts at higher and lower redshifts. I selected a sample of 11 clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 from the representative sample of emission line, intermediate-mass galaxies IMAGES. Selection was based on rest-frame UV morphology from HST/ACS images, mimicking the selection criteria commonly used at higher redshifts. Their spatially-resolved kinematics were derived in the frame of the IMAGES survey, using the VLT/FLAMES-GIRAFFE multi-integral field spectrograph. For those showing large-scale rotation, I derived the Toomre Q parameter, which characterizes the stability of their gaseous and stellar phases. I find that the fraction of UV-selected clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 is 20+/-12%. Roughly half of them (45+/-30%) have complex kinematics inconsistent with Jeans-unstable disks, while those in the remaining half (55+/-30%) show large-scale rotations. The latter reveal a stable gaseous phase, but the contribution of their stellar phase makes them globally unstable to clump formation. Clumpy galaxies appear to be less unstable at z~0.6 than at z~2, which could explain why the UV clumps tend to vanish in rest-frame optical images of z~0.6 clumpy galaxies, conversely to z~2 clumpy galaxies, in which the stellar phase can substantially fragment. This suggests that the former correspond to patchy star-formation regions superimposed on a smoother mass distribution. A possible and widespread scenario for driving clump formation relies on instabilities by cold streams penetrating the dark matter halos where clumpy galaxies inhabit. While such a gas accretion process is predicted to be significant in massive, z~2 haloes, it is also predicted to be strongly suppressed in similar, z~0.6 haloes, which could explain why lowest-z clumpy galaxies appear to be driven by a different mechanism. Instead, I found that interactions are probably the dominant driver leading to the formation of clumpy galaxies at z<1. I argue that the nature of z>1 clumpy galaxies remains more uncertain. While cold flows could be an important driver at z~2, I also argue that the observed and cumulative merger fraction between z=2 and z=3 is large enough so that every z~2 galaxy might be the result of a merger that occurred within their past 1 Gyr. I conclude that it is premature to rule out mergers as a universal driver for galaxy evolution from z~2 down to z=0.","(456, 17)","This study examines the properties of clumpy galaxies at z~0.6, focusing on their kinematics, stability, and comparison with analogs at other redshifts. We select a sample of these galaxies using HST/COSMOS imaging and perform a detailed analysis of their internal dynamics using integral field spectroscopy. We find that clumpy galaxies have irregular velocity fields with significant deviations from circular motions, indicative of ongoing gas accretion and/or merger events. Our analysis of the Toomre stability parameter reveals that clumpy galaxies are marginally unstable against axisymmetric modes, with a median Q value of 1.6±0.2. However, when non-axisymmetric modes are taken into account, the stability criterion is more easily satisfied, suggesting that clumps play a crucial role in stabilizing the disks of these galaxies. We compare our results to existing studies of clumpy galaxies at different redshifts and find that kinematic properties and stability conditions of these systems evolve in a complex manner over time. While clumps in local galaxies are often associated with tidally induced star formation in bulge-dominated disks, at higher redshifts they are more commonly found in pure-disk galaxies that are in the process of assembling. Our findings provide further evidence for the importance of clumps in galaxy evolution and suggest that the kinematics and stability of these systems are key indicators of their formation histories. We discuss the implications of our results for galaxy formation and evolution models and highlight the need for more detailed studies of clumpy galaxies at a range of redshifts.

Aims. Excitation of far-infrared and submillimetric molecular lines may originate from nonreactive collisions, chemical formation, ","Aims. Excitation of far-infrared and submillimetric molecular lines may originate from nonreactive collisions, chemical formation, or far infrared, near-infrared, and optical fluorescences. As a template, we investigate the impact of each of these processes on the excitation of the methylidyne cation CH+ and on the intensities of its rotational transitions recently detected in emission in dense photodissociation regions (PDRs) and in planetary nebulae.

Methods. We have developed a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) excitation model that includes the entire energy structure of CH+, i.e. taking into account the pumping of its vibrational and bound and unbound electronic states by near-infrared and optical photons. The model includes the theoretical cross-sections of nonreactive collisions with H, H2, He, and e-, and a Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the probability of populating the excited levels of CH+ during its chemical formation by hydrogenation of C+. To confirm our results we also performed an extensive analytical study, which we use to predict the main excitation process of several diatomic molecules, namely HF, HCl, SiO, CS, and CO. Results. At densities nH = 10^4 cm-3, the excitation of the rotational levels of CH+ is dominated by the radiative pumping of its electronic, vibrational, and rotational states if the intensities of the radiation field at \sim 0.4, \sim 4, and \sim 300 \mum are stronger than 10^5, 10^8, and 10^4 times those of the local interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Below these values, the chemical pumping is the dominant source of excitation of the J > 1 levels, even at high kinetic temperatures (\sim 1000 K). The far-infrared emission lines of CH+ observed in the Orion Bar and the NGC 7027 PDRs are consistent with the predictions of our excitation model assuming an incident far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field of \sim 3 \times 10^4 (in Draine's unit) and densities of \sim 5 \times 10^4 and \sim 2 \times 10^5 cm-3. In the case of NGC 7027, the estimate of the density is 10 to 100 times lower than those deduced by traditional excitation codes.

Applying our model to other X1\Sigma+ ground state diatomic molecules, we find that HF, and SiO and HCl are the species the most sensitive to the radiative pumping of their vibrational and bound electronic states. In both cases, the minimal near-infrared and optical/UV radiation field intensities required to modify their rotational level populations are \sim 10^3 times those of the local ISRF at densities nH = 10^4 cm-3. All these results point towards interstellar and circumstellar media with densities lower than previously established and cast doubts on the clumpiness of well-studied molecular clouds.","(487, 16)","This research paper presents a complete model of the rotational excitation of CH+ that incorporates both radiative and chemical pumping processes. We investigate the physical mechanisms that govern the initial excitation and subsequent de-excitation of this molecule, as well as the role played by the external radiation field. Our model allows us to predict the rotational excitation of the CH+ molecule at different physical conditions and assess the impact of radiative and chemical processes on this excitation. 

We begin by describing the basic properties of CH+ and its spectral features. We then detail the calculation of the radiative and chemical rates that enter our model. The radiative pumping is a result of the interaction between CH+ and the background radiation field, while the chemical pumping arises from reactions of CH+ with other species. The balance between these two processes and their relative importance in different environments is investigated using our model.

Results from our simulations show that both radiative and chemical pumping contribute significantly to the rotational excitation of CH+ at different levels. The balance between these processes is found to depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and gas density, as well as the intensity and spectral distribution of the radiation field. We find that chemical pumping dominates in the low-density regime, while radiation pumping dominates in high-density environments. 

The implications of our study are significant for understanding a range of astrophysical phenomena, where CH+ plays an important role. For example, CH+ has been detected in a variety of interstellar environments, and its rotational excitation is critical for interpreting the observed emission. By providing a complete model that includes both radiative and chemical pumping processes, our study provides new insights into the excitation of CH+ and its role in astrophysical environments.

Overall, this work represents a significant advancement in our understanding of the rotational excitation of CH+ and its dependence on the radiative and chemical pumping processes.

Excitation of far-infrared and submillimetric molecular lines may originate from nonreactive collisions, chemical formation, ionic recombination, and radiative processes.

Background. CH+ is a key species in various astrophysical environments, such as star-forming regions, planetary nebulae, and cometary atmospheres.

Results. Our model predicts that radiative pumping dominates the rotational excitation of CH+ in optically thin environments, while chemical pumping becomes significant in denser regions. We found that the rotational temperature of CH+ is sensitive to the intensity and spectral distribution of the radiation field, as well as the abundance of reactants involved in chemical pumping. The model also reveals that the CH+ population is influenced by the presence of other species, such as H2 and CO, which participate in chemical reactions that affect the CH+ excitation.

Context: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) enable domain experts to specify tasks and problems themselves, while enabling ","Context: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) enable domain experts to specify tasks and problems themselves, while enabling static analysis to elucidate issues in the modelled domain early. Although language workbenches have simplified the design of DSLs and extensions to general purpose languages, static analyses must still be implemented manually.

Inquiry: Moreover, static analyses, e.g., complexity metrics, dependency analysis, and declaration-use analysis, are usually domain-dependent and cannot be easily reused. Therefore, transferring existing static analyses to another DSL incurs a huge implementation overhead. However, this overhead is not always intrinsically necessary: in many cases, while the concepts of the DSL on which a static analysis is performed are domain-specific, the underlying algorithm employed in the analysis is actually domain-independent and thus can be reused in principle, depending on how it is specified. While current approaches either implement static analyses internally or with an external Visitor, the implementation is tied to the language's grammar and cannot be reused easily.

Thus far, a commonly used approach that achieves reusable static analysis relies on the transformation into an intermediate representation upon which the analysis is performed. This, however, entails a considerable additional implementation effort.

Approach: To remedy this, it has been proposed to map the necessary domain-specific concepts to the algorithm's domain-independent data structures, yet without a practical implementation and the demonstration of reuse. Thus, to make static analysis reusable again, we employ relational Reference Attribute Grammars (RAGs) by creating such a mapping to a domain-independent overlay structure using higher-order attributes.

Knowledge: We describe how static analysis can be specified on analysis-specific data structures, how relational RAGs can help with the specification, and how a mapping from the domain-specific language can be performed. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a static analysis for a DSL can be externalized and reused in another general purpose language.

Grounding: The approach was evaluated using the RAG system JastAdd. To illustrate reusability, we implemented two analyses with two addressed languages each: a cycle detection analysis used in a small state machine DSL and for detecting circular dependencies in Java types and packages, and an analysis of variable shadowing, applied to both Java and the Modelica modelling language. Thereby, we demonstrate the reuse of two analysis algorithms in three completely different domains. Additionally, we use the cycle detection analysis to evaluate the efficiency by comparing our external analysis to an internal reference implementation analysing all Java programs in the Qualitas Corpus and thereby are able to show that an externalized analysis incurs only minimal overhead.

Importance: We make static analysis reusable, again, showing the practicality and efficiency of externalizing static analysis for both DSLs and general purpose languages using relational RAGs.","(502, 17)","In software engineering, the use of static analysis has become increasingly important for assurance of reliable software systems. However, as the development of domain-specific languages (DSLs) becomes more common, handling their unique syntax and features in static analysis tools has become a challenge. This paper proposes a method for reusing existing static analysis tools across different DSLs by using reference attribute grammars (RAGs). 

RAGs are a powerful grammar formalism that can be used to unify the syntax and semantics of different DSLs by defining them in a single, common tree structure. By leveraging this structure, RAGs enable the reuse of existing static analysis tools across different DSLs. 

The proposed method works by translating the input program in a given DSL to the common tree structure defined by the RAG. This enables the use of existing static analysis tools, which can operate on the common tree structure. The results of the analysis are then translated back into the original DSL syntax. This method has been implemented using the Spoofax language workbench, which allows for efficient implementation of the RAG-based translation process. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied it to several DSLs with different syntax and semantic features, including a DSL for mathematical equations and a DSL for describing control flow. The experimental results demonstrate that the method is effective in enabling the reuse of existing static analysis tools across these different DSLs. 

Additionally, we discuss the limitations of our approach. The proposed approach is dependent on the correctness and completeness of existing static analysis tools for the common tree structure defined by the RAG. Also, the cost of implementing the translation process can be high, especially in cases where the syntax and semantic differences between DSLs are significant. Despite these limitations, we believe that RAG-based translation is a promising direction for enabling the reuse of existing static analysis tools across DSLs. 

In conclusion, this paper proposes a method for reusing existing static analysis tools across different DSLs using RAGs. The method enables the reuse of existing static analysis tools across different DSLs and has been shown to be effective in experimental evaluations. While limitations exist, the proposed method is promising and provides a foundation for future research on the topic.","(410, 18)","Context: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) enable domain experts to specify tasks and problems themselves, while enabling  general-purpose programming languages (GPLs) to solve them.

Weighted automata are nondeterministic automata with numerical weights on transitions.

They can define quantitative languages~$L$ that assign to each word~$w$ a real number~$L(w)$. In the case of infinite words, the value of a run is naturally computed as the maximum, limsup, liminf, limit-average, or discounted-sum of the transition weights. The value of a word $w$ is the supremum of the values of the runs over $w$. We study expressiveness and closure questions about these quantitative languages. We first show that the set of words with value greater than a threshold can be non-$\omega$-regular for deterministic limit-average and discounted-sum automata, while this set is always $\omega$-regular when the threshold is isolated (i.e., some neighborhood around the threshold contains no word).

We consider quantitative languages as those where semantics assign to sentences real values which represent the degree to which the sentence holds in a given model. This notion allows us to reason about the degree in which a property holds, instead of just its truth value.

We first focus on the expressive power of quantitative languages and investigate the question of what can be expressed in such languages. For this purpose, we study fragments of quantitative languages and investigate their expressiveness. In particular, we consider fragments with limited use of quantification and fragments with restrictions on the formulas that can be used. We prove that these fragments have different levels of expressiveness and are strictly nested, with each fragment being strictly less expressive than the next one. Moreover, we show that some of these fragments are expressively complete, meaning that any sentence in the full language can be expressed using only formulas from the fragment.

We then shift our focus to closure properties of quantitative languages. Closure properties describe how taking the closure of a set of formulas changes the set. We investigate which closure properties hold for different fragments of quantitative languages. We prove that some of the fragments are closed under taking the inverse, while others are not. Furthermore, we show that no fragment is closed under taking the square root, which is a fundamental operation in many quantitative settings.

Our investigation also includes a study of automata theory for quantitative languages. We prove that the expressive power of the standard automata models is limited, and we propose extensions that allow us to reason about the degree to which a property holds. Finally, we demonstrate that these extensions also yield results for the study of model checking and Synthesis problems.

The results of this paper provide new insights into the study of quantitative languages and their expressive power. Our findings are relevant both for theoretical questions, like the limits of expressiveness and the closure properties of the language, as well as practical questions, like the study of different decision problems in automata-based models.","(394, 18)","Weighted automata are nondeterministic automata with numerical weights on transitions.

Context. Tens of light hydrides and small molecules have now been detected over several hundreds ","Context. Tens of light hydrides and small molecules have now been detected over several hundreds sight lines sampling the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in both the Solar neighbourhood and the inner Galactic disk. They provide unprecedented statistics on the first steps of chemistry in the diffuse gas.

Aims. These new data confirm the limitations of the traditional chemical pathways driven by the UV photons and the cosmic rays (CR) and the need for additional energy sources, such as turbulent dissipation, to open highly endoenergetic formation routes. The goal of the present paper is to further investigate the link between specific species and the properties of the turbulent cascade in particular its space-time intermittency. Methods. We have analysed ten different atomic and molecular species in the framework of the updated model of turbulent dissipation regions (TDR). We study the influence on the abundances of these species of parameters specific to chemistry (density, UV field, and CR ionisation rate) and those linked to turbulence (the average turbulent dissipation rate, the dissipation timescale, and the ion neutral velocity drift in the regions of dissipation). Results. The most sensitive tracers of turbulent dissipation are the abundances of CH+ and SH+, and the column densities of the J = 3, 4, 5 rotational levels of H2 . The abundances of CO, HCO+, and the intensity of the 158 $\mu$m [CII] emission line are significantly enhanced by turbulent dissipation. The vast diversity of chemical pathways allows the independent determinations of free parameters never estimated before: an upper limit to the average turbulent dissipation rate, $\overline{\varepsilon}$ < 10$^{-23}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ for $n_H$=20 cm$^{-3}$, from the CH+ abundance; an upper limit to the ion-neutral velocity drift, $u_{in}$ < 3.5 km s$^{-1}$, from the SH+ to CH+ abundance ratio; and a range of dissipation timescales, 100 < $\tau_V$ < 1000 yr, from the CO to HCO+ abundance ratio. For the first time, we reproduce the large abundances of CO observed on diffuse lines of sight, and we show that CO may be abundant even in regions with UV-shieldings as low as $5 \times 10^{-3}$ mag. The best range of parameters also reproduces the abundance ratios of OH, C2H, and H2O to HCO+ and are consistent with the known properties of the turbulent cascade in the Galactic diffuse ISM. Conclusions. Our results disclose an unexpected link between the dissipation of turbulence and the emergence of molecular richness in the diffuse ISM. Some species, such as CH+ or SH+, turn out to be unique tracers of the energy trail in the ISM. In spite of some degeneracy, the properties of the turbulent cascade, down to dissipation, can be captured through specific molecular abundances.","(555, 19)","The turbulent structures and dynamics of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) have long been the subject of intense scrutiny. Chemical probes can greatly aid our understanding of this area of research, particularly when used in conjunction with numerical simulations that help to reveal the physical processes that drive turbulent motions. In this paper, we present a new theory called the TDR model that provides a powerful framework for interpreting and analyzing chemical data in the diffuse medium. Our approach is based on the idea that turbulent motions lead to significant variations in temperature and density on small scales, which in turn affect the chemical pathways that are responsible for molecular synthesis and destruction. By using a suite of numerical simulations that span a range of conditions commonly found in the ISM, we are able to isolate the key chemical signatures of turbulence that are observable with current observational methods.

The TDR model is based on the assumption that turbulence is a multifaceted phenomenon that involves both the stirring of the interstellar gas and the injection of energy into the medium through a variety of physical mechanisms. To capture these processes, we use a combination of analytical methods and numerical simulations that allow us to study the evolution of chemical species under idealized conditions. Our simulations show that the transport of gas and dust in the ISM is closely linked to the distribution of chemical species, and that the chemical signature of turbulence is driven primarily by the strength of the turbulence in the surrounding medium. We also discuss how our results relate to other recent work on the dynamics and chemistry of the ISM, highlighting some of the key areas where further research is needed.

Overall, our study provides new insights into the complex interplay between turbulent motions and chemical evolution in the diffuse ISM. We show that chemical probes can be highly effective tools for revealing the underlying physics of turbulence, and that the TDR model represents a promising approach to understanding this important area of research. Our results have implications for a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including star formation, cosmic ray acceleration, and the origin of life in the universe. Future observations and numerical simulations will be crucial for fully exploiting the potential of chemical probes in this exciting and rich scientific frontier.","(413, 13)","Context. Tens of light hydrides and small molecules have now been detected over several hundreds 10^6 solar masses in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). The detection of these species has opened up new avenues for understanding the physical and chemical processes that govern the evolution of the ISM. However, despite significant advances in our understanding of the chemical composition of the ISM, much remains to be learned about the underlying physical processes that govern the formation and destruction of these species. Turbulence is widely recognized as a key driver of chemical evolution in the ISM, but the precise mechanisms by which turbulence influences chemical composition remain poorly understood.

Research Question. This paper addresses the question of how turbulence influences chemical composition in the diffuse ISM. Specifically, we investigate the role of turbulence in regulating the formation and destruction rates of small molecules in the ISM.

Methodology. To address this question, we employ a combination of theoretical modeling and numerical simulations. Our approach is based on the Turbulent Diffusion-Reaction (TDR) model, which incorporates the effects of turbulence on diffusion and reaction rates in the ISM. The TDR model is a one-dimensional, time-dependent model that simulates the evolution of chemical composition in a turbulent medium. We use the TDR model to simulate the evolution of a range of small molecules, including H2, CO, and CH+, in a variety of turbulent environments.

Findings. Our simulations reveal that turbulence has a profound impact on the formation and destruction rate of small molecules. Specifically, we find that turbulence enhances the formation rate of small molecules by up to an order of magnitude, while also increasing their destruction rate by up to a factor of two. We also find that the effects of turbulence are highly dependent on the properties of the turbulent environment, including the level of turbulence, the size of the turbulent eddies, and the density of the ISM.

Implications. Our results have significant implications for our understanding of chemical composition in the ISM and for the interpretation of observational data. Specifically, our findings suggest that turbulence plays a critical role in regulating the abundance of small molecules, and that neglecting the effects of turbulence can lead to significant errors in predictions of chemical composition.

We present an experimental and theoretical description of the kinetics of coalescence of two water ","We present an experimental and theoretical description of the kinetics of coalescence of two water drops on a plane solid surface. The case of partial wetting is considered. The drops are in an atmosphere of nitrogen saturated with water where they grow by condensation and eventually touch each other and coalesce. A new convex composite drop is rapidly formed that then exponentially and slowly relaxes to an equilibrium hemispherical cap. The characteristic relaxation time is proportional to the drop radius R * at final equilibrium.

This relaxation time appears to be nearly 10 7 times larger than the bulk capillary relaxation time t b = R * $\eta$/$\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the gas--liquid surface tension and $\eta$ is the liquid shear viscosity. In order to explain this extremely large relaxation time, we consider a model that involves an Arrhenius kinetic factor resulting from a liquid--vapour phase change in the vicinity of the contact line. The model results in a large relaxation time of order t b exp(L/RT) where L is the molar latent heat of vaporization, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. We model the late time relaxation for a near spherical cap and find an exponential relaxation whose typical time scale agrees reasonably well with the experiment. 1.

Introduction Fusion or coalescence between drops is a key process in a wide range of phenomena: phase transition in fluids and liquid mixtures or polymers, stability of foams and emulsions, and sintering in metallurgy (Eggers 1998), which is why the problem of coalescence has already received considerable attention. Most of the studies of this process so far have been devoted to the coalescence of two spherical drops floating in a medium. The kinetics of the process before and after the drops have touched each other is governed by the hydrodynamics inside and outside the drops and by the van der Waals forces when the drops are within mesoscopic distance from each other (Yiantsios \& Davis 1991). The composite drop that results from the coalescence of two drops relaxes to a spherical shape within a time which is dominated by the relaxation of the flow inside and outside (Nikolayev, Beysens \& Guenoun 1996; Nikolayev \& Beysens 1997). There are no studies, to our knowledge, of the coalescence of two sessile drops after they touch each other. In this paper, we report a preliminary study of the dynamics and morphology of this process, in the case of hemispherical water droplets which grow slowly on a plane surface at the expense of the surrounding atmosphere, forming what is called 'dew' or 'breath figures' (Beysens et al. 1991; Beysens 1995). The drops eventually touch each other and coalesce to form an elongated composite","(514, 18)","The coalescence of sessile drops has been a focus of recent research due to its practical applications in various industries. Understanding the mechanics of coalescence is essential to designing surfaces with particular wetting properties and for controlling droplet formation and dynamics.

In general, coalescence refers to the process whereby two or more drops combine to form a single drop. Sessile drops, in particular, are drops that are stationary on a surface, as opposed to sliding or rolling. The coalescence of sessile drops occurs when two or more such drops come into contact on a surface, and the forces acting on the drops cause them to merge.

The factors influencing the coalescence of sessile drops are complex and dependent on a range of parameters, including surface topography, intermolecular forces, and drop size. A key parameter is the contact angle, which is the angle between the drop and the surface it is resting on. The contact angle is determined by the relative magnitudes of the various forces acting on the drop, including cohesion, adhesion, and gravitational forces.

Recent research has focused on developing a detailed understanding of the factors influencing coalescence and the dynamics of the process. Experimental techniques, including high-speed imaging and atomic force microscopy, have been employed to investigate the time-dependent behavior of coalescing sessile drops.

One area of particular interest is the effect of surface patterning on coalescence dynamics. For example, micro and nanoscale patterns have been shown to modify the wetting properties of surfaces, leading to changes in the contact angle and coalescence behavior.

Overall, the coalescence of sessile drops is a complex process with significant practical applications. Recent research has improved our understanding of the underlying mechanics and has opened up new possibilities for designing and engineering surfaces with tailored properties. Further work in this area is necessary to fully comprehend the dynamics of coalescence and to develop novel approaches to surface engineering.","(348, 15)","We present an experimental and theoretical description of the kinetics of coalescence of two water  sessile drops on a hydrophobic surface.

The experiments were conducted using a custom-built setup consisting of a temperature-controlled stage, a high-speed camera, and a droplet generator. The hydrophobic surface was prepared by coating a glass slide with a thin layer of fluoropolymer, resulting in a contact angle of approximately 110 degrees.

The sessile drops were generated using a droplet generator, which allowed for precise control over the drop size and volume.

The images were then analyzed using image processing software to extract the drop shape, size, and contact angle as a function of time.

A central question in routing games has been to establish conditions for the uniqueness of ","A central question in routing games has been to establish conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibrium, either in terms of network topology or in terms of costs. This question is well understood in two classes of routing games. The first is the non-atomic routing introduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of road traffic in which each player (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car has a negligible impact on the congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its expected delay. Under arbitrary topology, such games are known to have a convex potential and thus a unique equilibrium. The second framework is splitable atomic games: there are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a population of individuals (let them be cars in road traffic or packets in the communication networks). In this paper, we study two other frameworks of routing games in which each of several players has an integer number of connections (which are population of packets) to route and where there is a constraint that a connection cannot be split. Through a particular game with a simple three link topology, we identify various novel and surprising properties of games within these frameworks. We show in particular that equilibria are non unique even in the potential game setting of Rosenthal with strictly convex link costs. We further show that non-symmetric equilibria arise in symmetric networks. I. INTRODUCTION A central question in routing games has been to establish conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibria, either in terms of the network topology or in terms of the costs. A survey on these issues is given in [1]. The question of uniqueness of equilibria has been studied in two different frameworks. The first, which we call F1, is the non-atomic routing introduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of road traffic in which each player (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car has a negligible impact on the congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its expected delay. Under arbitrary topology, such games are known to have a convex potential and thus have a unique equilibrium [2]. The second framework, denoted by F2, is splitable atomic games. There are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a population of individuals. This type of games have already been studied in the context of road traffic by Haurie and Marcotte [3] but have become central in the telecom community to model routing decisions of Internet Service Providers that can decide how to split the traffic of their subscribers among various routes so as to minimize network congestion [4]. In this paper we study properties of equilibria in two other frameworks of routing games which exhibit surprising","(499, 21)","Load balancing congestion games are a class of games, played on a network, where each player chooses a path through the network in order to reach a destination node, subject to constraints on the amount of traffic that can flow along each edge. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of these games as the number of players goes to infinity, a regime that is of significant interest in the area of algorithmic game theory.

Our main focus is on the emergence of path congestion in these games, which arises when many players choose to use the same path through the network, leading to a drastic increase in the travel times along that path. We identify a phase transition in the behavior of the system as the number of players grows, where below a certain threshold the network remains uncongested, while above this threshold we observe a sharp increase in path congestion.

We also prove several results related to the stability and equilibria of load balancing congestion games. We show that for certain classes of networks, the games behave in a highly stable manner, with very little fluctuation in the traffic patterns even as the number of players grows large. We also establish the existence of pure Nash equilibria for these games for a range of network topologies, providing insights into the strategic behavior of players in these situations.

Finally, we examine the implications of these results for the design of distributed systems that make use of load balancing algorithms. In particular, we show that by fine-tuning the parameters of these algorithms, it is possible to achieve a desirable trade-off between the efficiency of the system and the amount of congestion that arises when many users are simultaneously accessing the system. These insights will be valuable for the design of large-scale distributed systems in a variety of contexts, from peer-to-peer file sharing networks to cloud computing platforms.

Overall, our work sheds light on the complex dynamics that arise in load balancing congestion games and provides a foundation for investigating these phenomena in a variety of settings. By understanding the asymptotic behavior of these games, we can develop more efficient and robust algorithms for managing traffic flows in large-scale networks.","(396, 12)","A central question in routing games has been to establish conditions for the uniqueness of  Nash equilibria, particularly in the context of load balancing congestion games. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of these games as the number of players increases, focusing on the relationship between the uniqueness of Nash equilibria and the structure of the underlying network. Our research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the conditions under which load balancing congestion games converge to a unique Nash equilibrium as the player population grows.

To address this question, we employ a combination of theoretical analysis and computational experiments. We begin by reviewing the existing literature on load balancing congestion games, highlighting the key results and open problems in this area. We then introduce a new framework for analyzing the asymptotic behaviorof these games, which involves the use of graph-theoretic concepts and probabilistic methods. Specifically, we develop a novel approach to characterizing the connectivity of the underlying network, which enables us to derive conditions for the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium in the limit of large player populations.

Our theoretical analysis reveals that the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in load balancing congestion games is closely tied to the topological properties of the network. We show that if the network is strongly connected and has a certain ""expansion"" property, then the Nash equilibrium is unique in the limit as the player population increases. Conversely, we demonstrate that if the network fails to satisfy these conditions, then there may exist multiple Nash equilibria even in the limit. These results have important implications for the design of load balancing algorithms, as they suggest that the choice of network topology can significantly impact the convergence properties of these algorithms.

In addition to our theoretical findings, we also conduct a series of computational experiments to validate our results and explore the practical implications of our analysis. We implement a range of load balancing algorithms on a variety of network topologies, including both synthetic and real-world networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the conditions we derived in our theoretical analysis have a significant impact on the convergence properties of the algorithms, with strongly connected networks with expansion properties exhibiting faster and more reliable convergence to the unique Nash equilibrium.

The implications of our research are far-reaching, with potential applications in a wide range of fields, including computer networks, transportation systems, and supply chain management. Our results provide a new understanding of the relationship between network topology and the convergence properties of load balancing games, which can inform the design of more efficient and effective algorithms for these problems.

Our research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the conditions under which load balancing congestion games converge to a unique Nash equilibrium as the player population grows.

To address this question, we employ a combination of theoretical analysis and computational experiments.

Our theoretical analysis reveals that the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in load balancing congestion games is closely tied to the topological properties of the network. We show that if the network is strongly connected and has a certain ""expansion"" property, then the Nash equilibrium is unique in the limit as the player population increases. Conversely, we demonstrate that if the network fails to satisfy these conditions, then there may exist multiple Nash equilibria even in the limit.

This paper demonstrates the usefulness of distributed local verification of proofs, as a tool for ","This paper demonstrates the usefulness of distributed local verification of proofs, as a tool for the design of self-stabilizing algorithms.In particular, it introduces a somewhat generalized notion of distributed local proofs, and utilizes it for improving the time complexity significantly, while maintaining space optimality. As a result, we show that optimizing the memory size carries at most a small cost in terms of time, in the context of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). That is, we present algorithms that are both time and space efficient for both constructing an MST and for verifying it.This involves several parts that may be considered contributions in themselves.First, we generalize the notion of local proofs, trading off the time complexity for memory efficiency.

This adds a dimension to the study of distributed local proofs, which has been gaining attention recently. Specifically, we design a (self-stabilizing) proof labeling scheme which is memory optimal (i.e., $O(\log n)$ bits per node), and whose time complexity is $O(\log ^2 n)$ in synchronous networks, or $O(\Delta \log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of nodes. This answers an open problem posed by Awerbuch and Varghese (FOCS 1991).

We also show that $\Omega(\log n)$ time is necessary, even in synchronous networks. Another property is that if $f$ faults occurred, then, within the requireddetection time above, they are detected by some node in the $O(f\log n)$ locality of each of the faults.Second, we show how to enhance a known transformer that makes input/output algorithms self-stabilizing. It now takes as input an efficient construction algorithm and an efficient self-stabilizing proof labeling scheme, and produces an efficient self-stabilizing algorithm.

When used for MST, the transformer produces a memory optimal self-stabilizing algorithm, whose time complexity, namely, $O(n)$, is significantly better even than that of previous algorithms. (The time complexity of previous MST algorithms that used $\Omega(\log^2 n)$ memory bits per node was $O(n^2)$, and the time for optimal space algorithms was $O(n|E|)$.) Inherited from our proof labelling scheme, our self-stabilising MST construction algorithm also has the following two properties: (1) if faults occur after the construction ended, then they are detected by some nodes within $O(\log ^2 n)$ time in synchronous networks, or within $O(\Delta \log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, and (2) if $f$ faults occurred, then, within the required detection time above, they are detected within the $O(f\log n)$ locality of each of the faults. We also show how to improve the above two properties, at the expense of some increase in the memory.","(547, 13)","This paper presents a novel approach for fast and compact self-stabilizing verification, computation, and fault detection of a minimum spanning tree (MST) in a distributed network. Our proposed algorithm guarantees that the network converges to an MST in a self-stabilizing manner, even under arbitrary node and link failures. Furthermore, our algorithm requires only a constant amount of memory at each node, making it highly scalable.

Our approach builds on the concept of self-stabilization, which enables a system to recover from any initial state to a correct state without any external intervention. To achieve self-stabilization in the context of an MST, we propose a distributed algorithm that utilizes a small set of local rules to ensure that each node maintains a consistent view of the network. Moreover, our algorithm relies on the notion of local computation, which enables each node to compute its next state based solely on its local information.

To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a series of simulations on various network topologies. Our results indicate that our algorithm exhibits fast and robust convergence to an MST, even under high network load and node churn. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits fault-tolerance, ensuring that the network remains stable even in the presence of faults.

In addition to its practical applications for distributed systems, our algorithm has theoretical implications for the field of self-stabilization. By demonstrating the feasibility of achieving self-stabilization in a distributed network with a constant amount of memory per node, our algorithm represents a significant advancement in the development of self-stabilizing algorithms.

In conclusion, our approach presents a practical and elegant solution for fast and compact self-stabilizing verification, computation, and fault detection of an MST in a distributed network.

This paper is concerned with a complete asymptoticanalysis as $\mathfrak{E} \to 0$ of the stationary ","This paper is concerned with a complete asymptoticanalysis as $\mathfrak{E} \to 0$ of the stationary Munk equation $\partial\_x\psi-\mathfrak{E} \Delta^2 \psi=\tau$ in a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbf{R}^2$, supplemented with boundaryconditions for $\psi $ and $\partial\_n \psi$. This equation is a simplemodel for the circulation of currents in closed basins, the variables$x$ and $y$ being respectively the longitude and the latitude. A crudeanalysis shows that as $\mathfrak{E} \to 0$, the weak limit of $\psi$ satisfiesthe so-called Sverdrup transport equation inside the domain, namely$\partial\_x \psi^0=\tau$, while boundary layers appear in the vicinity ofthe boundary.These boundary layers, which are the main center of interest of thepresent paper, exhibit several types of peculiar behaviour. First, thesize of the boundary layer on the western and eastern boundary, whichhad already been computed by several authors, becomes formally verylarge as one approaches northern and southern portions of the boudary,i.e. pieces of the boundary on which the normal is vertical. Thisphenomenon is known as geostrophic degeneracy. In order to avoid suchsingular behaviour, previous studies imposed restrictive assumptionson the domain $\Omega$ and on the forcing term $\tau$. Here, we provethat a superposition of two boundary layers occurs in the vicinity ofsuch points: the classical western or eastern boundary layers, andsome northern or southern boundary layers, whose mathematicalderivation is completely new. The size of northern/southern boundarylayers is much larger than the one of western boundary layers($\mathfrak{E}^{1/4}$ vs. $\mathfrak{E}^{1/3}$). We explain in detail how the superpositiontakes place, depending on the geometry of the boundary.Moreover, when the domain $\Omega$ is not connex in the $x$ direction,$\psi^0$ is not continuous in $\Omega$, and singular layers appear inorder to correct its discontinuities. These singular layers areconcentrated in the vicinity of horizontal lines, and thereforepenetrate the interior of the domain $\Omega$. Hence we exhibit some kindof boundary layer separation.

However, we emphasize that we remainable to prove a convergence theorem, so that the singular layerssomehow remain stable, in spite of the separation.Eventually, the effect of boundary layers is non-local in severalaspects. On the first hand, for algebraic reasons, the boundary layerequation is radically different on the west and east parts of theboundary.

As a consequence, the Sverdrup equation is endowed with aDirichlet condition on the East boundary, and no condition on the Westboundary. Therefore western and eastern boundary layers have in factan influence on the whole domain $\Omega$, and not only near theboundary. On the second hand, the northern and southern boundary layerprofiles obey a propagation equation, where the space variable $x$plays the role of time, and are therefore not local.","(540, 17)","The oceanic circulation is a complex system involving a number of physical processes that operate on a vast range of spatial and temporal scales. In many cases, these processes are strongly influenced by the presence of boundaries, such as coastlines or oceanic ridges, which can give rise to boundary layers that have a significant impact on the overall circulation pattern. In this paper, we present a mathematical study of one particular type of boundary layer: the degenerate boundary layer that occurs in large-scale ocean circulation problems.

The degenerate boundary layer arises when the thickness of the boundary layer becomes comparable to the characteristic length scales of the problem. In the context of large-scale ocean circulation, this can occur in regions where the Coriolis force is weak or vanishes, such as the equatorial regions or certain parts of the Southern Ocean. Under such conditions, the momentum equations that govern the flow exhibit a singular behavior, with the boundary layer becoming extremely thin and the velocity gradients becoming very large.

Our study focuses on the mathematical analysis of these degenerate boundary layers and their role in large-scale ocean circulation. We begin by deriving a set of simplified equations that capture the essential features of the degenerate boundary layer, including the dominance of advection over diffusion and the presence of strong lateral shear. We then carry out a detailed analysis of these simplified equations, using both analytical and numerical methods to investigate the behavior of the flow.

Our results show that the presence of degenerate boundary layers can have a significant impact on the overall circulation pattern in large-scale ocean systems. In particular, we find that the boundary layers can give rise to highly localized eddies and jets that are not captured by traditional models of the oceanic circulation. These features have important implications for a wide range of processes, including the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients, as well as the distribution of marine organisms.

Overall, our study highlights the important role played by degenerate boundary layers in large-scale ocean circulation problems and underscores the need for more accurate and detailed models to capture their behavior. Our results provide a foundation for further research in this area and have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of the global ocean system.","(411, 14)","This paper is concerned with a complete asymptoticanalysis as $\mathfrak{E} \to 0$ of the stationary 2D Navier-Stokes equations in a channel of width $2\pi$ with no-slip boundary conditions on the top and bottom walls.

We are interested in the behavior of the solution near the bottom wall, where the flow is expected to exhibit a degenerate boundary layer. Our goal is to provide a rigorous mathematical description of this boundary layer and its impact on the large-scale ocean circulation.

To address this problem, we employ a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. First, we use the method of matched asymptotics to derive an outer solution that describes the flow in the bulk of the channel. This solution is valid away from the bottom wall and is used as a reference to study the behavior of the flow near the wall. Next, we introduce a stretched coordinate near the bottom wall and expand the solution in powers of the stretching parameter. This expansion leads to a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the flow in the boundary layer. We solve these ODEs numerically using a shooting method and obtain the profiles of the velocity components and the vorticity in the boundary layer.

Our numerical results show that the boundary layer is characterized by a thin region near the bottom wall where the flow exhibits a rapid transition from a laminar to a turbulent state. This transition is accompanied by a significant increase in the vorticity and a change in the sign of the streamwise velocity component. We find that the thickness of the boundary layer grows algebraically with distance from the wall, indicating that the flow is not self-similar in the classical sense. Instead, we observe a power-law dependence of the boundary layer thickness on the distance from the wall.

Starting from a simple animal-biology example, a general, somewhat counter-intuitive property of diffusion random walks ","Starting from a simple animal-biology example, a general, somewhat counter-intuitive property of diffusion random walks is presented. It is shown that for any (non-homogeneous) purely diffusing system, under any isotropic uniform incidence, the average length of trajectories through the system (the average length of the random walk trajecto-ries from entry point to first exit point) is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion process and therefore depends only on the geometry of the system. This exact invariance property may be seen as a generalization to diffusion of the well known mean-chord-length property [1], leading to broad physics and biology applications. Let us first consider a practical animal-biology example that was at the origin of the theoretical work reported hereafter. It is well established, for diverse species, that the spontaneous displacement of insects such as ants, on an horizontal planar surface, may be accurately mod-eled as a constant-speed diffusion random-walk [2-4]. We assume that a circle of radius R is drawn on the surface and we measure the average time that ants spend inside the circle when they enter it (see Fig. 1). The last assumption is that measurements are performed a long time after ants were dropped on the surface, so that the memory of their initial position is lost : this is enough to ensure that no specific direction is favored and therefore that when ants encounter the circle, their incident directions are distributed isotropically. Simple Monte Carlo simulations of such experiments (see Fig. 2) indicate without any doubt that the average encounter time (time between entry into the circle and first exit), for a fixed velocity, depends only of the circle radius. It is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion walk : the mean free path $\lambda$ (average distance between two scattering events, i.e. between two direction-changes), and the single-scattering phase function p(u s , u i) (probability density function of the scattering direction u s for an incident direction u i). Furthermore, this average time scales as R/v, which means that the average trajectory-length < L > scales as R. The average trajectory-length would therefore be the same for different experiments with any insect species-or for any type of diffusive corpuscular motion. There are two reasons why this observation may initially sound counter-intuitive. The first reason is that the average length of diffusion trajectories between two points is known to scale approximately as d 2 /$\lambda$ where d is the distance between the two points (1). For shorter mean (1)This scaling would be exact for an infinite domain in the limit d >> $\lambda$ [5] c EDP Sciences","(500, 16)","Diffusive random walks have been extensively studied due to their usefulness in modeling various physical and biological phenomena. In this paper, we investigate an important invariance property of diffusive random walks that has so far been overlooked in the literature.

Specifically, we show that under certain conditions, the expected value of the square displacement of a particle undergoing a diffusive random walk remains invariant over time. This means that the average distance covered by the particle scales linearly with time, regardless of the underlying dynamics of the system.

We demonstrate this property both analytically and numerically, and provide a thorough discussion of its implications for various applications. In particular, we show that this invariance property has important consequences for the interpretation of experimental data in the field of diffusion processes.

Furthermore, we extend our analysis to encompass more general diffusive processes, such as the fractional Brownian motion. We find that the invariance property holds even in these more complex scenarios, and discuss how this result can be used to improve our understanding of the underlying physics.

Overall, our results provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental properties of diffusive random walks and their implications for various applications.

Our aim is to observationally investigate the cosmic Dark Ages in order to constrain star ","Our aim is to observationally investigate the cosmic Dark Ages in order to constrain star and structure formation models, as well as the chemical evolution in the early Universe. Spectral lines from atoms and molecules in primordial perturbations at high redshifts can give information about the conditions in the early universe before and during the formation of the first stars in addition to the epoch of reionisation. The lines may arise from moving primordial perturbations before the formation of the first stars (resonant scattering lines), or could be thermal absorption or emission lines at lower redshifts. The difficulties in these searches are that the source redshift and evolutionary state, as well as molecular species and transition are unknown, which implies that an observed line can fall within a wide range of frequencies. The lines are also expected to be very weak. Observations from space have the advantages of stability and the lack of atmospheric features which is important in such observations. We have therefore, as a first step in our searches, used the Odin satellite to perform two sets of spectral line surveys towards several positions. The first survey covered the band 547-578 GHz towards two positions, and the second one covered the bands 542.0-547.5 GHz and 486.5-492.0 GHz towards six positions selected to test different sizes of the primordial clouds. Two deep searches centred at 543.250 and 543.100 GHz with 1 GHz bandwidth were also performed towards one position. The two lowest rotational transitions of H2 will be redshifted to these frequencies from z~20-30, which is the predicted epoch of the first star formation. No lines are detected at an rms level of 14-90 and 5-35 mK for the two surveys, respectively, and 2-7 mK in the deep searches with a channel spacing of 1-16 MHz. The broad bandwidth covered allows a wide range of redshifts to be explored for a number of atomic and molecular species and transitions. From the theoretical side, our sensitivity analysis show that the largest possible amplitudes of the resonant lines are about 1 mK at frequencies <200 GHz, and a few micro K around 500-600 GHz, assuming optically thick lines and no beam-dilution. However, if existing, thermal absorption lines have the potential to be orders of magnitude stronger than the resonant lines. We make a simple estimation of the sizes and masses of the primordial perturbations at their turn-around epochs, which previously has been identified as the most favourable epoch for a detection. This work may be considered as an important pilot study for our forthcoming observations with the Herschel Space Observatory.","(464, 16)","The Dark Ages are one of the most interesting epochs in cosmic history, characterized by the universe being immersed in a pervasive fog of cold hydrogen gas. During this era, stars were just beginning to shine and light up the universe. It is assumed that this time period hosted the first generation of stars and galaxies whose birth could act as a beacon for future astronomers to discover. However, the universe's very first light is yet to be detected.

This research paper describes the first spectral line surveys, conducted to search for signals from the Dark Ages. Spectral line surveys are used to reveal redshifted 21cm emission from hydrogen gas in the early universe, which enables scientists to probe the cosmic dawn in detail. The surveys use radio telescopes, which are tailored to capture the remarkably weak signals from hydrogen gas. During the Dark Ages, hydrogen gas was the dominant matter component, thereby providing the ultimate chance for scientists to observe the first light.

The data collected from the spectral line surveys have opened up doors for new discoveries, revealing the early universe's evolution. The surveys have produced valuable insights into the early star formation processes, the formation of the first galaxies, the evolution of black holes, and galaxy clusters' birth. The observations have also enabled astronomers to explore the epoch of reionization, the point in time when stars and galaxies ionized the neutral hydrogen in the universe, leading to the formation of the first luminous objects in the cosmos.

The first spectral line surveys have provided some of the most exciting discoveries in the field of astronomy. The surveys' results have revealed a universe filled with dramatic processes, including supernovae, black hole explosions, and massive galaxy mergers. Radio telescopes have provided the ultimate tool for exploring the cosmos, allowing the observer to dial back the clock to the earliest parts of cosmic history and see the birth of the universe. 

In summary, the first spectral line surveys represent a significant leap in our quest to uncover the mysteries of the cosmic dawn. They have allowed astronomers to explore the earliest and most mysterious periods in cosmic history, revealing insights into the universe's formation processes and evolution. As new techniques and technology continue to emerge, scientists can continue to probe the Dark Ages and further unravel the universe's mysteries.","(433, 17)","Our aim is to observationally investigate the cosmic Dark Ages in order to constrain star  formation models and shed light on the epoch of reionization.

Physical phenomena are observed in many fields (sciences and engineering) and are often studied by ","Physical phenomena are observed in many fields (sciences and engineering) and are often studied by time-consuming computer codes. These codes are analyzed with statistical models, often called emulators. In many situations, the physical system (computer model output) may be known to satisfy inequality constraints with respect to some or all input variables. Our aim is to build a model capable of incorporating both data interpolation and inequality constraints into a Gaussian process emulator. By using a functional decomposition, we propose to approximate the original Gaussian process by a finite-dimensional Gaussian process such that all conditional simulations satisfy the inequality constraints in the whole domain. The mean, mode (maximum a posteriori) and prediction intervals (uncertainty quantification) of the conditional Gaussian process are calculated. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, some conditional simulations with inequality constraints such as boundary, monotonicity or convexity conditions are given. 1.

Introduction. In the engineering activity, runs of a computer code can be expensive and time-consuming. One solution is to use a statistical surrogate for conditioning computer model outputs at some input locations (design points). Gaussian process (GP) emulator is one of the most popular choices [23]. The reason comes from the property of the GP that uncertainty quantification can be calculated. Furthermore, it has several nice properties.

For example, the conditional GP at observation data (linear equality constraints) is still a GP [5]. Additionally, some inequality constraints (such as monotonicity and convexity) of output computer responses are related to partial derivatives. In such cases, the partial derivatives of the GP are also GPs. Incorporating an infinite number of linear inequality constraints into a GP emulator, the problem becomes more difficult. The reason is that the resulting conditional process is not a GP. In the literature of interpolation with inequality constraints, we find two types of meth-ods. The first one is deterministic and based on splines, which have the advantage that the inequality constraints are satisfied in the whole input domain (see e.g. [16], [24] and [25]). The second one is based on the simulation of the conditional GP by using the subdivision of the input set (see e.g. [1], [6] and [11]). In that case, the inequality constraints are satisfied in a finite number of input locations. Notice that the advantage of such method is that un-certainty quantification can be calculated. In previous work, some methodologies have been based on the knowledge of the derivatives of the GP at some input locations ([11], [21] and [26]). For monotonicity constraints with noisy data, a Bayesian approach was developed in [21]. In [11] the problem is to build a GP emulator by using the prior monotonicity","(536, 29)","In many fields of science and engineering, computer simulations or experiments of physical systems are often used to model complex real-world phenomena. However, simulating such systems can be computationally expensive, and conducting physical experiments can be time-consuming and costly. Gaussian process emulators provide a useful alternative by allowing researchers to create computationally efficient surrogate models that can accurately approximate the output of computer experiments.

In this paper, we explore the use of Gaussian process emulators for computer experiments with inequality constraints. Traditional Gaussian processes are unable to handle problems with inequality constraints, making it challenging to build accurate emulators for complex systems with these constraints. Our proposed approach allows for the incorporation of these constraints into the emulator, ensuring that the resulting model is both accurate and consistent with the constraints of the original system.

To illustrate the efficacy of our approach, we present several case studies in which we apply our Gaussian process emulator with inequality constraints to various computer experiments. Our method is compared to other popular surrogate modeling techniques, including polynomial chaos expansions and support vector regression. We demonstrate that our emulator consistently outperforms these methods, particularly when applied to systems with inequality constraints.

One key advantage of our approach is that it provides a flexible framework for handling uncertain input parameters and input/output noise. We incorporate a Bayesian framework to account for these uncertainties, allowing for probabilistic predictions and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, our method seamlessly handles larger and higher-dimensional datasets and can scale up to handle more complex systems.

Overall, our Gaussian process emulator with inequality constraints provides a valuable tool for the modeling of complex systems with computational or experimental constraints. Our approach is flexible, accurate, and computationally efficient, making it a promising surrogate modeling technique for a wide range of fields, including engineering, physics, and environmental science.","(335, 14)","Physical phenomena are observed in many fields (sciences and engineering) and are often studied by  simulating them using computational models.

However, traditional GP emulators do not account for inequality constraints, which are common in many physical systems.

This paper presents a new approach to GP emulators that incorporates inequality constraints. The proposed method uses a modified likelihood function that takes into account the constraints, allowing the GP emulator to accurately capture the behavior of the physical system while respecting the constraints. The method is based on the idea of transforming the constrained problem into an unconstrained one using a change of variables. This transformation allows the GP emulator to be trained on the transformed data, which can then be mapped back to the original space to obtain the final predictions.

The asymptotic concentration of the Fr{\'e}chet mean of IID random variables on a Rieman-nian manifold ","The asymptotic concentration of the Fr{\'e}chet mean of IID random variables on a Rieman-nian manifold was established with a central limit theorem by Bhattacharya \& Patrangenaru (BP-CLT) [6]. This asymptotic result shows that the Fr{\'e}chet mean behaves almost as the usual Euclidean case for sufficiently concentrated distributions. However, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the empirical mean is modified by the expected Hessian of the squared distance. This Hessian matrix was explicitly computed in [5] for constant curvature spaces in order to relate it to the sectional curvature. Although explicit, the formula remains quite difficult to interpret, and the intuitive effect of the curvature on the asymptotic convergence remains unclear.

Moreover, we are most often interested in the mean of a finite sample of small size in practice. In this work, we aim at understanding the effect of the manifold curvature in this small sample regime. Last but not least, one would like computable and interpretable approximations that can be extended from the empirical Fr{\'e}chet mean in Rie-mannian manifolds to the empirical exponential barycenters in affine connection manifolds. For distributions that are highly concentrated around their mean, and for any finite number of samples, we establish explicit Taylor expansions on the first and second moment of the empirical mean thanks to a new Taylor expansion of the Riemannian log-map in affine connection spaces. This shows that the empirical mean has a bias in 1/n proportional to the gradient of the curvature tensor contracted twice with the covariance matrix, and a modulation of the convergence rate of the covariance matrix proportional to the covariance-curvature tensor. We show that our non-asymptotic high concentration expansion is consistent with the asymptotic expansion of the BP-CLT. Experiments on constant curvature spaces demonstrate that both expansions are very accurate in their domain of validity.

Moreover, the modulation of the convergence rate of the empirical mean's covariance matrix is explicitly encoded using a scalar multiplicative factor that gives an intuitive vision of the impact of the curvature: the variance of the empirical mean decreases faster than in the Euclidean case in negatively curved space forms, with an infinite speed for an infinite negative curvature.

This suggests potential links with the stickiness of the Fr{\'e}chet mean described in stratified spaces. On the contrary, the variance of the empirical mean decreases more slowly than in the Euclidean case in positive curvature space forms, with divergence when we approach the limits of the Karcher \& Kendall concentration conditions with a uniform distribution on the equator of the sphere, for which the Fr{\'e}chet mean is not a single point any more.","(498, 15)","This paper examines the effect of curvature on the empirical mean in both Riemannian and affine manifolds.

Our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations, which demonstrate that the high concentration expansion provides accurate estimates of the mean even in low-dimensional manifolds and small sample sizes. Furthermore, we establish the optimality of our theoretical results in terms of the scaling of sample sizes and the dependence on curvature.

The first chapter concerns monotype population models. We first study general birth and death processes ","The first chapter concerns monotype population models. We first study general birth and death processes and we give non-explosion and extinction criteria, moment computations and a pathwise representation. We then show how different scales may lead to different qualitative approximations, either ODEs or SDEs.

The prototypes of these equations are the logistic (deterministic) equation and the logistic Feller diffusion process. The convergence in law of the sequence of processes is proved by tightness-uniqueness argument. In these large population approximations, the competition between individuals leads to nonlinear drift terms. We then focus on models without interaction but including exceptional events due either to demographic stochasticity or to environmental stochasticity. In the first case, an individual may have a large number of offspring and we introduce the class of continuous state branching processes. In the second case, catastrophes may occur and kill a random fraction of the population and the process enjoys a quenched branching property. We emphasize on the study of the Laplace transform, which allows us to classify the long time behavior of these processes. In the second chapter, we model structured populations by measure-valued stochastic differential equations. Our approach is based on the individual dynamics. The individuals are characterized by parameters which have an influence on their survival or reproduction ability. Some of these parameters can be genetic and are inheritable except when mutations occur, but they can also be a space location or a quantity of parasites. The individuals compete for resources or other environmental constraints. We describe the population by a point measure-valued Markov process. We study macroscopic approximations of this process depending on the interplay between different scalings and obtain in the limit either integro-differential equations or reaction-diffusion equations or nonlinear super-processes. In each case, we insist on the specific techniques for the proof of convergence and for the study of the limiting model. The limiting processes offer different models of mutation-selection dynamics. Then, we study two-level models motivated by cell division dynamics, where the cell population is discrete and characterized by a trait, which may be continuous. In 1 particular, we finely study a process for parasite infection and the trait is the parasite load. The latter grows following a Feller diffusion and is randomly shared in the two daughter cells when the cell divides. Finally, we focus on the neutral case when the rate of division of cells is constant but the trait evolves following a general Markov process and may split in a random number of cells. The long time behavior of the structured population is then linked and derived from the behavior a well chosen SDE (monotype population).","(478, 24)","This research paper explores the use of stochastic models to describe the behavior of structured populations. The focus is on developing scaling limits and long-time behavior for these models. The development of such models is crucial for the analysis of population dynamics since natural systems often exhibit complex structures.

The study of structured populations is relevant in various fields, including ecology, epidemiology, and genetics. The models presented in this paper take into account characteristics such as age, size, or location, which play significant roles in population dynamics. This research aims to provide tools for understanding the complex interactions occurring within populations and the factors influencing their behavior.

To achieve this goal, the paper begins by presenting models at the individual level, where stochastic processes govern the behavior of each member of the population. The authors then delve into multi-individual models, discussing how these interactions can influence the population dynamics. The use of stochastic models allows for the incorporation of randomness and uncertainty in the behavior of individuals, which may be key elements in the dynamics of some populations.

One challenging aspect when studying structured populations is the need to consider the long-term behavior of these systems. Therefore, the authors investigate the scaling limits of these models. Scaling limits provide information about the asymptotic behavior of the system, which is essential for understanding the dynamics of populations over extended periods.

The authors then apply the developed methods to various case studies such as predator-prey systems and epidemics. The results show that stochastic models can provide accurate predictions of population dynamics and capture subtle interactions. Furthermore, long-term behavior analysis reveals population behaviors, such as extinction probabilities or oscillating periods.

In summary, this research paper proposes a framework for the development of stochastic models to study structured populations. The use of scaling limits and long-term behavior analysis is critical for understanding the dynamics of these systems, which play a crucial role in various scientific domains. The applications to predator-prey systems and epidemics demonstrate the usefulness of these models for practical scenarios. The findings of this research can help to provide insights into complex interactions between individuals in populations and to build models capable of predicting their behavior over time.","(401, 19)","The first chapter concerns monotype population models.

In 1953, the physicists E. Inon\""u and E.P. Wigner introduced the concept of deformation of ","In 1953, the physicists E. Inon\""u and E.P. Wigner introduced the concept of deformation of a Lie algebra by claiming that the limit $1/c \rightarrow 0$, when c is the speed of light, of the composition law $(u,v) \rightarrow (u+v)/(1+(uv/c^2))$ of speeds in special relativity (Poincar\'e group) should produce the composition law $(u,v) \rightarrow u + v $ used in classical mechanics (Galil\'ee group). However, the dimensionless composition law $(u'=u/c,v'=v/c) \rightarrow (u'+v')/(1+u'v')$ does not contain any longer a perturbation parameter. Nevertheless, this idea brought the birth of the "" deformation theory of algebraic structures"", culminating in the use of the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of Lie algebras and one of the first applications of computer algebra in the seventies. One may also notice that the main idea of general relativity is to deform the Minkowski metric of space-time by means of the small dimensionless parameter $\phi/c^2$ where $\phi=GM/r$ is the gravitational potential at a distance r of a central attractive mass M with gravitational constant G. A few years later, a "" deformation theory of geometric structures "" on manifolds of dimension n was introduced and one may quote riemannian, symplectic or complex analytic structures. Though often conjectured, the link between the two approaches has never been exhibited and the aim of this paper is to provide the solution of this problem by new methods. The key tool is made by the "" Vessiot structure equations "" (1903) for Lie groups or Lie pseudogroups of transformations, which, contrary to the "" Cartan structure equations "", are still unknown today and contain "" structure constants "" which, like in the case of constant riemannian curvature, have in general nothing to do with any Lie algebra. The main idea is then to introduce the purely differential Janet sequence $0 \rightarrow \Theta \rightarrow T \rightarrow F_0 \rightarrow F_1 \rightarrow ... \rightarrow F_n \rightarrow 0$ as a resolution of the sheaf $\Theta \subset T$ of infinitesimal transformations and to induce a purely algebraic "" deformation sequence "" with finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps, even if $\Theta$ is infinite dimensional. The infinitesimal equivalence problem for geometric structures has to do with the local exactness at $ F_0 $ of the Janet sequence while the deformation problem for algebraic structures has to do with the exactness of the deformation sequence at the invariant sections of $F_1 $, that is ONE STEP FURTHER ON in the sequence and this unexpected result explains why the many tentatives previously quoted have not been successful. Finally, we emphasize through examples the part that could be played by computer algebra in any explicit computation.","(520, 10)","The aim of this research paper is to investigate deformation cohomology of algebraic and geometric structures and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the properties and applications of this mathematical concept.

Deformation cohomology is a mathematical tool that plays a fundamental role in the study of geometric and algebraic structures. It provides a framework to study deformations of structures, that is, continuous families of structures that are obtained from a given structure by a small perturbation. Such families arise naturally in several areas of mathematics and physics, including algebraic geometry, topology, and theoretical physics.

In the first part of the paper, we provide an introduction to deformation theory, including the main definitions and results. We describe in detail Lie algebra deformations and their cohomology groups, which are important in the study of Lie algebra homology and representation theory. Moreover, we introduce the concept of Hochschild cohomology, which is a generalization of the Lie algebra cohomology, and its relevance to the deformation theory of polynomial algebras.

In the second part of the paper, we focus on geometric aspects of deformation theory. We study moduli spaces, which are spaces that classify families of structures up to isomorphism. We provide a detailed description of moduli spaces of curves and their relation to the deformation theory of complex structures. Additionally, we introduce the concept of derived moduli spaces, which are spaces that classify not only families of structures but also certain derived structures.

In the final part of the paper, we discuss some of the applications of deformation cohomology in mathematics and physics. We provide examples of its use in the study of mirror symmetry, quantization, and noncommutative geometry. Moreover, we discuss the relation between deformation theory and algebraic geometry, and the role of deformation cohomology in the study of Calabi-Yau manifolds and their mirror symmetry.

In conclusion, this research paper provides an in-depth study of deformation cohomology of algebraic and geometric structures.

We used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to map a large field of approximately $2^{\circ} ","We used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to map a large field of approximately $2^{\circ} \times 2^{\circ}$ around the Sculptor group galaxy NGC~300 in the 21-cm line emission of neutral hydrogen. We achieved a $5 \sigma$ \ion{H}{i} column density sensitivity of $10^{19}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ over a spectral channel width of $8~\mathrm{km \, s}^{-1}$ for emission filling the $180'' \times 88''$ synthesised beam. The corresponding \ion{H}{i} mass sensitivity is $1.2 \times 10^{5}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, assuming a distance of $1.9~\mathrm{Mpc}$. For the first time, the vast \ion{H}{i} disc of NGC~300 has been mapped over its entire extent at a moderately high spatial resolution of about $1~\mathrm{kpc}$.

NGC~300 is characterised by a dense inner \ion{H}{i} disc, well aligned with the optical disc of $290^{\circ}$ orientation angle, and an extended outer \ion{H}{i} disc with a major axis of more than $1^{\circ}$ on the sky (equivalent to a diameter of about $35~\mathrm{kpc}$) and a different orientation angle of $332^{\circ}$. A significant fraction (about 43~per cent) of the total detected \ion{H}{i} mass of $1.5 \times 10^{9}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ resides within the extended outer disc. We fitted a tilted ring model to the velocity field of NGC~300 to derive the rotation curve out to a radius of $18.4~\mathrm{kpc}$, almost twice the range of previous rotation curve studies.

The rotation curve rises to a maximum velocity of almost $100~\mathrm{km \, s}^{-1}$ and then gently decreases again in the outer disc beyond a radius of about $10~\mathrm{kpc}$. Mass models fitted to the derived rotation curve yield good fits for Burkert and NFW dark matter halo models, whereas pseudo-isothermal halo models and MOND-based models both struggle to cope with the declining rotation curve.

We also observe significant asymmetries in the outer \ion{H}{i} disc of NGC~300, in particular near the edge of the disc, which are possibly due to ram pressure stripping of gas by the intergalactic medium (IGM) of the Sculptor group. Our estimates show that ram pressure stripping can occur under reasonable assumptions on the density of the IGM and the relative velocity of NGC~300. The asymmetries in the gas disc suggest a proper motion of NGC~300 toward the south-east. At the same time, our data exclude IGM densities of significantly higher than $10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ in the vicinity of NGC~300, as otherwise the outer gas disc would have been stripped.","(571, 13)","This paper presents an analysis of the gas and dark matter properties of the Sculptor group, focusing on the galaxy NGC 300. We use multi-wavelength observations obtained with different telescopes to study the kinematics, morphology, and physical properties of the neutral hydrogen gas and the dark matter halo in this system.

Our observations reveal a complex and extended gas distribution in NGC 300, with prominent spiral arms and two major gas streams extending to the northwest and southeast of the galaxy. The gas kinematics show a clear deviation from a regular rotating disk, with large-scale non-circular motions and velocity gradients. We find evidence for gas inflows toward the center of NGC 300, possibly driven by interactions with nearby companions or by a bar instability in the central region.

Our analysis of the dark matter distribution in NGC 300 is based on the assumption that the gas is in dynamical equilibrium with the underlying gravitational potential. By modeling the observed gas kinematics, we derive the mass profile of the dark matter halo and its main parameters, such as the concentration and the virial mass. Our results suggest that the dark matter halo in NGC 300 is less concentrated and less massive than typical halos in cosmological simulations.

We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies in the local Universe. The complex gas kinematics and morphology of NGC 300 reveal the importance of non-equilibrium processes in shaping the interstellar medium, such as gas inflows, outflows, and turbulence. The low concentration and low mass of the dark matter halo suggest that NGC 300 has experienced a relatively quiescent assembly history and that it may represent a transitional stage between dwarf and spiral galaxies.

Overall, our study demonstrates the power of deep and high-resolution observations of the neutral hydrogen gas and the dark matter halo in nearby galaxies, and provides new insights into the physics of galaxy evolution. Future observations with upcoming facilities, such as the Square Kilometer Array and the James Webb Space Telescope, will enable us to further investigate the properties of gas and dark matter in the Sculptor group and beyond.","(387, 13)","We used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to map a large field of approximately $2^{\circ}  \times 2^{\circ}$ around the Sculptor group's central galaxy, NGC 300.

The Sculptor group is one of the closest galaxy groups to the Milky Way, making it an ideal target for studying the interplay between gas, dark matter, and galaxy evolution.

Our analysis revealed a complex network of gas filaments and galaxy interactions within the Sculptor group.

We also found evidence of gas stripping and ram-pressure stripping in several galaxies within the group, suggesting that these processes play a significant role in shaping the gas distribution within the group.

In terms of dark matter, our analysis revealed a significant overdensity of dark matter in the vicinity of NGC 300, which is consistent with the presence of a large dark matter halo surrounding this galaxy.

Graphs are commonly used to characterise interactions between objects of interest. Because they are based ","Graphs are commonly used to characterise interactions between objects of interest. Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used in many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this paper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning.

This includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering the nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most existing techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not evolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended to deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at inferring labels or numerical values attached to nodes using both the graph and, when they are available, node characteristics. Balancing the two sources of information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or globally. In both contexts, supervised and un-supervised, data can be relational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or graph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a full graph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this context, natural tasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than clusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 1 Real networks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the original work of Moreno [51] in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing interest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling and the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific fields. In Biology [54, 2, 7], for instance, metabolic networks can describe pathways of biochemical reactions [41], while in social sciences networks are used to represent relation ties between actors [66, 56, 36, 34]. Other examples include powergrids [71] and the web [75]. Recently, networks have also been considered in other areas such as geography [22] and history [59, 39]. In machine learning, networks are seen as powerful tools to model problems in order to extract information from data and for prediction purposes. This is the object of this paper. For more complete surveys, we refer to [28, 62, 49, 45].

In this section, we introduce notations and highlight properties shared by most real networks. In Section 2, we then consider methods aiming at extracting information from a unique network. We will particularly focus on clustering methods where the goal is to find clusters of vertices. Finally, in Section 3, techniques that take a series of networks into account, where each network is","(523, 25)","Graphs have emerged as a powerful tool in the field of machine learning due to their ability to capture and represent complex data relationships. In this paper, we introduce the fundamentals of graphs and their applications in machine learning.

We begin by discussing the basics of graph theory, including different types of graphs such as directed and undirected graphs, and their representation using adjacency matrices and lists. Next, we explore how graphs can be used to model various aspects of machine learning, such as clustering and classification.

One key application of graphs in machine learning is community detection, where nodes within a graph are grouped into clusters based on their structural similarities. We review different approaches to community detection, including modularity optimization and spectral clustering, and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. 

Another important application is graph-based semi-supervised learning, where partially labeled data is used to predict labels for unlabeled nodes within a graph. We explore different semi-supervised learning algorithms, such as label propagation and graph convolutional networks, and discuss their performance on real-world datasets.

We also discuss the use of graphs in deep learning, specifically graph neural networks (GNNs), which can be applied to various tasks such as node classification and link prediction. We provide an overview of different types of GNNs, including graph attention networks and graph convolutional networks, and compare their performance with traditional deep learning models.

Finally, we discuss some of the challenges and open research problems in the field of graph-based machine learning, such as scalability and interpretability. We conclude by summarizing the key points of the paper and highlighting the potential impact of graphs in future machine learning applications.

Context: Computational notebooks are a contemporary style of literate programming, in which users can communicate ","Context: Computational notebooks are a contemporary style of literate programming, in which users can communicate and transfer knowledge by interleaving executable code, output, and prose in a single rich document. A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is an artificial software language tailored for a particular application domain. Usually, DSL users are domain experts that may not have a software engineering background. As a consequence, they might not be familiar with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Thus, the development of tools that offer different interfaces for interacting with a DSL is relevant.

Inquiry: However, resources available to DSL designers are limited. We would like to leverage tools used to interact with general purpose languages in the context of DSLs. Computational notebooks are an example of such tools. Then, our main question is: What is an efficient and effective method of designing and implementing notebook interfaces for DSLs? By addressing this question we might be able to speed up the development of DSL tools, and ease the interaction between end-users and DSLs.

Approach: In this paper, we present Bacat\'a, a mechanism for generating notebook interfaces for DSLs in a language parametric fashion. We designed this mechanism in a way in which language engineers can reuse as many language components (e.g., language processors, type checkers, code generators) as possible.

Knowledge: Our results show that notebook interfaces generated by Bacat\'a can be automatically generated with little manual configuration. There are few considerations and caveats that should be addressed by language engineers that rely on language design aspects. The creation of a notebook for a DSL with Bacat\'a becomes a matter of writing the code that wires existing language components in the Rascal language workbench with the Jupyter platform.

Grounding: We evaluate Bacat\'a by generating functional computational notebook interfaces for three different non-trivial DSLs, namely: a small subset of Halide (a DSL for digital image processing), SweeterJS (an extended version of JavaScript), and QL (a DSL for questionnaires). Additionally, it is relevant to generate notebook implementations rather than implementing them manually. We measured and compared the number of Source Lines of Code (SLOCs) that we reused from existing implementations of those languages.

Importance: The adoption of notebooks by novice-programmers and end-users has made them very popular in several domains such as exploratory programming, data science, data journalism, and machine learning. Why are they popular? In (data) science, it is essential to make results reproducible as well as understandable. However, notebooks are only available for GPLs. This paper opens up the notebook metaphor for DSLs to improve the end-user experience when interacting with code and to increase DSLs adoption.","(508, 23)","Bacatá is a novel solution for developing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) with minimal cost, reducing the time spent on creating compilers and interpreters, and enabling developers to focus on the language semantics. This paper presents the Bacatá system, which uses notation and tooling to facilitate the development of DSLs and their associated tooling. Bacatá provides a set of notebooks with pre-defined and customizable templates making it incredibly easy and highly efficient to create DSLs.

Creating DSLs traditionally requires significant resources, thus limiting DSLs' popularity and usage. However, Bacatá significantly reduces the time and cost needed for the development of DSLs; furthermore, Bacatá offers a magnificent solution for domain experts and non-expert programmers to create simpler and more manageable DSLs.

The Bacatá notebooks provide pre-established tools, which allow programmers to create DSLs close to their domain language. For instance, by providing an interface for specifying the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), the notebooks offer DSL designers an incredibly powerful tool for selecting and crafting the language syntax. Bacatá revolutionizes the world of DSL designing, eliminating the need for an in-depth understanding of metaprogramming APIs, syntax analysis, and compiler design.

Our research shows that Bacatá notebooks have a low learning curve, making it possible for new developers to use them effectively. Bacatá increases productivity, thus, enhancing the development process of DSLs to improve the development process. This seamless approach raises the potential for the development of multiple DSLs within different domains, thus expanding their usage and adoption.

We provide comprehensive evaluation benchmarks using three established DSLs to demonstrate Bacatá's advantages in comparison to related DSL development solutions. Our results demonstrate that Bacatá eliminates the overhead of traditional DSL development. The evaluation also shows that Bacatá produces high-quality DSLs that are compatible with humans and tools.

In conclusion, Bacatá is a cost-effective and innovative solution for DSL development, which has a negligible learning curve and enhances productivity significantly. Bacatá’s notebooks’ functionality impressively simplifies the DSL design and produces high-quality DSLs in fewer development cycles. Hence, Bacatá shows the potential to assist developers and domain experts in crafting DSLs closer to their language, thereby effectively reducing the barriers to adopting DSLs.","(402, 17)","Context: Computational notebooks are a contemporary style of literate programming, in which users can communicate  ideas through code, text, and visualizations.

We generalize the classical cow-path problem [7, 14, 38, 39] into a question that is ","We generalize the classical cow-path problem [7, 14, 38, 39] into a question that is relevant for collective foraging in animal groups. Specifically, we consider a setting in which k identical (probabilistic) agents, initially placed at some central location, collectively search for a treasure in the two-dimensional plane. The treasure is placed at a target location by an adversary and the goal is to find it as fast as possible as a function of both k and D, where D is the distance between the central location and the target.

This is biologically motivated by cooperative, central place foraging such as performed by ants around their nest. In this type of search there is a strong preference to locate nearby food sources before those that are further away.

Our focus is on trying to find what can be achieved if communication is limited or altogether absent. Indeed, to avoid overlaps agents must be highly dispersed making communication difficult. Furthermore, if agents do not commence the search in synchrony then even initial communication is problematic. This holds, in particular, with respect to the question of whether the agents can communicate and conclude their total number, k. It turns out that the knowledge of k by the individual agents is crucial for performance. Indeed, it is a straightforward observation that the time required for finding the treasure is $\Omega$(D + D 2 /k), and we show in this paper that this bound can be matched if the agents have knowledge of k up to some constant approximation. We present an almost tight bound for the competitive penalty that must be paid, in the running time, if agents have no information about k. Specifically, on the negative side, we show that in such a case, there is no algorithm whose competitiveness is O(log k). On the other hand, we show that for every constant $\epsilon \textgreater{} 0$, there exists a rather simple uniform search algorithm which is $O( \log^{1+\epsilon} k)$-competitive. In addition, we give a lower bound for the setting in which agents are given some estimation of k.

As a special case, this lower bound implies that for any constant $\epsilon \textgreater{} 0$, if each agent is given a (one-sided) $k^\epsilon$-approximation to k, then the competitiveness is $\Omega$(log k).

Informally, our results imply that the agents can potentially perform well without any knowledge of their total number k, however, to further improve, they must be given a relatively good approximation of k. Finally, we propose a uniform algorithm that is both efficient and extremely simple suggesting its relevance for actual biological scenarios.","(513, 14)","Collaborative search on the plane without communication presents a novel approach to solving the task of finding a target on a flat surface, without the use of communication among the searchers. This is a challenging, yet realistic problem that has not been fully explored in the literature to date. The proposed solution consists of a distributed algorithm that leverages a combination of individual heuristic rules and probabilistic reasoning to guide the searchers towards the target. 

Each searcher is equipped with a sensor that can detect the target with some level of uncertainty and can communicate only with very close neighbors within a certain range. No global information about the sensor measurements or search process is shared among the searchers, which makes the task quite complex. The algorithm is designed to enable the searchers to coordinate their movements and avoid redundant exploration by exploiting the limited communication capabilities. 

The algorithm incorporates a distributed consensus mechanism, where each searcher maintains its belief about the target's location based on its sensor readings and the interactions with its neighbors. This belief is updated by combining the information from its own observations with that of its neighbors using a Bayesian inference framework. The final consensus is reached by using a likelihood function that takes into account the uncertainty in the observations and the reliability of the neighbors. 

The proposed approach is evaluated using a set of simulations and compared to a centralized algorithm that has access to all the sensor measurements. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve comparable performance to the centralized algorithm, while using only local information and limited communication. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown to be scalable and robust to changes in the search environment, such as the disappearance and sudden reappearance of the target.

The proposed algorithm has several potential applications in the field of swarm robotics and autonomous systems. For example, it can be used in search and rescue operations, where a team of robots needs to search for a missing person in a hazardous environment. The algorithm can also be applied in precision agriculture, where a team of drones needs to identify and localize diseased crops in a field without the need for expensive communication infrastructure.

In conclusion, the proposed collaborative search algorithm presents a practical solution to the problem of finding a target on a plane without communication. The algorithm leverages a combination of distributed consensus, probabilistic reasoning, and individual heuristic rules to enable the searchers to coordinate their movements and avoid redundant exploration. The algorithm is shown to be robust and scalable, and has potential applications in many real-world scenarios.","(471, 18)","We generalize the classical cow-path problem [7, 14, 38, 39] into a question that is  fundamental to many real-world applications: how can multiple agents collaborate to search for a target on a plane without any form of communication? In this paper, we present a novel solution to this problem, which we refer to as ""Collaborative Search on the Plane without Communication"" (CSPwC).

The CSPwC problem arises in various domains, such as search and rescue operations, environmental monitoring, and surveillance. In these scenarios, multiple agents, often with limited resources and capabilities, need to work together to locate a target, such as a missing person, a pollutant source, or an enemy position. The absence of communication between agents complicates the search process, as each agent must rely solely on its local information and observations to make decisions.

Our approach to CSPwC is based on a combination of geometric and probabilistic techniques. We model the search space as a two-dimensional plane, where each agent is represented by a point. The target is assumed to be a single point on the plane, and its location is unknown to all agents. Each agent has a limited sensing range, which allows it to detect the target if it is within a certain distance. We use a probabilistic framework to quantify the likelihood of each agent detecting the target, given its current position and the positions of other agents.

To solve CSPwC, we propose a decentralized algorithm that operates in rounds. In each round, each agent observes its surroundings, updates its belief about the target's location, and moves to a new position. The algorithm is designed to balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring that agents cover the search space efficiently while minimizing the risk of missing the target. We prove that our algorithm converges to a near-optimal solution, where the probability of detecting the target approaches 1 as the number of rounds increases.

Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CSPwC in various scenarios, including uniform and non-uniform target distributions, different sensing ranges, and varying numbers of agents. We compare our algorithm to several baseline methods, including random search and a centralized approach, and show that CSPwC outperforms these methods in terms of detection probability and search efficiency.

The implications of our work are significant, as CSPwC provides a scalable and robust solution to the collaborative search problem.

With the aim of quantifying the contribution of the environment on the evolution of galaxies ","With the aim of quantifying the contribution of the environment on the evolution of galaxies at z=0 we have used the DR7 catalogue of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to reconstruct the 3-D distribution of 4132 galaxies in 420 square degrees of the Coma supercluster, containing two rich clusters (Coma and A1367), several groups, and many filamentary structures belonging to the ""Great Wall"", at the approximate distance of 100 Mpc. At this distance the galaxy census is complete to Mi=-17.5 mag, i.e. approx 4 mag fainter than M*.

The morphological classification of galaxies into early- (ellipticals) and late-types (spirals) was carried out by inspection of individual SDSS images and spectra. The density around each galaxies was determined in cylinders of 1 Mpc radius and 1000 km s^-1 half length. The color-luminosity relation was derived for galaxies in bins morphological type and in four thresholds of galaxy density-contrast, ranging from delta{1,1000} <= 0 (UL = the cosmic web); 0 < delta{1,1000} <= 4 (L = the loose groups); 4 < delta{1,1000} <= 20 (H = the large groups and the cluster's outskirts) and delta{1,1000} > 20 (UH = the cluster's cores). The fraction of early-type galaxies increases with the log of the over-density. A well defined ""red sequence"" composed of early-type galaxies exists in all environments at high luminosity, but it lacks of low luminosity (dwarf) galaxies in the lowest density environment. Conversely low luminosity isolated galaxies are predominantly of late-type. In other words the low luminosity end of the distribution is dominated by red dE galaxies in clusters and groups and by dwarf blue amorphous systems in the lowest density regions.

At z=0 we find evidence for strong evolution induced by the environment (Nurture). Transformations take place mostly at low luminosity when star forming dwarf galaxies inhabiting low density environments migrate into amorphous passive dwarf ellipticals in their infall into denser regions. The mechanism involves suppression of the star formation due to gas stripping, without significant mass growth, as proposed by Boselli et al. (2008a). This process is more efficient and fast in ambients of increasing density. In the highest density environments (around clusters) the truncation of the star formation happens fast enough (few 100 Myr) to produce the signature of post-star-burst in galaxy spectra. PSB galaxies, that are in fact found significantly clustered around the largest dynamical units, represent the remnants of star forming isolated galaxies that had their star formation violently suppressed during their infall in clusters in the last 0.5-1.5 Gyrs, and the progenitors of future dEs.","(500, 17)","The Great Wall is a strip of dense clusters, stretching for around 500 million light years in the Universe. It is one of the largest and most impressive known structures in the cosmos, making it an ideal location for investigating galaxy evolution. In this paper, we present a snapshot of galaxy evolution and the role of nurture in this process at redshift (z) equal to zero.

We have used deep, multi-wavelength surveys to study the Great Wall and its associated environment, with the aim of identifying and characterizing the properties of the galaxies inhabiting this colossal structure. Our analysis reveals a diverse population of galaxies, ranging from massive ellipticals to small dwarf galaxies. We have also observed significant variations in the properties of these galaxies, such as their star formation rate, color, and morphology.

Using sophisticated statistical techniques, we have quantified the relative importance of nurture (environment) and nature (intrinsic properties) in shaping the observed galaxy population. Our results indicate that nurture plays a crucial role in driving galaxy evolution, by affecting the star formation rate and morphological transformation of the galaxies.

We have also investigated the connection between galaxy properties and their position within the Great Wall. Our analysis has revealed that galaxies residing in the densest regions of the structure tend to have lower star formation rates and redder colors than those located in the outskirts. This suggests that the Great Wall acts as a ""galaxy zoo"", hosting a broad range of galaxies, but with properties that are sensitive to their environment.

Finally, we have compared our findings with predictions from cosmological simulations, revealing a good agreement with the simulated galaxy population, suggesting that our results can be generalized to other similar structures in the Universe.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of galaxy evolution occurring in the Great Wall, highlighting the crucial role played by nurture in shaping the observed galaxy population. Our results shed light on the complex interplay between galaxies and their environment and offer new insights into the physical processes that regulate galaxy formation and evolution.","(384, 14)","With the aim of quantifying the contribution of the environment on the evolution of galaxies 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang, we present a comprehensive analysis of the galaxy population within the Great Wall, a vast network of galaxy filaments spanning over 500 million light-years across the observable universe. Our research seeks to address the long-standing debate on the interplay between nurture (environmental influences) and nature (intrinsic properties) in shaping galaxy evolution.

Utilizing a combination of spectroscopic and photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we have compiled a sample of over 100,000 galaxies within the redshift range of 0.05 < z < 0.15, which corresponds to a look-back time of approximately 1.5 billion years. Our sample encompasses a diverse range of galaxy types, including spiral, elliptical, and irregular galaxies, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies.

To investigate the impact of the environment on galaxy evolution, we employed a suite of statistical and machine learning techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), k-means clustering, and random forest regression. These methods enabled us to identify distinct galaxy populations and quantify the relationships between galaxy properties, such as stellar mass, star formation rate, and gas content, and environmental factors, such as galaxy density, distance to the nearest neighbor, and large-scale structure.

Our analysis reveals a complex interplay between nurture and nature in shaping galaxy evolution within the Great Wall. We find that galaxies residing in denser environments exhibit enhanced star formation rates, higher gas contents, and more massive stellar populations compared to their counterparts in lower-density regions. Conversely, galaxies in lower-density environments tend to have lower star formation rates, lower gas contents, and less massive stellar populations.

Furthermore, our results indicate that the relationship between galaxy properties and environmental factors is highly non-linear, with galaxies in intermediate-density regions exhibiting the most extreme properties. This suggests that the environment plays a crucial role in regulating galaxy evolution, particularly in the context of star formation and gas accretion.

We establish weak well-posedness for critical symmetric stable driven SDEs in R d with additive ","We establish weak well-posedness for critical symmetric stable driven SDEs in R d with additive noise Z, d $\ge$ 1. Namely, we study the case where the stable index of the driving process Z is $\alpha$ = 1 which exactly corresponds to the order of the drift term having the coefficient b which is continuous and bounded. In particular, we cover the cylindrical case when Zt = (Z 1 t ,. .. , Z d t) and Z 1 ,. .. , Z d are independent one dimensional Cauchy processes.

Our approach relies on L p-estimates for stable operators and uses perturbative arguments. 1. Statement of the problem and main results We are interested in proving well-posedness for the martingale problem associated with the following SDE: (1.1) X t = x + t 0 b(X s)ds + Z t , where (Z s) s$\ge$0 stands for a symmetric d-dimensional stable process of order $\alpha$ = 1 defined on some filtered probability space ($\Omega$, F, (F t) t$\ge$0 , P) (cf. [2] and the references therein) under the sole assumptions of continuity and boundedness on the vector valued coefficient b: (C) The drift b : R d $\rightarrow$ R d is continuous and bounded. 1 Above, the generator L of Z writes: L$\Phi$(x) = p.v.

R d \{0} [$\Phi$(x + z) -- $\Phi$(x)]$\nu$(dz), x $\in$ R d , $\Phi$ $\in$ C 2 b (R d), $\nu$(dz) = d$\rho$ $\rho$ 2$\mu$ (d$\theta$), z = $\rho$$\theta$, ($\rho$, $\theta$) $\in$ R * + x S d--1. (1.2) (here $\times$, $\times$ (or $\times$) and | $\times$ | denote respectively the inner product and the norm in R d). In the above equation, $\nu$ is the L{\'e}vy intensity measure of Z, S d--1 is the unit sphere of R d and$\mu$ is a spherical measure on S d--1. It is well know, see e.g. [20] that the L{\'e}vy exponent $\Phi$ of Z writes as: (1.3) $\Phi$($\lambda$) = E[exp(i $\lambda$, Z 1)] = exp -- S d--1 | $\lambda$, $\theta$ |$\mu$(d$\theta$) , $\lambda$ $\in$ R d , where $\mu$ = c 1$\mu$ , for a positive constant c 1 , is the so-called spectral measure of Z. We will assume some non-degeneracy conditions on $\mu$. Namely we introduce assumption (ND) There exists $\kappa$ $\ge$ 1 s.t. (1.4) $\forall$$\lambda$ $\in$ R d , $\kappa$ --1 |$\lambda$| $\le$ S d--1 | $\lambda$, $\theta$ |$\mu$(d$\theta$) $\le$ $\kappa$|$\lambda$|. 1 The boundedness of b is here assumed for technical simplicity. Our methodology could apply, up to suitable localization arguments, to a drift b having linear growth.","(704, 20)","We investigate the weak well-posedness of multidimensional SDEs driven by stable Lévy processes with index in the range $(1,2]$. In particular, we consider the critical case where the Lévy index equals $2$. Under some regularity assumptions on the coefficients, we prove that the SDE under consideration admits a unique weak solution. Moreover, we show that this solution is a Markov process with continuous paths. Our proof is based on the approximation of the SDE by a sequence of better-behaved SDEs and the application of the PDE method for the latter. We further demonstrate the necessity of our assumptions by providing examples where either uniqueness or continuity of the solution fails. In addition, we provide a comparison result for two different stability indices. Our results generalize the well-known case of Brownian motion, and we believe that they may find applications in various fields including finance, physics, and engineering. Finally, we mention some open problems such as the extension of our results to non-Markovian settings and the study of regularity properties of the solutions. We hope that our work will contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of stochastic differential equations driven by stable Lévy processes, which are known to exhibit various exotic phenomena such as jumps, long-range dependence, and heavy tails.","(238, 10)","We establish weak well-posedness for critical symmetric stable driven SDEs in R d with additive 1-stable Lévy noise in the multidimensional setting. Our work addresses a long-standing open problem in the field of stochastic analysis, which has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its relevance to modeling complex phenomena in physics, finance, and other fields.

The research question at the core of this paper revolves around the well-posedness of SDEs driven by stable Lévy processes. Specifically, we focus on the critical case, where the Hurst parameter H equals 1/2, and the dimension d is greater than or equal to 2. In this context, the notion of well-posedness refers to the existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions to the given SDE. The critical case is particularly challenging due to the singularity of the stable Lévy measure at the origin, which leads to a loss of regularity in the coefficients of the SDE.

To tackle this problem, we employ a combination of techniques from stochastic analysis, harmonic analysis, and potential theory. Our approach involves the use of Malliavin calculus, which provides a powerful tool for studying the regularity properties of stochastic processes. We also draw upon results from the theory of Riesz potentials, which are essential for handling the singularities associated with stable Lévy measures.

Our main result establishes the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the critical stable driven SDE in R d. We achieve this by showing that the solution map associated with the SDE is continuous with respect to the initial condition and the driving Lévy noise. This continuity property is a crucial ingredient in our proof, as it enables us to apply a fixed-point argument to establish the existence of a weak solution.

Our work addresses a long-standing open problem in the field of stochastic analysis, which has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its relevance to modeling complex phenomena in physics, finance, and other fields.

The research question at the core of this paper revolves around the well-posedness of SDEs driven by stable Lévy processes. Specifically, we focus on the critical case, where the Hurst parameter H equals 1/2, and the dimension d is greater than or equal to 2. In this context, the notion of well-posedness refers to the existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions to the given SDE. The critical case is particularly challenging due to the singularity of the stable Lévy measure at the origin, which leads to a loss of regularity in the coefficients of the SDE.

To tackle this problem, we employ a combination of techniques from stochastic analysis, harmonic analysis, and potential theory. Our approach involves the use of Malliavin calculus, which provides a powerful tool for studying the regularity properties of stochastic processes. We also draw upon results from the theory of Riesz potentials, which are essential for handling the singularities associated with stable Lévy measures.

-Purpose: A neural network estimator to process x-ray spectral measurements from photon counting detectors with ","-Purpose: A neural network estimator to process x-ray spectral measurements from photon counting detectors with pileup. The estimator is used with an expansion of the attenuation coefficient as a linear combination of functions of energy multiplied by coefficients that depend on the material composition at points within the object [R.E. Alvarez and A. Macovski, Phys. Med. Biol., 1976, 733-744]. The estimator computes the line integrals of the coefficients from measurements with different spectra. Neural network estimators are trained with measurements of a calibration phantom with the clinical x-ray system. One estimator uses low noise training data and another network is trained with data computed by adding random noise to the low noise data. The performance of the estimators is compared to each other and to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).

Methods: The estimator performance is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation with an idealized model of a photon counting detector that includes only pileup and quantum noise. Transmitted x-ray spectra are computed for a calibration phantom. The transmitted spectra are used to compute random data for photon counting detectors with pileup. Detectors with small and large dead times are considered. Neural network training data with extremely low noise are computed by averaging the random detected data with pileup for a large numbers of exposures of the phantom. Each exposure is equivalent to a projection image or one projection of a computed tomography scan. Training data with high noise are computed by using data from one exposure. Finally, training data are computed by adding random data to the low noise data. The added random data are multivariate normal with zero mean and covariance equal to the sample covariance of data for an object with properly chosen attenuation. To test the estimators, random data are computed for different thicknesses of three test objects with different compositions. These are used as inputs to the neural network estimators. The mean squared errors (MSE), variance and square of the bias of the neural networks' outputs with the random object data are each compared to the CRLB. Results: The MSE for a network trained with low noise data and added noise is close to the CRLB for both the low and high pileup cases. Networks trained with very low noise data have low bias but large variance for both pileup cases. ralvarez@aprendtech.com Networks trained with high noise data have both large bias and large variance. Conclusion: With a properly chosen level of added training data noise, a neural network estimator for photon counting data with pileup can have variance close to the CRLB with negligible bias.","(475, 25)","This paper proposes a near-optimal neural network estimator for spectral X-ray photon counting data with pileup. Spectral photon counting detectors (PCDs) have attracted significant interest as a promising technology for X-ray imaging and computed tomography. However, a major challenge with PCDs is the occurrence of pileup due to the high photon flux. Pileup leads to distortions in the energy spectrum and can compromise the accuracy of the reconstructed image. 

In this work, we present a novel approach to mitigate the pileup effect in spectral PCDs. The proposed estimator is based on a deep neural network architecture, which performs a nonlinear mapping of the measured photon counts to an estimate of the underlying photon spectrum. The network is trained on a large dataset of simulated photon counts, with varying levels of pileup and noise. The training dataset also incorporates realistic X-ray spectrum and detector response characteristics.

To optimize the neural network estimator, we introduce a new loss function that takes into account the statistical properties of photon counting and pileup. Specifically, the loss function uses a Poisson-Gamma mixture model to capture the effects of photon counting noise and pileup distortion on the measured counts. We also derive the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters, using a novel algorithm based on importance sampling.

Our experimental results show that the proposed estimator achieves near-optimal performance in terms of image quality and spectral accuracy, compared to state-of-the-art methods for spectral PCD reconstruction. We demonstrate this through extensive simulations on a range of X-ray imaging scenarios, including both phantom and patient datasets. Our results show that the proposed estimator is robust to variations in pileup and noise levels, and can effectively recover the true photon spectrum.

In conclusion, this paper proposes a novel and effective approach to address the pileup problem in spectral PCDs using a deep neural network estimator. The proposed method leverages the statistical properties of photon counting and pileup, and achieves near-optimal performance in spectral reconstruction. The proposed approach has potential applications in medical imaging, material characterization, and other fields that rely on X-ray spectroscopy.","(381, 17)","-Purpose: A neural network estimator to process x-ray spectral measurements from photon counting detectors with  pileup effects is proposed.

We build in this paper a numerical solution procedure to compute the flow induced by ","We build in this paper a numerical solution procedure to compute the flow induced by a spherical flame expanding from a point source at a constant expansion velocity, with an instantaneous chemical reaction. The solution is supposed to be self-similar and the flow is split in three zones: an inner zone composed of burnt gases at rest, an intermediate zone where the solution is regular and the initial atmosphere composed of fresh gases at rest. The intermediate zone is bounded by the reactive shock (inner side) and the so-called precursor shock (outer side), for which Rankine-Hugoniot conditions are written; the solution in this zone is governed by two ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically. We show that, for any admissible precursor shock speed, the construction combining this numerical resolution with the exploitation of jump conditions is unique, and yields decreasing pressure, density and velocity profiles in the intermediate zone. In addition, the reactive shock speed is larger than the velocity on the outer side of the shock, which is consistent with the fact that the difference of these two quantities is the so-called flame velocity, i.e. the (relative) velocity at which the chemical reaction progresses in the fresh gases. Finally, we also observe numerically that the function giving the flame velocity as a function of the precursor shock speed is increasing; this allows to embed the resolution in a Newton-like procedure to compute the flow for a given flame speed (instead of for a given precursor shock speed). The resulting numerical algorithm is applied to stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixtures.

1. Problem position. We address the flame propagation in a reactive infinite atmosphere of initial constant composition. The ignition is supposed to occur at a single point (chosen to be the origin of R 3) and the flow is supposed to satisfy a spherical symmetry property: the density $\rho$, the pressure p, the internal energy e and the entropy s only depend on the distance r to the origin and the velocity reads u = ur/r, where r stands for the position vector. The flame is supposed to be infinitely thin and to move at a constant speed. The flow is governed by the Euler equations, and we seek a solution with the following structure:","(503, 19)","This paper presents the modelling of a deflagration, a type of combustion where the flame front moves relatively slowly, in a spherical shape at constant speed. Deflagration occurs in many industrial and natural processes, such as explosions, combustion engines, and forest fires. The modelling of this phenomenon can help researchers and engineers understand and predict its behavior.

The mathematical model used in this paper considers the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy, as well as the reaction kinetics and the species transport of the fuel and the oxidizer. The governing equations are solved numerically using the commercial software ANSYS Fluent, which is based on the finite volume method. The simulations are conducted in a three-dimensional domain and the inflow and outflow conditions are assumed to be symmetric and steady-state.

The results show that the deflagration wave propagates at a constant speed, which depends on the initial conditions and the properties of the mixture. As the wave travels, it heats up the unburnt gas ahead of it, and consumes the fuel and the oxidizer behind it. The temperature and pressure distributions are affected by the curvature of the spherical surface, the diffusivity of the species, and the flame thickness. The flame thickness is defined as the distance where the fuel is converted to the products.

The sensitivity analysis shows that the flame speed, the activation energy, and the inlet velocity have the largest impact on the deflagration dynamics. The flame speed can be controlled by adjusting the fuel-oxidizer ratio, the temperature, or the turbulence intensity. The activation energy is the minimum energy required to initiate the reaction and can be changed by adding catalytic species or using external ignition. The inlet velocity is the rate at which the unburnt gas enters the domain and can be modified by the geometry or the boundary conditions.

The comparison with the experimental data available in the literature shows a good agreement with the present results, which confirms the validity of the model. The limitations and the future work of the model are discussed in the conclusion. In summary, this paper presents the modelling of a spherical deflagration at constant speed using a numerical approach, and provides insights into the physics and the chemistry of this important phenomenon.","(412, 17)","We build in this paper a numerical solution procedure to compute the flow induced by 3D spherical deflagration waves propagating at constant speed through an unconfined mixture of fuel and oxidizer. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately capture the complex interactions between the deflagration wave and the surrounding environment, including the effects of heat transfer, mass diffusion, and viscous dissipation.

To address this challenge, we employ a combination of numerical methods, including the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and the Level Set Method (LSM). The LBM is used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of the fluid, while the LSM is employed to track the interface between the burned and unburned regions. This approach allows us to capture the intricate details of the flow field, including the formation of vortices and the development of turbulence.

Our computational domain consists of a spherical region centered at the origin, with a radius of 10 cm. The initial conditions are set such that the mixture is at rest, with a uniform temperature and composition. The deflagration wave is then introduced at the center of the sphere, with a constant speed of 10 m/s. The simulation is run for a total time of 10 ms, during which the wave propagates through the mixture and interacts with the surrounding environment.

The results of our simulations reveal a complex flow pattern, characterized by the formation of a toroidal vortex behind the leading edge of the wave. This vortex is a result of the conservation of angular momentum, which causes the fluid to rotate as it is pushed aside by the advancing wave. The flow field is also marked by the presence of turbulent eddies, which are generated by the interaction between the wave and the surrounding fluid.

There currently exists a gap between the theories proposed by the probability and uncertainty and ","There currently exists a gap between the theories proposed by the probability and uncertainty and the needs of Artificial Intelligence research. These theories primarily address the needs of expert systems, using knowledge structures which must be pre-compiled and remain static in structure during runtime. Many Al systems require the ability to dynamically add and remove parts of the current knowledge structure (e.g., in order to examine what the world would be like for different causal theories). This requires more flexibility than existing uncertainty systems display. In addition, many Al researchers are only interested in using ""probabilities"" as a means of obtaining an ordering, rather than attempting to derive an accurate probabilistic account of a situation. This indicates the need for systems which stress ease of use and don't require extensive probability information when one cannot (or doesn't wish to) provide such information. This paper attempts to help reconcile the gap between approaches to uncertainty and the needs of many AI systems by examining the control issues which arise, independent of a particular uncertainty calculus. when one tries to satisfy these needs. Truth Maintenance Systems have been used extensively in problem solving tasks to help organize a set of facts and detect inconsistencies in the believed state of the world. These systems maintain a set of true/false propositions and their associated dependencies. However, situations often arise in which we are unsure of certain facts or in which the conclusions we can draw from available information are somewhat uncertain. The non-monotonic TMS 12] was an attempt at reasoning when all the facts are not known, but it fails to take into account degrees of belief and how available evidence can combine to strengthen a particular belief. This paper addresses the problem of probabilistic reasoning as it applies to Truth Maintenance Systems. It describes a belief Maintenance System that manages a current set of beliefs in much the same way that a TMS manages a set of true/false propositions. If the system knows that belief in fact is dependent in some way upon belief in fact2, then it automatically modifies its belief in facts when new information causes a change in belief of fact2. It models the behavior of a TMS, replacing its 3-valued logic (true, false, unknown) with an infinite valued logic, in such a way as to reduce to a standard TMS if all statements are given in absolute true/false terms. Belief Maintenance Systems can, therefore, be thought of as a generalization of Truth Maintenance Systems, whose possible reasoning tasks are a superset of those for a TMS.","(471, 17)","Belief maintenance systems play a crucial role in various fields including decision-making, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science.

Our proposed general-purpose system addresses these issues by incorporating a modular architecture that allows users to easily customize the system to suit their specific needs.

The probability and uncertainty community views belief maintenance as a process of updating probabilities in response to new information, whereas the AI community views it as a process of maintaining a consistent and coherent set of beliefs in the face of changing information. This dichotomy has hindered the development of a general-purpose belief maintenance system that can be applied across various domains.

This paper aims to bridge the gap between these two communities by proposing a novel approach to belief maintenance that combines the strengths of both perspectives. Our approach, which we refer to as probabilistic belief maintenance (PBM), utilizes a probabilistic framework to represent and update beliefs in a way that is consistent with the principles of probability theory. At the same time, PBM incorporates techniques from AI to ensure that the resulting beliefs are coherent and consistent with the available information.

To develop PBM, we employed a mixed-methods approach that involved both theoretical and empirical components. The theoretical component involved the development of a formal framework for probabilistic belief maintenance, which was based on a combination of probability theory and AI techniques. The empirical component involved the implementation and evaluation of PBM using a range of benchmark datasets and scenarios.

Our results show that PBM outperforms existing belief maintenance systems in terms of accuracy, coherence, and computational efficiency. Specifically, we found that PBM was able to maintain accurate and coherent beliefs in a wide range of scenarios, including those involving uncertain and incomplete information. We also observed that PBM was computationally more efficient than existing systems, particularly in scenarios involving large amounts of data.

The probability and uncertainty community views belief maintenance as a process of updating probabilities in response to new information, whereas the AI community views it as a process of maintaining a consistent and coherent set of beliefs in the face of changing information. This dichotomy has hindered the development of a general-purpose belief maintenance system that can be applied across various domains.

This paper aims to bridge the gap between these two communities by proposing a novel approach to belief maintenance that combines the strengths of both perspectives. Our approach, which we refer to as probabilistic belief maintenance (PBM), utilizes a probabilistic framework to represent and update beliefs in a way that is consistent with the principles of probability theory. At the same time, PBM incorporates techniques from AI to ensure that the resulting beliefs are coherent and consistent with the available information.

To develop PBM, we employed a mixed-methods approach that involved both theoretical and empirical components. The theoretical component involved the development of a formal framework for probabilistic belief maintenance, which was based on a combination of probability theory and AI techniques. The empirical component involved the implementation and evaluation of PBM using a range of benchmark datasets and scenarios.

Our results show that PBM outperforms existing belief maintenance systems in terms of accuracy, coherence, and computational efficiency. Specifically, we found that PBM was able to maintain accurate and coherent beliefs in a wide range of scenarios, including those involving uncertain and incomplete information. We also observed that PBM was computationally more efficient than existing systems, particularly in scenarios involving large amounts of data.

The implications of our work are significant, as they suggest that PBM has the potential to be a general-purpose solution for belief maintenance across various domains. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of applications, including decision support systems, expert systems, and natural language processing. Furthermore, PBM can be used to develop more sophisticated and robust AI systems that are capable of handling complex and uncertain information.

One of the key contributions of our work is the development of a probabilistic framework for belief maintenance that is grounded in probability theory. This framework provides a rigorous and mathematically sound basis for representing and updating beliefs, which is essential for ensuring the accuracy and coherence of the resulting beliefs. Our framework also incorporates techniques from AI, such as reasoning under uncertainty and non-monotonic reasoning, which are essential for handling complex and dynamic information.

The symmetry algebras of certain families of quantum spin chains are considered in detail. The ","The symmetry algebras of certain families of quantum spin chains are considered in detail. The simplest examples possess m states per site (m\geq2), with nearest-neighbor interactions with U(m) symmetry, under which the sites transform alternately along the chain in the fundamental m and its conjugate representation \bar{m}. We find that these spin chains, even with {\em arbitrary} coefficients of these interactions, have a symmetry algebra A_m much larger than U(m), which implies that the energy eigenstates fall into sectors that for open chains (i.e., free boundary conditions) can be labeled by j=0, 1, >..., L, for the 2L-site chain, such that the degeneracies of all eigenvalues in the jth sector are generically the same and increase rapidly with j. For large j, these degeneracies are much larger than those that would be expected from the U(m) symmetry alone. The enlarged symmetry algebra A_m(2L) consists of operators that commute in this space of states with the Temperley-Lieb algebra that is generated by the set of nearest-neighbor interaction terms; A_m(2L) is not a Yangian. There are similar results for supersymmetric chains with gl(m+n|n) symmetry of nearest-neighbor interactions, and a richer representation structure for closed chains (i.e., periodic boundary conditions). The symmetries also apply to the loop models that can be obtained from the spin chains in a spacetime or transfer matrix picture. In the loop language, the symmetries arise because the loops cannot cross. We further define tensor products of representations (for the open chains) by joining chains end to end. The fusion rules for decomposing the tensor product of representations labeled j_1 and j_2 take the same form as the Clebsch-Gordan series for SU(2). This and other structures turn the symmetry algebra \cA_m into a ribbon Hopf algebra, and we show that this is ``Morita equivalent'' to the quantum group U_q(sl_2) for m=q+q^{-1}. The open-chain results are extended to the cases |m|< 2 for which the algebras are no longer semisimple; these possess continuum limits that are critical (conformal) field theories, or massive perturbations thereof. Such models, for open and closed boundary conditions, arise in connection with disordered fermions, percolation, and polymers (self-avoiding walks), and certain non-linear sigma models, all in two dimensions. A product operation is defined in a related way for the Temperley-Lieb representations also, and the fusion rules for this are related to those for A_m or U_q(sl_2) representations; this is useful for the continuum limits also, as we discuss in a companion paper.","(500, 14)","This paper explores the concept of enlarged symmetry algebras in the context of spin chains, loop models, and S-matrices. These algebras provide an extension of the usual symmetries of quantum systems, and have played a significant role in the study of integrable models.

We begin by reviewing the basics of the theory of symmetry algebras, and discuss the usual method for constructing them using commutation relations. We then introduce the notion of an enlarged symmetry algebra, which arises when additional generators are introduced that satisfy nontrivial commutation relations with the original ones. We show that, in some cases, these enlarged symmetry algebras can be built starting from a Lie algebra and a set of algebra automorphisms.

We then apply these ideas to the study of spin chains, which are one-dimensional arrays of spin-1/2 particles that are coupled according to a certain Hamiltonian. It is known that the symmetry algebra of a spin chain can be enlarged by introducing a set of additional generators that satisfy certain commutation relations with the original ones. We show that this enlarged symmetry algebra can be further extended by introducing additional mutually commuting generators that act nontrivially only on particular subsets of spin sites, leading to a hierarchy of symmetry algebras.

We also consider loop models, which are lattice models of statistical mechanics that describe the behavior of polymers and other long-chain molecules. We show that the symmetry algebra of a loop model can also be enlarged by introducing additional generators that act nontrivially on certain loops in the lattice. This leads to a rich structure of symmetries, which can be used to derive a variety of exact results for the model.

Finally, we discuss the connection between enlarged symmetry algebras and S-matrices, which provide a way to compute probabilities for particles to scatter off each other in a quantum system. We show that the symmetry algebra of a scattering matrix can also be enlarged by introducing additional generators that act nontrivially on certain parts of the Hilbert space. This leads to a deeper understanding of the symmetries of S-matrices, and can be used to derive exact results in some cases.

Overall, this paper demonstrates the importance of enlarged symmetry algebras in a variety of contexts in theoretical physics, and suggests new avenues for research in the study of integrable models.","(417, 15)","The symmetry algebras of certain families of quantum spin chains are considered in detail.

We review the status of searches for sterile neutrinos in the $\sim 1$ eV range, ","We review the status of searches for sterile neutrinos in the $\sim 1$ eV range, with an emphasis on the latest results from short baseline oscillation experiments and how they fit within sterile neutrino oscillation models. We present global fit results to a three-active-flavor plus one-sterile-flavor model (3+1), where we find an improvement of $\Delta \chi^2=35$ for 3 additional parameters compared to a model with no sterile neutrino. This is a 5$\sigma$ improvement, indicating that an effect that is like that of a sterile neutrino is highly preferred by the data. However we note that separate fits to the appearance and disappearance oscillation data sets within a 3+1 model do not show the expected overlapping allowed regions in parameter space. This ""tension"" leads us to explore two options: 3+2, where a second additional mass state is introduced, and a 3+1+decay model, where the $\nu_4$ state can decay to invisible particles. The 3+1+decay model, which is also motivated by improving compatibility with cosmological observations, yields the larger improvement, with a $\Delta \chi^2=8$ for 1 additional parameter beyond the 3+1 model, which is a $2.6\sigma$ improvement. Moreover the tension between appearance and disappearance experiments is reduced compared to 3+1, although disagreement remains. In these studies, we use a frequentist approach and also a Bayesean method of finding credible regions.

With respect to this tension, we review possible problems with the global fitting method. We note multiple issues, including problems with reproducing the experimental results, especially in the case of experiments that do not provide adequate data releases. We discuss an unexpected 5 MeV excess, observed in the reactor flux energy spectrum, that may be affecting the oscillation interpretation of the short baseline reactor data. We emphasize the care that must be taken in mapping to the true neutrino energy in the case of oscillation experiments that are subject to multiple interaction modes and nuclear effects.

We point to problems with the ""Parameter-Goodness-of-Fit test"" that is used to quantify the tension. Lastly, we point out that analyses presenting limits often receive less scrutiny that signals.

While we provide a snapshot of the status of sterile neutrino searches today and global fits to their interpretation, we emphasize that this is a fast-moving field. We briefly review experiments that are expected to report new data in the immediate future. Lastly, we consider the 5-year horizon, where we propose that decay-at-rest neutrino sources are the best method of finally resolving the confusing situation.","(465, 17)","The search for light sterile neutrinos has been one of the most persistent and intriguing endeavors in particle physics. Despite strong experimental constraints, the possibility of these elusive particles existing beyond the three known active neutrinos is still an open question. In this review, we examine the current status of the search for light sterile neutrinos in both short-baseline and long-baseline experiments.

A comprehensive analysis of short-baseline oscillation experiments shows that hints of sterile neutrino existence are persistent but not conclusive. The most conclusive indication comes from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) and MiniBooNE experiments, with a combined statistical significance of 6.1 sigma. However, these results are still controversial due to the absence of a consistent explanation within the Standard Model of particle physics.

Long-baseline experiments, mainly from accelerator-based neutrino experiments such as MINOS and T2K, show no evidence of light sterile neutrinos. These experiments set limits on the mixing angle of sterile neutrinos with active neutrinos, and the latest results have improved sensitivity to the so-called ""low-energy excess"" observed by the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments. An interesting observation is the tension between the results from short- and long-baseline experiments, which hints at new physics beyond the Standard Model.

The recent result from the DANSS experiment, using compact detectors, claims to have observed a hint of a sterile neutrino signal. However, this result is not yet confirmed by other experiments. Many other experiments are also looking for signals of light sterile neutrinos and will provide new results in the near future, including the SBN program and the upcoming DUNE experiment.

In summary, the existence of light sterile neutrinos is still an open question in the field of particle physics. The controversies surrounding the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments call for more experimental efforts, while the lack of evidence from long-baseline experiments imposes strict limits on the parameter space of sterile neutrinos. The observation of such a particle will have far-reaching implications for the current understanding of fundamental physics. Therefore, a continued and coordinated effort involving both long- and short-baseline experiments is required to make progress towards resolving the mystery of light sterile neutrinos.","(388, 16)","We review the status of searches for sterile neutrinos in the $\sim 1$ eV range,  which have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to explain anomalies in neutrino oscillation experiments. The existence of light sterile neutrinos would have profound implications for our understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics and the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry.

Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that do not interact via any of the fundamental forces except gravity, making them invisible to most detection methods. However, they could still participate in neutrino oscillations, which are the quantum mechanical phenomenon where a neutrino created with a specific flavor (electron, muon, or tau) can later be measured to have a different flavor.

Several experiments have reported anomalies that could be interpreted as evidence for light sterile neutrinos. For example, the LSND (Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector) experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory observed an excess of electron neutrino events that could not be explained by standard neutrino oscillations. Similarly, the MiniBooNE ( Booster Neutrino Beam) experiment at Fermilab has reported an excess of electron-like events that could be attributed to sterile neutrino oscillations.

To investigate these anomalies, we conducted a meta-analysis of existing data from various neutrino experiments, including LSND, MiniBooNE, and T2K (Tokai-to-Kamioka). We used a Bayesian approach to combine the results from these experiments, taking into account the systematic uncertainties and correlations between the measurements.

Our analysis reveals that the combined data from these experiments are consistent with the presence of a light sterile neutrino with a mass around 1 eV. However, we also find that the evidence for sterile neutrinos is not yet conclusive, and more data are needed to confirm or rule out this hypothesis.

The implications of our findings are far-reaching. If sterile neutrinos exist, they could provide a new window into the universe's early history, offering insights into the mechanisms that led to the formation of matter and the universe's large-scale structure. Moreover, the existence of sterile neutrinos could have significant implications for particle physics beyond the Standard Model, potentially leading to new discoveries and a deeper understanding of the universe's fundamental laws.

With the growing importance of corporate viral marketing campaigns on online social networks, the interest ","With the growing importance of corporate viral marketing campaigns on online social networks, the interest in studies of influence propagation through networks is higher than ever. In a viral marketing campaign, a firm initially targets a small set of pioneers and hopes that they would influence a sizeable fraction of the population by diffusion of influence through the network. In general, any marketing campaign might fail to go viral in the first try. As such, it would be useful to have some guide to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign and judge whether it is worthy of further resources, and in case the campaign has potential, how to hit upon a good pioneer who can make the campaign go viral. In this paper, we present a diffusion model developed by enriching the generalized random graph (a.k.a. configuration model) to provide insight into these questions. We offer the intuition behind the results on this model, rigorously proved in Blaszczyszyn & Gaurav(2013), and illustrate them here by taking examples of random networks having prototypical degree distributions - Poisson degree distribution, which is commonly used as a kind of benchmark, and Power Law degree distribution, which is normally used to approximate the real-world networks. On these networks, the members are assumed to have varying attitudes towards propagating the information. We analyze three cases, in particular - (1) Bernoulli transmissions, when a member influences each of its friend with probability p; (2) Node percolation, when a member influences all its friends with probability p and none with probability 1-p; (3) Coupon-collector transmissions, when a member randomly selects one of his friends K times with replacement. We assume that the configuration model is the closest approximation of a large online social network, when the information available about the network is very limited. The key insight offered by this study from a firm's perspective is regarding how to evaluate the effectiveness of a marketing campaign and do cost-benefit analysis by collecting relevant statistical data from the pioneers it selects. The campaign evaluation criterion is informed by the observation that if the parameters of the underlying network and the campaign effectiveness are such that the campaign can indeed reach a significant fraction of the population, then the set of good pioneers also forms a significant fraction of the population. Therefore, in such a case, the firms can even adopt the naive strategy of repeatedly picking and targeting some number of pioneers at random from the population. With this strategy, the probability of them picking a good pioneer will increase geometrically fast with the number of tries.","(479, 14)","Social networks play a crucial role in disseminating information, shaping opinions and behaviors, and propagating influence. Identifying the pioneers of influence propagation in social networks has been the subject of intense research in the past decade. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the seminal works and major contributions in the field of influence propagation in social networks.

We start by introducing the concept of influence and its different forms, such as social influence, informational influence, and normative influence. Then, we discuss the main models and algorithms used to quantify and predict influence propagation in social networks, including traditional network-based models such as Independent Cascade, Linear Threshold, and Generalized Linear Threshold, as well as more recent data-driven approaches such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Next, we review the most influential works in the field, highlighting their theoretical foundations, main contributions, and empirical evaluations. We divide the literature into three periods: the early period (before 2007), the middle period (2008-2013), and the recent period (2014-present). In each period, we identify the pioneers who made significant and lasting contributions to the field and discuss their works in detail.

In the early period, the pioneers focused mainly on developing models and algorithms for influence propagation, such as the seminal work by Kempe et al. (2003) on the Independent Cascade model and the work by Domingos and Richardson (2001) on the Markov Random Field model. In the middle period, the pioneers expanded the scope of the field by investigating various applications of influence propagation, such as viral marketing, political campaigns, and social movements, and by addressing new challenges such as privacy, security, and scalability. Examples of works by pioneers in this period include the work by Leskovec et al. (2007) on the influence maximization problem and the work by Anagnostopoulos et al. (2008) on the cost-effective viral marketing.

In the recent period, the pioneers shifted towards more data-driven approaches, leveraging the abundance of social media data and the recent advances in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Examples of works by pioneers in this period include the work by Banerjee et al. (2019) on using Deep Learning for predicting political influence and the work by Cui et al. (2019) on using Graph Neural Networks for modeling influence propagation.

Finally, we conclude by discussing some open challenges and future directions in the field of influence propagation in social networks, such as understanding the interplay between influence and homophily, dealing with misinformation and polarization, and accounting for dynamic and heterogeneous networks.","(488, 19)","With the growing importance of corporate viral marketing campaigns on online social networks, the interest  in understanding the dynamics of influence propagation within these networks has increased significantly. This paper aims to investigate the pioneers of influence propagation in social networks, focusing on their characteristics, behaviors, and impact on the spread of information. Our research question is: What are the key factors that distinguish pioneers from non-pioneers in social networks, and how do these factors influence the propagation of information?

To address this question, we employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. We collected data from a large-scale social network dataset, consisting of over 100,000 users and their interactions. We identified pioneers as users who were among the first to adopt a new product or service, and non-pioneers as users who adopted later. We then analyzed the characteristics of pioneers, including their demographic information, network structure, and behavioral patterns. We also conducted in-depth interviews with a subset of pioneers to gain a deeper understanding of their motivations and behaviors.

Our results show that pioneers exhibit distinct characteristics compared to non-pioneers. Pioneers tend to have a higher degree of centrality in the network, indicating that they are more connected to other users.

To address this question, we employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods.

During recent years, the renaissance of neural networks as the major machine learning paradigm and ","During recent years, the renaissance of neural networks as the major machine learning paradigm and more specifically, the confirmation that deep learning techniques provide state-of-the-art results for most of computer vision tasks has been shaking up traditional research in image processing. The same can be said for research in communities working on applied harmonic analysis, information geometry, variational methods, etc. For many researchers, this is viewed as an existential threat. On the one hand, research funding agencies privilege mainstream approaches especially when these are unquestionably suitable for solving real problems and for making progress on artificial intelligence. On the other hand, successful publishing of research in our communities is becoming almost exclusively based on a quantitative improvement of the accuracy of any benchmark task. As most of my colleagues sharing this research field, I am confronted with the dilemma of continuing to invest my time and intellectual effort on mathematical morphology as my driving force for research, or simply focussing on how to use deep learning and contributing to it. The solution is not obvious to any of us since our research is not fundamental, it is just oriented to solve challenging problems, which can be more or less theoretical. Certainly, it would be foolish for anyone to claim that deep learning is insignificant or to think that one's favourite image processing domain is productive enough to ignore the state-of-the-art. I fully understand that the labs and leading people in image processing communities have been shifting their research to almost exclusively focus on deep learning techniques. My own position is different: I do think there is room for progress on mathematically grounded image processing branches, under the condition that these are rethought in a broader sense from the deep learning paradigm. Indeed, I firmly believe that the convergence between mathematical morphology and the computation methods which gravitate around deep learning (fully connected networks, convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, recurrent neural networks, etc.) is worthwhile. The goal of this talk is to discuss my personal vision regarding these potential interactions. Without any pretension of being exhaustive, I want to address it with a series of open questions, covering a wide range of specificities of morphological operators and representations, which could be tackled and revisited under the paradigm of deep learning. An expected benefit of such convergence between morphology and deep learning is a cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between both fields. In addition, I think the future answer to some of these questions can provide some insight on understanding, interpreting and simplifying deep learning networks.","(469, 16)","In recent years, deep learning algorithms have become increasingly prevalent in a variety of fields ranging from computer vision to natural language processing. While deep learning has achieved remarkable success, there remain fundamental questions about how these models work and represent information. In particular, important questions still remain regarding the use of morphological operators in deep learning, and how they are able to represent complex shapes and structures.

Morphological operators are mathematical tools often used for image processing and analysis. This includes operations such as dilation, erosion, and opening and closing. These operations fundamentally transform the shape of an object, which makes them extremely useful for tasks such as image segmentation and object recognition. In the context of deep learning, morphological operations can be used as a building block for various architectures, such as morphological neural networks.

Despite the potential usefulness of morphological operators, several open questions remain regarding their use in deep learning. One important question is how morphological operators should be designed and integrated into deep learning models to achieve optimal performance. Another important question is how morphological operators can be used in conjunction with other deep learning tools such as convolutional neural networks.

Additionally, there remain open questions about how morphological operators can be used to represent complex shapes and structures. One approach is to represent objects as a set of morphological features, such as size and shape, and use these features to train a deep learning model. Another approach is to design deep learning models capable of directly manipulating and generating morphological representations of objects.

Despite the remaining open questions, recent research has shown promising results in using morphological operators in deep learning. For example, some studies have shown that incorporating morphological operations into neural networks can improve performance on tasks such as object detection and segmentation. Additionally, research on morphological neural networks has shown that they can achieve state-of-the-art results on certain image processing tasks.

In conclusion, while deep learning has achieved remarkable success, there remain important open questions about how morphological operators and representations can be used in conjunction with deep learning models.

In the context of unconstraint numerical optimization, this paper investigates the global linear convergence of ","In the context of unconstraint numerical optimization, this paper investigates the global linear convergence of a simple probabilistic derivative-free optimization algorithm (DFO). The algorithm samples a candidate solution from a standard multivariate normal distribution scaled by a step-size and centered in the current solution. This solution is accepted if it has a better objective function value than the current one. Crucial to the algorithm is the adaptation of the step-size that is done in order to maintain a certain probability of success. The algorithm, already proposed in the 60's, is a generalization of the well-known Rechenberg's $(1+1)$ Evolution Strategy (ES) with one-fifth success rule which was also proposed by Devroye under the name compound random search or by Schumer and Steiglitz under the name step-size adaptive random search. In addition to be derivative-free, the algorithm is function-value-free: it exploits the objective function only through comparisons. It belongs to the class of comparison-based step-size adaptive randomized search (CB-SARS). For the convergence analysis, we follow the methodology developed in a companion paper for investigating linear convergence of CB-SARS: by exploiting invariance properties of the algorithm, we turn the study of global linear convergence on scaling-invariant functions into the study of the stability of an underlying normalized Markov chain (MC). We hence prove global linear convergence by studying the stability (irreducibility, recurrence, positivity, geometric ergodicity) of the normalized MC associated to the $(1+1)$-ES. More precisely, we prove that starting from any initial solution and any step-size, linear convergence with probability one and in expectation occurs. Our proof holds on unimodal functions that are the composite of strictly increasing functions by positively homogeneous functions with degree $\alpha$ (assumed also to be continuously differentiable). This function class includes composite of norm functions but also non-quasi convex functions. Because of the composition by a strictly increasing function, it includes non continuous functions. We find that a sufficient condition for global linear convergence is the step-size increase on linear functions, a condition typically satisfied for standard parameter choices. While introduced more than 40 years ago, we provide here the first proof of global linear convergence for the $(1+1)$-ES with generalized one-fifth success rule and the first proof of linear convergence for a CB-SARS on such a class of functions that includes non-quasi convex and non-continuous functions. Our proof also holds on functions where linear convergence of some CB-SARS was previously proven, namely convex-quadratic functions (including the well-know sphere function).","(467, 16)","This paper considers the problem of optimizing a class of positively homogeneous functions using a comparison-based step-size adaptive randomized search algorithm. Specifically, we investigate the performance of the (1+1) evolutionary strategy with the generalized one-fifth success rule on this task. We demonstrate that under certain assumptions on the problem structure, the algorithm exhibits linear convergence to the optimum. Our analysis is based on a novel potential function approach which allows us to establish convergence bounds that hold with high probability. The potential function is constructed by introducing an auxiliary sequence which measures the expected improvement in the objective function as the algorithm progresses. We show that this sequence satisfies a recursive equation that can be used to derive upper bounds on the expected value of the potential function. By choosing appropriate parameters for the algorithm, we prove that the potential function converges to zero at a linear rate. This in turn implies linear convergence of the algorithm to the optimum. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments on a benchmark set of test functions. Our results show that the (1+1) evolutionary strategy with the generalized one-fifth success rule achieves significantly faster convergence rates compared to standard (1+1) evolutionary strategies without adaptive step sizes. Moreover, our method is shown to be competitive with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms on these test functions. Overall, our work provides new insights into the behaviour of randomized search algorithms on a class of structured optimization problems, and establishes a theoretical foundation for developing improved algorithms for a wide range of practical applications.","(283, 12)","In the context of unconstraint numerical optimization, this paper investigates the global linear convergence of  a comparison-based step-size adaptive randomized search algorithm, specifically the (1 + 1) Evolution Strategy (ES) with a generalized one-fifth success rule.

The (1+1)-ES is a simple yet powerful optimization algorithm that has been widely used in various fields due to its ease of implementation and robustness. However, its convergence properties, particularly in the context of positively homogeneous functions, have not been thoroughly explored. The generalized one-fifth rule is an adaptive step-size strategy that adjusts the step-size based on the number of successful iterations, providing a balance between exploration and exploitation.

The main research question addressed in this paper is whether the (1+ 1)-ES with the generalized one -fifth success rule can achieve global linear convergence on positively homogeneous functions. To answer this question, we employ a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. On the theoretical side, we derive a set of sufficient conditions under which the algorithm converges linearly to the global optimum. These conditions are based on the properties of positively homogeneous functions and the adaptive step-size strategy employed by the algorithm.

Our theoretical analysis reveals that the algorithm achieves global linear convergence if the objective function satisfies certain regularity conditions, such as Lipschitz continuity and positive homogeneity. Furthermore, we show that the convergence rate of the algorithm is directly related to the degree of positive homogeneity of the objective function. Specifically, we prove that the algorithm converges at a rate of O(1/t^(d+1)), where t is the iteration number and d is the dimension of the search space.

Background: Odd-odd nuclei, around doubly closed shells, have been extensively used to study proton-neutron interactions. ","Background: Odd-odd nuclei, around doubly closed shells, have been extensively used to study proton-neutron interactions. However, the evolution of these interactions as a function of the binding energy, ultimately when nuclei become unbound, is poorly known. The $^{26}$F nucleus, composed of a deeply bound $\pi0d\_{5/2}$ proton and an unbound $\nu0d\_{3/2}$ neutron on top of an $^{24}$O core, is particularly adapted for this purpose. The coupling of this proton and neutron results in a $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 - 4^{+}\_1$ multiplet, whose energies must be determined to study the influence of the proximity of the continuum on the corresponding proton-neutron interaction. The $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1, 2^{+}\_1,4^{+}\_1$ bound states have been determined, and only a clear identification of the $J^{\pi} =3^{+}\_1$ is missing.Purpose: We wish to complete the study of the $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 - 4^{+}\_1$ multiplet in $^{26}$F, by studying the energy and width of the $J^{\pi} =3^{+}\_1$ unbound state. The method was firstly validated by the study of unbound states in $^{25}$F, for which resonances were already observed in a previous experiment.Method: Radioactive beams of $^{26}$Ne and $^{27}$Ne, produced at about $440A$\,MeV by the FRagment Separator at the GSI facility, were used to populate unbound states in $^{25}$F and $^{26}$F via one-proton knockout reactions on a CH$\_2$ target, located at the object focal point of the R$^3$B/LAND setup. The detection of emitted $\gamma$-rays and neutrons, added to the reconstruction of the momentum vector of the $A-1$ nuclei, allowed the determination of the energy of three unbound states in $^{25}$F and two in $^{26}$F. Results: Based on its width and decay properties, the first unbound state in $^{25}$F is proposed to be a $J^{\pi} = 1/2^-$ arising from a $p\_{1/2}$ proton-hole state. In $^{26}$F, the first resonance at 323(33)~keV is proposed to be the $J^{\pi} =3^{+}\_1$ member of the $J^{\pi} = 1^{+}\_1 - 4^{+}\_1$ multiplet. Energies of observed states in $^{25,26}$F have been compared to calculations using the independent-particle shell model, a phenomenological shell-model, and the ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group method.Conclusions: The deduced effective proton-neutron interaction is weakened by about 30-40\% in comparison to the models, pointing to the need of implementing the role of the continuum in theoretical descriptions, or to a wrong determination of the atomic mass of $^{26}$F.","(619, 10)","The study of the proton-neutron interaction near the drip line has been of great interest in the field of nuclear physics. In this research paper, we investigate the effective interaction between protons and neutrons in the unbound states of the nuclides $^{25,26}$F.

Using the state-of-the-art experimental facilities at the m separator of the RIBF accelerator complex at RIKEN, we have successfully measured the energy levels and decay properties of $^{25,26}$F. Our results reveal a weakly bound d$_{5/2}$ neutron in $^{25}$F and a resonant p$_{3/2}$ proton in $^{26}$F, which are the key components for an effective interaction in these nuclei.

By analyzing the experimental data using the ab initio coupled-cluster theory, we have been able to extract the effective interaction between the protons and neutrons in $^{25,26}$F. Our calculations show that the effective interaction is strongly influenced by the presence of the unbound states near the drip line.

Furthermore, our results indicate that the effective interaction between the protons and neutrons in $^{26}$F is significantly enhanced compared to that in $^{25}$F. This suggests that the proton-neutron interaction near the drip line is highly dependent on the specific properties of the nuclide, and highlights the importance of studying the drip line region in nuclear physics.

In conclusion, this research paper presents a comprehensive study of the effective interaction between protons and neutrons near the drip line in $^{25,26}$F. Our experimental and theoretical results provide valuable insights into the nuclear properties of these nuclides, and shed light on the nature of the proton-neutron interaction in the drip line region.","(334, 10)","Background: Odd-odd nuclei, around doubly closed shells, have been extensively used to study proton-neutron interactions.  $^{25}$F and $^{26}$F, located near the neutron drip line, offer a unique opportunity to investigate the effective proton-neutron interaction due to the presence of unbound states.

Research Question: The primary objective of this study is to explore the proton-neutron interaction in the vicinity of the neutron drip line by analyzing the unbound states of $^{25, 26}$F.

Methodology: To achieve this goal, we employed a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. First, we conducted an experiment at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) using the BigRIPS separator to produce high-quality beams of $^{25}$ F and $^{26 }$F. Subsequently, we utilized the SAMURAI spectrometer to detect the decay products of these unbound states. Theoretical calculations were performed using the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model, coupled with the Gogny-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (G-HFB) approach, to describe the structure of the unbound states.

Findings: Our experimental results revealed the existence of unbound states in both $^{25 }$F and $^ {26}$F, which were not observed in previous studies. The AMD+G-HFB calculations successfully reproduced the experimental data, providing valuable insights into the proton-neutron interactions in these nuclei. Notably, the calculations indicated that the unbound states are primarily influenced by the proton-neutron pairing correlations, which play a crucial role in shaping the nuclear structure near the drip line.

Implications: The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of proton-neutron interactions near the drip line. The observation of unbound states and the importance of proton-neutron pairing in these nuclei suggest that the traditional shell model may not be sufficient to describe the nuclear structure in this region.

Research Question: The primary objective of this study is to explore the proton-neutron interaction in the vicinity of the neutron drip line by analyzing the unbound states of $^{25, 26}$F.

Methodology: To achieve this goal, we employed a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. First, we conducted an experiment at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) using the BigRIPS separator to produce high-quality beams of $^{25}$ F and $^{26 }$F. Subsequently, we utilized the SAMURAI spectrometer to detect the decay products of these unbound states. Theoretical calculations were performed using the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model, coupled with the Gogny-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (G-HFB) approach, to describe the structure of the unbound states.

Findings: Our experimental results revealed the existence of unbound states in both $^{25 }$F and $^ {26}$F, which were not observed in previous studies. The AMD+G-HFB calculations successfully reproduced the experimental data, providing valuable insights into the proton-neutron interactions in these nuclei. Notably, the calculations indicated that the unbound states are primarily influenced by the proton-neutron pairing correlations, which play a crucial role in shaping the nuclear structure near the drip line.

Implications: The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of proton-neutron interactions near the drip line. The observation of unbound states and the importance of proton-neutron pairing in these nuclei suggest that the traditional shell model may not be sufficient to describe the nuclear structure in this region. Instead, a more sophisticated approach, incorporating the effects of pairing correlations, is required to accurately predict the properties of these nuclei.

The e-learning systems are designed to provide an easy and constant access to educational resources ","The e-learning systems are designed to provide an easy and constant access to educational resources online. Indeed, E-learning systems have capacity to adapt content and learning process according to the learner profile. Adaptation techniques using advanced behavioral analysis mechanisms, called ""Learner Modeling"" or ""Profiling"". The latter require continuous tracking of the activities of the learner to identify gaps and strengths in order to tailor content to their specific needs or advise and accompany him during his apprenticeship. However, the disadvantage of these systems is that they cause learners' discouragement, for learners, alone with his screen loses its motivation to improve. Adding social extension to learning, to avoid isolation of learners and boost support and interaction between members of the learning community, was able to increase learner's motivation. However, the tools to facilitate social interactions integrated to E-learning platforms can be used for purposes other than learning. These needs, which can be educational, professional or personal, create a mixture of data from the private life and public life of learners. With the integration of these tools for e-learning systems and the growth of the amount of personal data stored in the databases of these latter, protecting the privacy of students becomes a major concern.

Indeed, the exchange of profiles between e-learning systems is done without the permission of their owners. Furthermore, the profiling behavior analysis currently represents a very cost-effective way to generate profits by selling these profiles advertising companies. Today, the right to privacy is threatened from all sides. In addition to the threat from pirates, the source of the most dangerous threats is that from service providers online that users devote a blind trust. Control and centralized data storage and access privileges that have suppliers are responsible for the threat. Our work is limited to the protection of personal data in e-learning systems. We try to answer the question: How can we design a system that protects the privacy of users against threats from the provider while benefiting from all the services, including analysis of behavior? In the absence of solutions that take into account the protection and respect of privacy in e-learning systems that integrate social learning tools, we designed our own solution. Our ""ApprAide"" system uses a set of protocols based on security techniques to protect users' privacy. In addition, our system incorporates tools that promote social interactions as a social learning network, a chat tool and a virtual table. Our solution allows the use of adaptation techniques and profiling to assist learners.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to privacy protection based on the use of intelligent agents in e-learning systems.

Our method involves the deployment of agents that interact with users and monitor their activities, detecting potential threats and taking corrective actions as needed. These agents are designed to be autonomous and adaptive, capable of learning from user behavior and adjusting their strategies accordingly. The approach is based on a hierarchical model of privacy levels that takes into account the sensitivity of different types of data and the rights of users to control the flow of information.

We apply this method to a prototype e-learning system and evaluate its effectiveness through a series of experiments and user surveys. Our results show that the use of intelligent agents can significantly improve privacy protection in e-learning environments, providing users with greater control over their personal information and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

The proposed approach has several advantages over traditional methods of privacy protection. It is more flexible and adaptive, able to respond quickly to changing threats and user needs. It also reduces the burden on system administrators, who can delegate many tasks to the intelligent agents. Finally, it is more transparent and user-friendly, providing clear and understandable feedback to users about the protection of their privacy.

We conclude that the use of intelligent agents in e-learning systems offers a promising new approach to privacy protection, one that takes advantage of advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Further research is needed to explore the potential of this approach in other contexts, and to address the technical and ethical challenges that arise in the deployment of intelligent agents for privacy protection.","(332, 13)","The e-learning systems are designed to provide an easy and constant access to educational resources 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The fundamental plane of early-type galaxies is a rather tight three-parameter correlation discovered more than ","The fundamental plane of early-type galaxies is a rather tight three-parameter correlation discovered more than twenty years ago. It has resisted a both global and precise physical interpretation despite a consequent number of works, observational, theoretical or using numerical simulations. It appears that its precise properties depend on the population of galaxies in study. Instead of selecting a priori these populations, we propose to objectively construct homologous populations from multivariate analyses. We have undertaken multivariate cluster and cladistic analyses of a sample of 56 low-redshift galaxy clusters containing 699 early-type galaxies, using four parameters: effective radius, velocity dispersion, surface brightness averaged over effective radius, and Mg2 index. All our analyses are consistent with seven groups that define separate regions on the global fundamental plane, not across its thickness. In fact, each group shows its own fundamental plane, which is more loosely defined for less diversified groups. We conclude that the global fundamental plane is not a bent surface, but made of a collection of several groups characterizing several fundamental planes with different thicknesses and orientations in the parameter space. Our diversification scenario probably indicates that the level of diversity is linked to the number and the nature of transforming events and that the fundamental plane is the result of several transforming events. We also show that our classification, not the fundamental planes, is universal within our redshift range (0.007 - 0.053). We find that the three groups with the thinnest fundamental planes presumably formed through dissipative (wet) mergers. In one of them, this(ese) merger(s) must have been quite ancient because of the relatively low metallicity of its galaxies, Two of these groups have subsequently undergone dry mergers to increase their masses. In the k-space, the third one clearly occupies the region where bulges (of lenticular or spiral galaxies) lie and might also have formed through minor mergers and accretions. The two least diversified groups probably did not form by major mergers and must have been strongly affected by interactions, some of the gas in the objects of one of these groups having possibly been swept out. The interpretation, based on specific assembly histories of galaxies of our seven groups, shows that they are truly homologous. They were obtained directly from several observables, thus independently of any a priori classification. The diversification scenario relating these groups does not depend on models or numerical simulations, but is objectively provided by the cladistic analysis. Consequently, our classification is more easily compared to models and numerical simulations, and our work can be readily repeated with additional observables.","(477, 18)","The fundamental plane is a well-known empirical relationship that links the luminosity, the size, and the velocity dispersion of early-type galaxies. Despite the existence of this correlation for more than two decades, its physical origin remains an open question. Thanks to deep multi-band imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, and extensive stellar population analysis, we present new insights into the fundamental plane and its underlying structures. Using a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Keck observatories, we found evidence for the presence of structural deviations from the fundamental plane, which we interpret as orthogonally-oriented, disk-like structures embedded within the spheroidal component. We argue that these structures result from recent or ongoing gas accretion, and could provide fuel for both central supermassive black holes and galactic star formation. Interestingly, our results suggest that these structures are ubiquitous in early-type galaxies across a wide range of masses, luminosities, and environments, which implies that they carry fundamental information that cannot be neglected in theories of galaxy formation and evolution.

To further investigate these deviations from the fundamental plane, we used a robust statistical framework to derive quantitative measurements of their orientation, geometry, and amplitude. We found that the disk-like structures are typically flat and have a thickness that is only a few percent of the galaxies' effective radii. Their orientation distribution deviates significantly from random, indicating that they are truly aligned with the plane of the sky rather than being randomly oriented with respect to the line of sight. We found a strong correlation between the amplitude of the structure and the age of the galaxy's stellar population, with older galaxies having weaker or absent structures. This suggests that the disks dissipate over time, leaving behind a more spheroidal, ""classical"" morphology.

Our findings have important implications for the understanding of early-type galaxy formation and evolution. They provide new evidence for the role of gas accretion in shaping the structures and kinematics of these galaxies and suggest that the traditional view of early-type galaxies as purely spheroidal systems needs to be revisited. We anticipate that these results will inspire new theoretical models and numerical simulations that aim to account for the formation and evolution of these intriguing structures within the broader framework of galaxy formation.","(413, 14)","The fundamental plane of early-type galaxies is a rather tight three-parameter correlation discovered more than 30 years ago, which relates the effective radius, central velocity dispersion, and mean surface brightness of these galaxies.

Our sample consists of 100 early-type galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) surveys. We use a combination of photometric and spectroscopic data to determine the structural parameters of these galaxies, including their effective radii, central velocity dispersions, mean surface brightnesses, and Sérsic indices. Our analysis focuses on the distribution of these parameters within the fundamental plane, as well as their correlations with other galaxy properties.

We find that the distribution of early-type galaxies within the fundamental plane is more complex than previously thought. While the majority of galaxies follow the expected tight correlation, a significant number of objects deviate from this relation, forming distinct subpopulations. These subpopulations are characterized by different structural properties, such as larger effective radii, higher Sérsic indices, and lower mean surface brightnesses. Our results suggest that these subpopulations may be related to different stages of galaxy evolution, with the more deviant objects potentially representing younger or more dynamically disturbed systems.

We also investigate the correlations between the structural parameters of early-type galaxies and other galaxy properties, such as their stellar masses, star formation rates, and gas fractions. Our analysis reveals several interesting trends, including a positive correlation between the Sérsic index and stellar mass, as well as a negative correlation between the mean surface brightness and star formation rate. These findings suggest that the structural evolution of early-type galaxies may be influenced by a combination of internal and external factors, including mergers, gas accretion, and environmental effects.

The implications of our results are far-reaching, with potential consequences for our understanding of galaxy evolution and the formation of structure in the universe.

This article is dedicated to the late Giorgio Israel. R{\'e}sum{\'e}. The aim of this article ","This article is dedicated to the late Giorgio Israel. R{\'e}sum{\'e}. The aim of this article is to propose on the one hand a brief history of modeling starting from the works of Fibonacci, Robert Malthus, Pierre Francis Verhulst and then Vito Volterra and, on the other hand, to present the main hypotheses of the very famous but very little known predator-prey model elaborated in the 1920s by Volterra in order to solve a problem posed by his son-in-law, Umberto D'Ancona. It is thus shown that, contrary to a widely-held notion, Volterra's model is realistic and his seminal work laid the groundwork for modern population dynamics and mathematical ecology, including seasonality, migration, pollution and more. 1. A short history of modeling 1.1. The Malthusian model.

If the rst scientic view of population growth seems to be that of Leonardo Fibonacci [2], also called Leonardo of Pisa, whose famous sequence of numbers was presented in his Liber abaci (1202) as a solution to a population growth problem, the modern foundations of population dynamics clearly date from Thomas Robert Malthus [20]. Considering an ideal population consisting of a single homogeneous animal species, that is, neglecting the variations in age, size and any periodicity for birth or mortality, and which lives alone in an invariable environment or coexists with other species without any direct or indirect inuence, he founded in 1798, with his celebrated claim Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio, the paradigm of exponential growth. This consists in assuming that the increase of the number N (t) of individuals of this population, during a short interval of time, is proportional to N (t). This translates to the following dierential equation : (1) dN (t) dt = $\epsilon$N (t) where $\epsilon$ is a constant factor of proportionality that represents the growth coe-cient or growth rate. By integrating (1) we obtain the law of exponential growth or law of Malthusian growth (see Fig. 1). This law, which does not take into account the limits imposed by the environment on growth and which is in disagreement with the actual facts, had a profound inuence on Charles Darwin's work on natural selection. Indeed, Darwin [1] founded the idea of survival of the ttest on the 1. According to Frontier and Pichod-Viale [3] the correct terminology should be population kinetics, since the interaction between species cannot be represented by forces. 2. A population is dened as the set of individuals of the same species living on the same territory and able to reproduce among themselves.","(508, 18)","The predator-prey model is a common framework for analyzing the population dynamics of interacting species. The model originated from Vito Volterra's seminal work in 1926. In this paper, we investigate a paradoxical behavior of Volterra's model that has puzzled researchers for decades. On one hand, the model predicts that predator and prey populations should oscillate around a stable equilibrium. This prediction has been supported by empirical evidence from many different ecosystems. On the other hand, the model also predicts that predator and prey populations can exhibit chaotic behavior under certain parameter regimes. This prediction contradicts the intuition that ecosystems are stable and predictable.

Our research addresses the following questions: why does the predator-prey model exhibit chaotic behavior, and what are the implications of this paradox for understanding ecosystem dynamics? To answer these questions, we use mathematical techniques from the field of dynamical systems theory. We show that the chaotic behavior of the predator-prey model arises from a phenomenon known as ""strange attractors."" Strange attractors are complex patterns in phase space that result from the nonlinearity of the model equations. These patterns are characteristic of chaotic systems and underlie the unpredictable behavior of the model.

Despite the chaotic behavior of the predator-prey model, we find that it is still a useful framework for understanding ecosystem dynamics. In particular, the model can capture the idea of ""ecosystem resilience,"" which refers to the ability of a system to recover from disturbances. We show that ecosystems with chaotic dynamics can be more resilient than those with stable dynamics. This finding has implications for conservation biology and ecosystem management, as it suggests that efforts to stabilize ecosystems may be counterproductive.

In conclusion, our research sheds light on the paradoxical behavior of the predator-prey model and its implications for understanding ecosystem dynamics. We show that the chaotic behavior of the model arises from strange attractors and that it can have positive implications for ecosystem resilience. Our findings suggest that the predator-prey model remains a valuable tool for ecologists and conservationists, even in the face of nonlinear and unpredictable dynamics.","(380, 19)","This article is dedicated to the late Giorgio Israel.

The purpose of this paper is to present for the first time an elementary summary ","The purpose of this paper is to present for the first time an elementary summary of a few recent results obtained through the application of the formal theory of partial differential equations and Lie pseudogroups in order to revisit the mathematical foundations of general relativity. Other engineering examples (control theory, elasticity theory, electromagnetism) will also be considered in order to illustrate the three fundamental results that we shall provide. The paper is therefore divided into three parts corresponding to the different formal methods used. 1) CARTAN VERSUS VESSIOT: The quadratic terms appearing in the "" Riemann tensor "" according to the "" Vessiot structure equations "" must not be identified with the quadratic terms appearing in the well known "" Cartan structure equations "" for Lie groups and a similar comment can be done for the "" Weyl tensor "". In particular, "" curvature+torsion"" (Cartan) must not be considered as a generalization of ""curvature alone"" (Vessiot). Roughly, Cartan and followers have not been able to "" quotient down to the base manifold "", a result only obtained by Spencer in 1970 through the ""nonlinear Spencer sequence"" but in a way quite different from the one followed by Vessiot in 1903 for the same purpose and still ignored. 2) JANET VERSUS SPENCER: The "" Ricci tensor "" only depends on the nonlinear transformations (called "" elations "" by Cartan in 1922) that describe the ""difference "" existing between the Weyl group (10 parameters of the Poincar\'e subgroup + 1 dilatation) and the conformal group of space-time (15 parameters). It can be defined by a canonical splitting, that is to say without using the indices leading to the standard contraction or trace of the Riemann tensor. Meanwhile, we shall obtain the number of components of the Riemann and Weyl tensors without any combinatoric argument on the exchange of indices. Accordingly, the Spencer sequence for the conformal Killing system and its formal adjoint fully describe the Cosserat/Maxwell/Weyl theory but General Relativity is not coherent at all with this result. 3) ALGEBRAIC ANALYSIS: Contrary to other equations of physics (Cauchy equations, Cosserat equations, Maxwell equations), the Einstein equations cannot be "" parametrized "", that is the generic solution cannot be expressed by means of the derivatives of a certain number of arbitrary potential-like functions, solving therefore negatively a 1000 $ challenge proposed by J. Wheeler in 1970. Accordingly, the mathematical foundations of mathematical physics must be revisited within this formal framework, though striking it may look like for certain apparently well established theories such as electromagnetism and general relativity. We insist on the fact that the arguments presented are of a purely mathematical nature and are thus unavoidable.","(502, 13)","The theory of general relativity is one of the most significant scientific discoveries of modern times. It is a beautiful and elegant theory that describes the universe and the laws of gravity in a way that no other theory has been able to do. However, despite its success, there are still questions that remain unanswered about the mathematical foundations on which it is built.

In this paper, we revisit the mathematical foundations of general relativity and explore the areas where there are gaps in our understanding. We begin by reviewing the fundamental principles of the theory and the mathematical equations used to describe the behavior of matter and energy in the presence of gravity. We then look at the limitations of the current mathematical framework and explore how these limitations have led researchers to develop new approaches to modeling relativistic systems.

One of the key areas where our understanding of the mathematical foundations of general relativity is lacking is in the area of singularities. Singularities are points in space-time where the equations used to describe the behavior of matter and energy become infinite. While singularities are predicted by general relativity, it is unclear what they mean physically and whether they represent a fundamental limitation of the theory.

Another area where we need to improve our understanding of the mathematical foundations of general relativity is in the description of black holes. Black holes are regions of space-time where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Our current model of black holes depends on the presence of singularities, and it is unclear how they can be described mathematically without the use of singularities.

Despite these limitations, general relativity remains one of the most successful theories in physics and has been instrumental in our understanding of the universe. However, as scientists continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge, it is essential that we revisit the mathematical foundations of general relativity and explore new approaches that can help us better understand the universe around us. This paper aims to contribute to this ongoing effort and provide new insights into the mathematical foundations of one of the most fundamental theories in physics.","(387, 15)","The purpose of this paper is to present for the first time an elementary summary  of the mathematical foundations of Einstein's general theory of relativity.

However, despite its profound impact on modern physics, the mathematical underpinnings of general relativity remain poorly understood by many physicists and mathematicians.

This paper aims to address this knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the mathematical framework that supports general relativity. We begin by reviewing the fundamental concepts of differential geometry, including Riemannian manifolds, Christoffel symbols, and the Levi-Civita connection. These concepts form the basis of the mathematical description of spacetime in general relativity, and a thorough understanding of them is essential for any serious study of the subject.

We then proceed to discuss the Einstein field equations, which are the core of general relativity. These equations describe how the curvature of spacetime is related to the distribution of mass and energy in the universe. We provide a detailed derivation of the Einstein field equations using the language of differential geometry, and demonstrate how they can be used to describe a wide range of phenomena, from the bending of light around massive objects to the behavior of black holes.

One of the key features of general relativity is its ability to predict the existence of gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that are produced by violent cosmic events, such as the collision of two black holes. We discuss the mathematical formalism that underlies the prediction of gravitational waves, and show how it can be used to make precise predictions about the properties of these waves.

In addition to its applications to cosmology and astrophysics, general relativity has also had a profound impact on our understanding of the nature of space and time.

Recently Wilson [Ann. Appl. Probab. 14 (2004) 274--325] introduced an important new technique for lower ","Recently Wilson [Ann. Appl. Probab. 14 (2004) 274--325] introduced an important new technique for lower bounding the mixing time of a Markov chain.

In this paper we extend Wilson's technique to find lower bounds of the correct order for card shuffling Markov chains where at each time step a random card is picked and put at the top of the deck. Two classes of such shuffles are addressed, one where the probability that a given card is picked at a given time step depends on its identity, the so-called move-to-front scheme, and one where it depends on its position. For the move-to-front scheme, a test function that is a combination of several different eigenvectors of the transition matrix is used. A general method for finding and using such a test function, under a natural negative dependence condition, is introduced. It is shown that the correct order of the mixing time is given by the biased coupon collector's problem corresponding to the move-to-front scheme at hand. For the second class, a version of Wilson's technique for complex-valued eigenvalues/eigenvectors is used. Such variants were presented in [Random Walks and Geometry (2004) 515--532] and [Electron. Comm. Probab. 8 (2003) 77--85].

Here we present another such variant which seems to be the most natural one for this particular class of problems. To find the eigenvalues for the general case of the second class of problems is difficult, so we restrict attention to two special cases. In the first case the card that is moved to the top is picked uniformly at random from the bottom $k=k(n)=o(n)$ cards, and we find the lower bound $(n^3/(4\pi^2k(k-1)))\log n$. Via a coupling, an upper bound exceeding this by only a factor 4 is found. This generalizes Wilson's [Electron. Comm.

Probab. 8 (2003) 77--85] result on the Rudvalis shuffle and Goel's [Ann. Appl.

Probab. 16 (2006) 30--55] result on top-to-bottom shuffles. In the second case the card moved to the top is, with probability 1/2, the bottom card and with probability 1/2, the card at position $n-k$. Here the lower bound is again of order $(n^3/k^2)\log n$, but in this case this does not seem to be tight unless $k=O(1)$. What the correct order of mixing is in this case is an open question.

We show that when $k=n/2$, it is at least $\Theta(n^2)$.","(503, 29)","Biased random-to-top shuffling refers to a popular method to randomize a given sequence of elements. The method proceeds as follows: for each element in the sequence, choose a random number, and then place the element at the top of the sequence if the random number is greater than a certain threshold. The threshold is typically set to a fixed value or calculated based on some statistical measure of the sequence.

Despite its simplicity and widespread usage, the biased random-to-top shuffling method has received little attention in the literature. This is partly due to the fact that it is difficult to analyze and understand the behavior of the method. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of biased random-to-top shuffling, focusing on the following aspects:

- The statistical properties of the shuffled sequence.

- The computational complexity of the method, including its time and space requirements.

- The sensitivity of the method to the choice of threshold value and random number generator.

- The effectiveness of the method in preserving certain structures and properties of the input sequence, such as order, periodicity, and statistical distribution.

To achieve these goals, we conduct a series of experiments and simulations on various types of sequences, including random, structured, and real-world data sets. We analyze the results using statistical and visualization techniques, and provide insights into the behavior and performance of biased random-to-top shuffling.

Our main findings are as follows. Firstly, biased random-to-top shuffling tends to produce sequences that are more uniform and less correlated than the input sequence, especially when the threshold value is close to 0.5. This property can be useful in many applications that require randomization or sampling from a given sequence. Secondly, the computational complexity of the method is linear in the size of the sequence, but can be reduced by using appropriate data structures and algorithms. Thirdly, the choice of threshold value and random number generator can have a significant impact on the quality and randomness of the shuffled sequence, and should be carefully selected based on the application requirements. Finally, biased random-to-top shuffling is more effective in preserving certain structures and properties of the input sequence than other shuffling methods, such as random, fisher-yates, and block shuffling.

In conclusion, biased random-to-top shuffling is a simple and efficient method to randomize a given sequence, and has many interesting properties and applications. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of this method, and can serve as a basis for further research and development in this area.","(463, 19)","Recently Wilson [Ann. Appl. Probab. 14 (2004) 274--325] introduced an important new technique for lower  bounding the mixing time of a random walk on a graph. This technique, known as the ""random-to-top shuffling"" (RTS) method, has since been applied to a wide range of problems in computer science and mathematics. However, despite its widespread adoption, the RTS method has been criticized for its potential bias towards certain types of graphs. In particular, it has been observed that the RTS method tends to overestimate the mixing time of graphs with certain structural properties.

In this paper, we address this criticism by introducing a new variant of the RTS method, which we call ""biased random-to- top shuffling"" (BRTS). The BRTS method is designed to mitigate the bias inherent in the original RTS method, while still retaining its computational efficiency and ease of implementation. Our main contribution is a rigorous analysis of the BRTS method, which shows that it produces unbiased estimates of the mixing time for a wide range of graphs.

The BRTS method works as follows. Given a graph G = (V, E), we first select a random vertex v ∈ V as the ""top"" vertex. We then randomly permute the remaining vertices in V \ {v} to obtain a new ordering of the vertices. Finally, we apply the standard RTS method to the permuted graph to obtain an estimate of the mixing time. The key innovation of the BRS method is the use of a biased random permutation, which is designed to counteract the bias introduced by the original RTS method.

To analyze the BRS method, we employ a combination of combinatorial and probabilistic techniques. We first show that the biased random permutation used in the BRS method has a number of desirable properties, including symmetry and reversibility. We then use these properties to derive a closed-form expression for the expected value of the mixing time estimate produced by the BRS method.

Scaling temporal dynamics in functional MRI (fMRI) signals have been evidenced for a decade as ","Scaling temporal dynamics in functional MRI (fMRI) signals have been evidenced for a decade as intrinsic characteristics of ongoing brain activity (Zarahn et al., 1997). Recently, scaling properties were shown to fluctuate across brain networks and to be modulated between rest and task (He, 2011): notably, Hurst exponent, quantifying long memory, decreases under task in activating and deactivating brain regions. In most cases, such results were obtained: First, from univariate (voxelwise or regionwise) analysis, hence focusing on specific cognitive systems such as Resting-State Networks (RSNs) and raising the issue of the specificity of this scale-free dynamics modulation in RSNs. Second, using analysis tools designed to measure a single scaling exponent related to the second order statistics of the data, thus relying on models that either implicitly or explicitly assume Gaussianity and (asymptotic) self-similarity, while fMRI signals may significantly depart from those either of those two assumptions (Ciuciu et al., 2008; Wink et al., 2008). To address these issues, the present contribution elaborates on the analysis of the scaling properties of fMRI temporal dynamics by proposing two significant variations. First, scaling properties are technically investigated using the recently introduced Wavelet Leader-based Multifractal formalism (WLMF; Wendt et al., 2007). This measures a collection of scaling exponents, thus enables a richer and more versatile description of scale invariance (beyond correlation and Gaussianity), referred to as multifractality. Also, it benefits from improved estimation performance compared to tools previously used in the literature. Second, scaling properties are investigated in both RSN and non-RSN structures (e.g., artifacts), at a broader spatial scale than the voxel one, using a multivariate approach, namely the Multi-Subject Dictionary Learning (MSDL) algorithm (Varoquaux et al., 2011) that produces a set of spatial components that appear more sparse than their Independent Component Analysis (ICA) counterpart. These tools are combined and applied to a fMRI dataset comprising 12 subjects with resting-state and activation runs (Sadaghiani et al., 2009). Results stemming from those analysis confirm the already reported task-related decrease of long memory in functional networks, but also show that it occurs in artifacts, thus making this feature not specific to functional networks. Further, results indicate that most fMRI signals appear multifractal at rest except in non-cortical regions. Task-related modulation of multifractality appears only significant in functional networks and thus can be considered as the key property disentangling functional networks from artifacts. These finding are discussed in the light of the recent literature reporting scaling dynamics of EEG microstate sequences at rest and addressing non-stationarity issues in temporally independent fMRI modes.","(493, 14)","The study investigated the time dynamics of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals during rest and task using scale-free and multifractal analysis. We hypothesized that the temporal patterns of fMRI signals would exhibit scale-free and multifractal properties, and that these properties would differ between resting-state and task-related fMRI data.

To test our hypothesis, we analyzed fMRI data obtained from healthy participants during both resting-state and task conditions. The fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using standard procedures, including voxel-wise signal detrending, band-pass filtering, and spatial smoothing.

Our results revealed that the fMRI signals during both resting-state and task conditions exhibited scale-free and multifractal properties, indicating that these signals exhibit complex temporal properties across a wide range of timescales. Moreover, we found that the properties of these signals differed between resting-state and task-related fMRI data. Specifically, the scale-free and multifractal indices were higher in resting-state fMRI data than in task-related fMRI data, suggesting that the temporal dynamics of fMRI signals may be more complex during rest than during task performance.

These findings have important implications for our understanding of brain function and suggest that the temporal dynamics of fMRI signals are shaped by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In particular, our results suggest that the temporal properties of brain activity during rest and task may differ in important ways, and that these differences may reflect changes in the underlying neural processes that are active in these different states.

In summary, our study provides new insights into the scale-free and multifractal time dynamics of fMRI signals during rest and task, and sheds light on the complex patterns of brain activity that underlie cognitive function. Our findings have important implications for the development of new methods for the analysis of fMRI data, and may ultimately contribute to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for neurological and psychiatric disorders.","(334, 11)","Scaling temporal dynamics in functional MRI (fMRI) signals have been evidenced for a decade as 1/f noise. However, it remains unclear whether these dynamics are scale-free and multifractal during both rest and task conditions. This study aimed to investigate the scaling properties of fMRI signals during rest and task using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) and detrended moving average cross-correlation analysis (DMCA).

We collected fMRI data from 20 healthy subjects during rest and task conditions using a 3T MRI scanner. Data were preprocessed using standard fMRI analysis pipelines, including motion correction, slice timing correction, and spatial smoothing. We then applied MF-DFA and DMCA to the preprocessed data to analyze the scaling properties and multifractality of fMRI signals.

Our results showed that fMRI signals exhibited scale-free behavior during rest and task, with Hurst exponents (H) significantly greater than 0.5, indicating long-range correlations. Moreover, we found that fMRI signals were multifractal, with multifractal spectra (f(α)) showing a broad range of scaling exponents (α). The multifractality was more pronounced during task compared to rest, indicating a higher degree of complexity in task-related fMRI signals.

We also observed significant differences in the scaling properties between different brain regions, with the default mode network (DMN) exhibiting stronger long-range correlations and multifractality compared to the sensorimotor network (SMN). These findings suggest that the DMN may play a critical role in the integration of information across different brain regions, while the SMN may be more involved in the processing of sensory information.

Furthermore, we found that the scaling properties were significantly correlated with the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the fMRI signals. This suggests that the scaling properties may be related to the underlying neural mechanisms, such as synaptic plasticity and neural oscillations.

The implications of our findings are significant, as they suggest that fMRI signals may be used as a biomarker for various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. The multifractal analysis of fMRI signals may provide a more sensitive and specific measure of brain function compared to traditional methods, such as region-of-interest (ROI) analysis.

We present new ATCA 21-cm line observations of the neutral hydrogen in the nearby radio ","We present new ATCA 21-cm line observations of the neutral hydrogen in the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A. We image in detail (with a resolution down to 7"", ~100pc) the distribution of HI along the dust lane. Our data have better velocity resolution and better sensitivity than previous observations. The HI extends for a total of ~15kpc. The data, combined with a titled-ring model of the disk, allow to conclude that the kinematics of the HI is that of a regularly rotating, highly warped structure down to the nuclear scale. The parameters (in particular the inclination) of our model are somewhat different from some of the previously proposed models but consistent with what was recently derived from stellar light in a central ring. The model nicely describes also the morphology of the dust lane as observed with Spitzer. There are no indications that large-scale anomalies in the kinematics exist that could be related to supplying material for the AGN. Large-scale radial motions do exist, but these are only present at larger radii r>6kpc). This unsettled gas is mainly part of a tail/arm like structure. The relatively regular kinematics of the gas in this structure suggests that it is in the process of settling down into the main disk. The presence of this structure further supports the merger/interaction origin of the HI in Cen A. From the structure and kinematics we estimate a timescale of 1.6-3.2*10^{8}yr since the merging event. No bar structure is needed to describe the kinematics of the HI. The comparison of the timescale derived from the large-scale HI structure and those of the radio structure together with the relative regularity of the HI down to the sub-kpc regions does not suggest a one-to-one correspondence between the merger and the phase of radio activity. Interestingly, the radial motions of the outer regions are such that the projected velocities are redshifted compared to the regular orbits. This means that the blueshifted absorption discovered earlier and discussed in our previous paper cannot be caused by out-moving gas at large radius projected onto the centre. Therefore, the interpretation of the blueshifted absorption, together with at least a fraction of the redshifted nuclear absorption, as evidence for a regular inner disk, still holds. Finally, we also report the discovery of two unresolved clouds detected at 5.2 and 11kpc away (in projection) from the HI disk. They are likely an other example of left-over of the merger that brought the HI gas.","(457, 20)","The galaxy Centaurus A has long been a subject of interest for astronomers studying its morphology and kinematics. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the atomic hydrogen component of this galaxy using high-resolution data obtained from the Australia Telescope Compact Array.

Our observations reveal a complex structure for the neutral hydrogen gas in Centaurus A, with several distinct features that offer insight into the galaxy's formation and evolution. The most prominent of these features is a large-scale disk-like structure with a diameter of approximately 40 kpc, which is aligned with the optical disk of the galaxy. This disk is tilted with respect to the plane of the sky, which suggests it is not in a state of equilibrium.

In addition to the large-scale disk, we also observe several other structures that appear to be connected to it. These include two prominent spiral arms, as well as several filaments and loops. We propose that these structures may be the result of interactions between the galaxy and its environment, possibly including past mergers or interactions with nearby galaxies.

To further explore the kinematics of the atomic hydrogen in Centaurus A, we have analyzed the velocity field of the gas. Our results indicate that the velocity field is highly asymmetric, with significant deviations from a simple rotational pattern. Specifically, we observe large-scale warping and twisting of the velocity contours, which suggests the presence of non-circular motions.

We interpret these kinematic features as the result of ongoing interactions between the gas in Centaurus A and a surrounding medium, such as a hot halo or a tidal stream. We speculate that the interactions may be driving gas inflows toward the central regions of the galaxy, which could fuel the activity of the supermassive black hole at its core.

Overall, our observations of the atomic hydrogen in Centaurus A offer a detailed view of the morphology and kinematics of this complex galaxy. Our results provide new insights into the formation and evolution of Centaurus A, as well as the role of gas interactions in shaping the properties of galaxies more generally.","(379, 15)","We present new ATCA 21-cm line observations of the neutral hydrogen in the nearby radio  galaxy Centaurus A (NGC 5128), focusing on its morphology and kinematics. Our goal is to elucidate the complex interplay between the galaxy's central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM).

Our observations were conducted using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at a frequency of 1.372 GHz, which corresponds to a wavelength of 21.4 cm. This frequency range allows us to probe the neutral hydrogen (HI) gas in the galaxy, providing insights into its distribution, motion, and interaction with the SMBH. We used the MIRIAD software package to reduce and analyze the data, applying standard calibration and imaging techniques to produce high-quality maps of the HI emission.

Our results show that the HI gas in Centaurus A is distributed in a complex network of filaments and clouds, extending from the central bulge to the outer regions of the galaxy. The HI emission is strongest in the northwestern part of the galaxy, where it forms a prominent ring-like structure. We also detect a significant amount of HI gas in the southern region, which appears to be connected to the central bulge through a series of narrow filaments.

Our kinematic analysis reveals a complex velocity field, with gas motions ranging from -300 to +300 km/s. We identify several distinct kinematic components, including a rotating disk component, a non-rotating central component, and a series of high-velocity clouds. The rotating disk component shows a clear rotation curve, with a maximum velocity of approximately 200 km/s. In contrast, the non-rotating component is characterized by a flat velocity profile, suggesting that it is dynamically decoupled from the rest of the galaxy.

Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the galaxy's evolution and the role of the SMBH in shaping its ISM. The presence of a rotating disk component suggests that Centaurus A has undergone a significant amount of star formation and gas accretion in the past, which has contributed to the growth of the SMBH. The non-rotating center, on the other hand, may be a remnant of a previous merger event, which has left behind a dynamically decoupled component.

Language-oriented modularity (LOM) is a methodology that complements language-oriented programming (LOP) in providing on-demand language ","Language-oriented modularity (LOM) is a methodology that complements language-oriented programming (LOP) in providing on-demand language abstraction solutions during software development. It involves the implementation and immediate utilization of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that are also aspect-oriented (DSALs). However, while DSL development is affordable thanks to modern language workbenches, DSAL development lacks similar tool support.

Consequently, LOM is often impractical and underutilized. The challenge we address is making the complexity of DSAL implementation comparable to that of DSLs and the effectiveness of programming with DSALs comparable to that of general-purpose aspect languages (GPALs). Today, despite being essentially both domain-specific and aspect-oriented, DSALs seem to be second-class. Aspect development tools (e.g., AJDT) do not work on DSAL code. DSL development tools like language workbenches (e.g., Spoofax) neither deal with the backend weaving nor handle the composition of DSALs. DSAL composition frameworks (e.g., Awesome) do not provide frontend development tools. DSAL code transformation approaches (e.g., XAspects) do not preserve the semantics of DSAL programs in the presence of other aspect languages. We extend AspectJ with a small set of annotations and interfaces that allows DSAL designers to define a semantic-preserving transformation to AspectJ and interface with AspectJ tools.

Our transformation approach enables the use of standard language workbench to implement DSALs and use of standard aspect development tools to program with those DSALs. As a result, DSALs regain first-class status with respect to both DSLs and aspect languages. This, on the one hand, lowers the cost of developing DSALs to the level of DSLs and, on the other hand, raises the effectiveness of using a DSAL to the level of a GPAL. Consequently, LOM becomes cost-effective compared to the LOP baseline. We modified the ajc compiler to support our approach. Using two different language workbenches (Spoofax and Xtext) we then implemented several DSALs. AspectJ was supported out-of-the-box. We implemented Cool to demonstrate that the non-trivial composition of AspectJ and Cool can be accommodated using our approach. We applied LOM to crosscutting concerns in two open source projects (oVirt and muCommander), implementing in the process application-specific DSALs, thus providing a sense of the decrease in the cost of developing composable DSALs and the increase in the effectiveness of programming with them. Crosscutting concerns remain a problem in modern real-world projects (e.g., as observed in oVirt). DSALs are often the right tool for addressing these concerns. Our work makes LOM practical, thus facilitating use of DSAL solutions in the software development process.","(472, 23)","Modularity is an essential concept in computer science and software engineering, which promotes code organization, maintenance, and reuse. Considering the development of programming languages, the idea of modularity has become increasingly important due to its effect on code comprehension, scalability, and evolution. This paper aims to explore the intersection between modularity and language design, specifically by investigating Language Oriented Modularity (LOM) – a modularization principle that focuses on identifying and composing language constructs as reusable modules, which serve as the basic building blocks for larger-scale languages.

The first part of the paper outlines the theoretical foundation of LOM and its guiding principles. We describe the key elements of LOM, including modular syntax, semantic aspects, and the way it interacts with various programming paradigms. Additionally, the paper discusses how LOM helps developers to achieve a more flexible and efficient language design, better tailored to specific domains and user needs.

The second part of the paper provides an in-depth examination of practical aspects related to LOM in software development environments, including tool support, case studies, and real-world applications. We examine how LOM promotes better code reuse through language composition techniques such as meta-programming, language embedding, and domain-specific languages. We also discuss how LOM can address several challenges faced by software developers today, including software complexity, code generation, and language interoperability.

The paper concludes by highlighting the potential benefits of LOM for the software development community, including greater language extensibility, better code quality, and increased productivity. Moreover, the paper outlines some of the challenges and future directions of LOM, such as addressing issues related to language compatibility, providing adequate tool support and ensuring community participation in the development of modular languages.

In summary, this paper provides an overview of the Language Oriented Modularity principle, its theoretical foundation, and practical applications.

Context: CoRoT-2b is one of the most anomalously large exoplanet known. Given its large mass, ","Context: CoRoT-2b is one of the most anomalously large exoplanet known. Given its large mass, its large radius cannot be explained by standard evolution models. Interestingly, the planet's parent star is an active, rapidly rotating solar-like star with a large fraction (7 to 20%) of spots. Aims: We want to provide constraints on the properties of the star-planet system and understand whether the planet's inferred large size may be due to a systematic error on the inferred parameters, and if not, how it may be explained. Methods: We combine stellar and planetary evolution codes based on all available spectroscopic and photometric data to obtain self-consistent constraints on the system parameters. Results: We find no systematic error in the stellar modeling (including spots and stellar activity) that would yield the required ~10% reduction in size for the star and thus the planet. Two classes of solutions are found: the usual main sequence solution for the star yields for the planet a mass of 3.67+/-0.13 Mjup, a radius of 1.55+/-0.03 Rjup for an age that is at least 130Ma, and should be less than 500Ma given the star's fast rotation and significant activity. We identify another class of solutions on the pre-main sequence, in which case the planet's mass is 3.45\pm 0.27 Mjup, its radius is 1.50+/-0.06 Rjup for an age between 30 and 40 Ma. These extremely young solutions provide the simplest explanation for the planet's size which can then be matched by a simple contraction from an initially hot, expanded state, provided the atmospheric opacities are increased by a factor ~3 compared to usual assumptions for solar compositions atmospheres. Other solutions imply in any case that the present inflated radius of CoRoT-2b is transient and the result of an event that occurred less than 20 Ma ago: a giant impact with another Jupiter-mass planet, or interactions with another object in the system which caused a significant rise of the eccentricity followed by the rapid circularization of its orbit. Conclusions: Additional observations of CoRoT-2 that could help understanding this system include searches for infrared excess and the presence of a debris disk and searches for additional companions. The determination of a complete infrared lightcurve including both the primary and secondary transits would also be extremely valuable to constrain the planet's atmospheric properties and to determine the planet-to-star radius ratio in a manner less vulnerable to systematic errors due to stellar activity.","(444, 12)","The CoRoT-2 system is a target of great interest in exoplanet research, due to the young age of its host star, and the presence of an inflated giant planet. Our study presents a detailed analysis of this system, using data gathered by various instruments and techniques.

The host star, CoRoT-2, is a moderately active, young K-dwarf with a rotation period of 4.5 days, which is consistent with the presence of starspots on its surface. We identify several such spots using photometric variability and Doppler imaging, including a persistent spot at a high latitude which may be associated with a polar spot.

The giant planet, CoRoT-2b, is a highly inflated gas-giant with a radius of about 1.5 times that of Jupiter. Its mass and radius suggest a low density and a significant amount of hydrogen and helium in its atmosphere. We model the planet's structure and derive constraints on its composition and thermal structure. We also investigate the possibility of tidal heating as a source of internal energy.

We find that the spot distribution on the star is consistent with the expected pattern of a young, rapidly rotating star, with spots concentrated at high latitudes. The polar spot appears to be stable over time, which may be linked to the planet's close-in orbit and significant tidal forces.

We also investigate the dynamical evolution of the system, and the stability of the planet's orbit over long timescales. We find that the planet's current orbit is unlikely to be stable over the age of the system, and that it may have migrated inward from a more distant location. We discuss the possible processes that could have caused such migration, including planet-planet interactions, disk-planet interactions, and secular perturbations.

Overall, our study provides a detailed analysis of the CoRoT-2 system, which sheds light on the processes involved in the formation and evolution of giant planets around young stars. The young age of the system, and the presence of a highly inflated planet, make it a valuable target for further study with upcoming space telescopes, such as JWST and ARIEL.","(386, 15)","Context: CoRoT-2b is one of the most anomalously large exoplanet known.

Fermi can measure the spectral properties of gamma-ray bursts over a very large energy range ","Fermi can measure the spectral properties of gamma-ray bursts over a very large energy range and is opening a new window on the prompt emission of these energetic events. Localizations by the instruments on Fermi in combination with follow-up by Swift provide accurate positions for observations at longer wavelengths leading to the determination of redshifts, the true energy budget, host galaxy properties and facilitate comparison with pre-Fermi bursts.

Multi-wavelength follow-up observations were performed on the afterglows of four bursts with high energy emission detected by Fermi/LAT : GRB090323, GRB090328, GRB090510 and GRB090902B. They were obtained in the optical/near-infrared bands with GROND mounted at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope and additionally of GRB090323 in the optical with the 2 m telescope in Tautenburg, Germany. Three of the events are classified as long bursts while GRB090510 is a well localized short GRB with GeV emission. In addition, host galaxies were detected for three of the four bursts. Spectroscopic follow-up was initiated with the VLT for GRB090328 and GRB090510. The afterglow observations in 7 bands are presented for all bursts and their host galaxies are investigated. Knowledge of the distance and the local dust extinction enables comparison of the afterglows of LAT-detected GRBs with the general sample. The spectroscopic redshifts of GRB090328 and GRB090510 were determined to be z=0.7354+/-0.0003 and z=0.903 +/- 0.001 and dust corrected star-formation rates of 4.8 Mdot yr^-1 and 0.60 M_dot yr^-1 were derived for their host galaxies, respectively. The afterglows of long bursts exhibit power-law decay indices alpha from less than 1 to ~2.3 and spectral indices (beta) values from 0.65 to ~1.2 which are fairly standard for GRB afterglows. Constraints are placed on the jet half opening angles of less than 2.1 deg to greater than 6.4 deg which allows limits to be placed on the beaming corrected energies. These range from less than 5x10^50 erg to the one of the highest values ever recorded, greater than 2.2x10^52 erg for GRB090902B, and are not consistent with a standard candle. The extremely energetic long Fermi bursts have optical afterglows which lie in the top half of the brightness distribution of all optical afterglows detected in the Swift era or even in the top 5% if incompleteness is considered. The properties of the host galaxies of these LAT detected bursts in terms of extinction, star formation rates and masses do not appear to differ from previous samples.","(425, 15)","This paper presents the results of optical and near-infrared follow-up observations of four gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and their associated afterglows.

Our observations revealed the redshifts of the four GRBs, ranging from 0.25 to 1.3. The afterglows of the bursts were detected and monitored in the optical and near-infrared wavelengths, with their light curves analyzed to constrain the physical parameters of the GRB jets and the properties of their circumburst environments.

We found that the bursts had isotropic equivalent energies in the range of 10^50 to 10^52 ergs, indicating that they were among the most energetic cosmic explosions. The properties of the afterglows suggested they appeared to be consistent with the relativistic blast wave model, with the exception of one burst that showed unusual features.

Our study also probed the host galaxies of the GRBs, deriving their morphological types, star formation rates, and stellar masses. We found that the galaxies were typically faint and blue, consistent with the population of star-forming galaxies at high redshifts, and some showed evidence of ongoing star formation.

During a survey for stars with disks in the Taurus star-forming region using the Spitzer ","During a survey for stars with disks in the Taurus star-forming region using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have discovered a pair of young brown dwarfs, FU Tau A and B, in the Barnard 215 dark cloud. They have a projected angular separation of 5.7"", corresponding to 800 AU at the distance of Taurus. To assess the nature of these two objects, we have obtained spectra of them and have constructed their spectral energy distributions. Both sources are young (~1 Myr) according to their Halpha emission, gravity-sensitive spectral features, and mid-IR excess emission. The proper motion of FU Tau A provides additional evidence of its membership in Taurus. We measure spectral types of M7.25 and M9.25 for FU Tau A and B, respectively, which correspond to masses of ~0.05 and ~0.015 M\cdot according to the evolutionary models of Chabrier and Baraffe. FU Tau A is significantly overluminous relative to an isochrone passing through FU Tau B and relative to other members of Taurus near its spectral type, which may indicate that it is an unresolved binary. FU Tau A and B are likely to be components of a binary system based on the low probability (~3x10^-4) that Taurus would produce two unrelated brown dwarfs with a projected separation of a </- 6"". Barnard 215 contains only one other young star and is in a remote area of Taurus, making FU Tau A and B the first spectroscopically-confirmed brown dwarfs discovered forming in isolation rather than in a stellar cluster or aggregate. Because they were born in isolation and comprise a weakly bound binary, dynamical interactions with stars could not have played a role in their formation, and thus are not essential for the birth of brown dwarfs. ERRATUM: The K-band magnitude for FU Tau B in Table 1 is incorrect and should be 13.33. The bolometric luminosity of FU Tau B in Table 3 and Figure 5 is incorrect because of that mistake and a separate arithmetic error. The correct value of the luminosity is 0.0039 Lsun. FU Tau A and B exhibited different isochronal ages in the original Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in Figure 5, which was unexpected for members of a binary system. This discrepancy is reduced in the corrected version of Figure 5 since both objects are now above the isochrone for 1 Myr. Given the large uncertainties in model isochrones at such young ages, the positions of FU Tau A and B in Figure 5 could be roughly consistent with coevality.","(452, 16)","This study presents the discovery of a wide binary brown dwarf that was born in isolation. The object was found in the field of the Taurus star-forming region, and is unique in that it is located far from any known star-forming regions or clusters.

The brown dwarf was identified through multi-epoch imaging data obtained from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and the Gemini Observatory. The observations revealed that the object has a separation of 320 AU from its companion, which is also a brown dwarf.

Further analysis of the available data indicates that the two brown dwarfs have a projected physical separation of approximately 800 AU, which suggests that they were formed together and have been drifting apart since their birth. The estimated age of the brown dwarfs is around 10 million years.

The objects’ spectra were obtained using the Gemini North Telescope, and their spectral types were determined to be L4 and L5.5, respectively. Additional observations were conducted using the Keck Observatory, which yielded high-resolution spectra that provided characterization of the brown dwarfs’ atmospheric properties, such as metallicity, gravity, and effective temperature.

Based on the available data, the researchers speculate that the brown dwarfs were formed through a physical fragmentation process during the early stages of star formation, and were later ejected from their natal environment due to gravitational interactions with other newly formed stars or brown dwarfs.

The discovery of this wide binary brown dwarf is important for the understanding of the formation and evolution of objects that are not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion in their cores. This finding shows that brown dwarfs can be formed in isolation, far from any known star-forming regions or clusters, highlighting the importance of conducting wide-field surveys to increase our knowledge of these elusive objects.

The study also provides opportunities for further investigation of the atmospheric properties of the brown dwarfs. Future studies may reveal more detailed information on the evolution of these objects, which could have important implications for the understanding of the evolution of star and planet formation in our galaxy.

In conclusion, the discovery of a wide binary brown dwarf born in isolation provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of non-stellar objects, and underscores the importance of conducting wide-field surveys to uncover new and unique astronomical phenomena.","(415, 14)","During a survey for stars with disks in the Taurus star-forming region using the Spitzer 8-micron channel, we serendipitously discovered a wide binary brown dwarf system born in isolation. The system consists of two brown dwarfs with masses of approximately 15 and 20 Jupiter masses, separated by a projected distance of about 1000 AU. This discovery presents a unique opportunity to study the formation and evolution of brown dwarfs in isolation, providing insights into the processes that shape the properties of these enigmatic objects.

Our observations were conducted using the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) instruments. We employed a combination of photometric and spectroscopic techniques to determine the properties of the brown dwarfs, including their masses, temperatures, and luminosities. The data were reduced and analyzed using standard techniques, including aperture photometry and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting.

The results of our analysis indicate that the brown dwarf system is composed of two objects with effective temperatures of approximately 2500 K and 2800 K, respectively. The cooler object has a mass of about 15 Jupiters, while the hotter object has a mass around 20 Jupiters. The projected separation between the two brown dwarfs is estimated to be around 1000 AU, making this system one of the widest known binary brown dwarf systems.

Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of brown dwarf formation and evolution. The fact that this system was born in isolation suggests that brown dwarfs can form through the fragmentation of molecular clouds, rather than requiring the presence of a protostellar disk. This challenges current theories of brown dwarf formation, which often rely on the presence of a disk to explain the observed properties of these objects.

Furthermore, the properties of this system suggest that brown dwarfs may undergo significant mass loss during their early evolution, potentially leading to the formation of wide binary systems like the one we have discovered. This mass loss could be driven by strong winds or magnetic activity, which are thought to be common among brown dwarfs.

In addition to its implications for brown dwarf science, this discovery also highlights the importance of serendipitous observations in advancing our understanding of the universe. The Spitzer survey was designed to study the properties of stars with disks in Taurus, but the discovery of this brown dwarf system demonstrates the value of exploring unexpected regions of parameter space.

Future studies of this system will focus on determining its orbital properties and understanding the processes that have shaped its evolution.

This discovery presents a unique opportunity to study the formation and evolution of brown dwarfs in isolation, providing insights into the processes that shape the properties of these enigmatic objects.

Our observations were conducted using the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) instruments. We employed a combination of photometric and spectroscopic techniques to determine the properties of the brown dwarfs, including their masses, temperatures, and luminosities. The data were reduced and analyzed using standard techniques, including aperture photometry and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting.

The results of our analysis indicate that the brown dwarf system is composed of two objects with effective temperatures of approximately 2500 K and 2800 K, respectively. The cooler object has a mass of about 15 Jupiters, while the hotter object has a mass around 20 Jupiters. The projected separation between the two brown dwarfs is estimated to be around 1000 AU, making this system one of the widest known binary brown dwarf systems.

Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of brown dwarf formation and evolution. The fact that this system was born in isolation suggests that brown dwarfs can form through the fragmentation of molecular clouds, rather than requiring the presence of a protostellar disk. This challenges current theories of brown dwarf formation, which often rely on the presence of a disk to explain the observed properties of these objects.

Furthermore, the properties of this system suggest that brown dwarfs may undergo significant mass loss during their early evolution, potentially leading to the formation of wide binary systems like the one we have discovered. This mass loss could be driven by strong winds or magnetic activity, which are thought to be common among brown dwarfs.

In addition to its implications for brown dwarf science, this discovery also highlights the importance of serendipitous observations in advancing our understanding of the universe. The Spitzer survey was designed to study the properties of stars with disks in Taurus, but the discovery of this brown dwarf system demonstrates the value of exploring unexpected regions of parameter space.

Future studies of this system will focus on determining its orbital properties and understanding the processes that have shaped its evolution. This will involve a combination of follow-up observations using","During a survey for stars with disks in the Taurus star-forming region using the Spitzer (IRAC) and Kepler (K2) space telescopes, a wide binary brown dwarf (WBD) was discovered.

In the present paper I formulate a framework that accommodates many unambiguous discrimination problems. I ","In the present paper I formulate a framework that accommodates many unambiguous discrimination problems. I show that the prior information about any type of constituent (state, channel, or observable) allows us to reformulate the discrimination among finite number of alternatives as the discrimination among finite number of average constituents. Using this framework I solve several unambiguous tasks. I present a solution to optimal unambiguous comparison of two ensembles of unknown quantum states. I consider two cases: 1) The two unknown states are arbitrary pure states of qudits. 2) Alternatively, they are coherent states of single-mode optical fields. For this case I propose simple and optimal experimental setup composed of beam-splitters and a photodetector. As a second tasks I consider an unambiguous identification (UI) of coherent states. In this task identical quantum systems are prepared in coherent states and labeled as unknown and reference states, respectively. The promise is that one reference state is the same as the unknown state and the task is to find out unambiguously which one it is. The particular choice of the reference states is unknown to us, and only the probability distribution describing this choice is known. In a general case when multiple copies of unknown and reference states are available I propose a scheme consisting of beamsplitters and photodetectors that is optimal within linear optics. UI can be considered as a search in a quantum database, whose elements are the reference states and the query is represented by the unknown state. This perspective motivated me to show that reference states can be recovered after the measurement and might be used (with reduced success rate) in subsequent UI.

Moreover, I analyze the influence of noise in preparation of coherent states on the performance of the proposed setup. Another problem I address is the unambiguous comparison of a pair of unknown qudit unitary channels. I characterize all solutions and identify the optimal ones. I prove that in optimal experiments for comparison of unitary channels the entanglement is necessary. The last task I studied is the unambiguous comparison of unknown non-degenerate projective measurements. I distinguish between measurement devices with apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases only the difference of the measurements can be concluded unambiguously. For the labeled case I derive the optimal strategy if each unknown measurement is used only once. However, if the apparatuses are not labeled, then each measurement device must be used (at least) twice. In particular, for qubit measurement apparatuses with unlabeled outcomes I derive the optimal test state in the two-shots scenario.","(468, 24)","The concept of unambiguous measurements in quantum theory has been a subject of intense investigation over the past few decades. The basic idea behind unambiguous measurements is to determine the outcome of a quantum measurement without any ambiguity or error. In other words, it involves distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states with certainty, without destroying these states or introducing any uncertainty in the measurement.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the theory of unambiguous measurements in quantum systems. We begin by introducing the underlying mathematical framework and the associated mathematical notation used in the literature. This includes the notion of projective measurements, POVMs (positive operator valued measures), and the resulting measurement operators that play a crucial role in the theory of unambiguous measurements. We then move on to discuss the main results and findings in the field, highlighting the key theoretical and experimental advances that have been made in recent years.

One central theme that emerges from our review is the importance of understanding the relationship between unambiguous measurements and other concepts of quantum measurement theory. For example, we discuss how unambiguous measurements can be used to obtain more precise information about quantum states, how they relate to other entropic measures such as the von Neumann entropy and the quantum mutual information, and how they can be used to define new measures of non-classicality in quantum systems.

Another important aspect of unambiguous measurements is their relationship to other areas of quantum information science, such as quantum cryptography and quantum communication. We explore some of the key connections between these fields, providing a unified framework for understanding the role of unambiguous measurements in broader quantum information protocols.

Finally, we conclude by discussing some future directions for research in the field of unambiguous measurements. This includes new theoretical developments, such as the study of multi-partite unambiguous measurements and the relationship between unambiguous measurements and quantum error correction. We also highlight some of the key experimental challenges that remain to be addressed in the quest for more precise and accurate quantum measurements.

Overall, our review provides a comprehensive overview of the theory of unambiguous measurements in quantum systems, highlighting the key theoretical and experimental advances that have been made in recent years. We believe that this work will be of interest to physicists and other researchers working in the field of quantum information science, as well as to those interested in the deeper conceptual foundations of quantum theory.","(440, 16)","In the present paper I formulate a framework that accommodates many unambiguous discrimination problems.

Within the GPT framework, I introduce a novel concept called ""unambiguous distinguishability.""

I demonstrate that unambiguous distinguishability can be quantified using a single parameter, which I refer to as the ""unambiguous discriminability.""

Shock modelling predicts an electron density enhancement within the magnetic precursor of C-shocks. Previous observations ","Shock modelling predicts an electron density enhancement within the magnetic precursor of C-shocks. Previous observations of SiO, H13CO+, HN13C and H13CN toward the young L1448-mm outflow showed an over-excitation of the ion fluid that was attributed to an electron density enhancement in the precursor. We re-visit this interpretation and test if it still holds when we consider different source morphologies and kinetic temperatures for the observed molecules, and also give some insight on the spatial extent of the electron density enhancement around L1448-mm.

We estimate the opacities of H13CO+ and HN13C by observing the J=3\to2 lines of rarer isotopologues to confirm that the emission is optically thin. To model the excitation of the molecules, we use the large velocity gradient (LVG) approximation with updated collisional coefficients to i) re- analyse the observations toward the positions where the over-excitation of H13CO+ has previously been observed [i.e. toward L1448- mm at offsets (0,0) and (0,-10)], and ii) to investigate if the electron density enhancement is still required for the cases of extended and compact emission, and for kinetic temperatures of up to 400 K. We also report several lines of SiO, HN13C and H13CO+ toward new positions around this outflow, to investigate the spatial extent of the over-excitation of the ions in L1448-mm. From the isotopologue observations, we find that the emission of H13CO+ and HN13C from the precursor is optically thin if this emission is extended. Using the new collisional coefficients, an electron density enhancement is still needed to explain the excitation of H13CO+ for extended emission and for gas temperatures of\le 400 K toward L1448-mm (0,-10), and possibly also toward L1448-mm (0,0). For compact emission the data cannot be fitted. We do not find any evidence for the over-excitation of the ion fluid toward the newly observed positions around L1448-mm.

The observed line emission of SiO, H13CO+ and HN13C toward L1448-mm (0,0) and (0,-10) is consistent with an electron density enhancement in the precursor component, if this emission is spatially extended. This is also true for the case of high gas temperatures (\le400 K) toward the (0,-10) offset. The electron density enhancement seems to be restricted to the southern, redshifted lobe of the L1448-mm outflow. Interferometric images of the line emission of these molecules are needed to confirm the spatial extent of the over-excitation of the ions and thus, of the electron density enhancement in the magnetic precursor of L1448-mm.","(460, 14)","This study aims to investigate the differences in excitations between ionized and neutral fluids in the magnetic precursor of L1448-mm, a young stellar object. Our observations reveal that the ionized fluid exhibits a high degree of excitation within the magnetic precursor, while the neutral fluid shows lower levels of excitation. This discrepancy suggests that ionized and neutral fluids experience different excitation mechanisms.

We utilized cutting-edge observational techniques, including Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Very Large Array (VLA), to examine the spectral energy distribution of the magnetic precursor. Our measurements provide insight into the molecular composition of the precursor environment, with detailed information about the spectral lines emitted by various molecules.

Our analysis uncovered several significant findings, including the identification of complex organic molecules in the magnetic precursor, such as methanol and formamide. Additionally, we established the presence of magnetic fields in the precursor, which are responsible for producing the observed anisotropic emission. These magnetic fields likely play a critical role in the excitation and ionization of fluids within the precursor.

Our results have several important implications for our understanding of young stellar objects, particularly in relation to the formation and evolution of magnetic fields. The differences in excitation mechanisms between ionized and neutral fluids suggest that magnetic fields may influence the ionization state of fluids within protostellar environments. Further research in this area may shed light on the complex physical processes that govern the evolution of young stellar objects.

A so-called smart material is a material that is the seat of one or more ","A so-called smart material is a material that is the seat of one or more multiphysical coupling. One of the key points in the development of the constitutive laws of these materials, either at the local or at the global scale, is to formulate a free energy density (or enthalpy) from vectors, tensors, at a given order and for a class of given symmetry, depending on the symmetry classes of the crystal constituting the material or the symmetry of the representative volume element. This article takes as a support of study the stress and magnetization couple ($\sigma$, m) involved in the phenomena of magnetoelastic coupling in a cubic symmetry medium. Several studies indeed show a non-monotonic sensitivity of the magnetic susceptibility and magnetostriction of certain soft magnetic materials under stress. Modeling such a phenomenon requires the introduction of a second order stress term in the Gibbs free energy density. A polynomial formulation in the two variables stress and magnetization is preferred over a tensorial formulation. For a given material symmetry class, this allows to express more easily the free energy density at any bi-degree in $\sigma$ and m (i.e. at any constitutive tensors order for the so-called tensorial formulation). A rigorous and systematic method is essential to obtain the high-degree magneto-mechanical coupling terms and to build a free energy density function at any order which is invariant by the action of the cubic (octahedral) group. For that aim, theoretical and computer tools in Invariant Theory, that allow for the mathematical description of cubic nonlinear magneto-elasticity, are introduced. Minimal integrity bases of the invariant algebra for the pair (m, $\sigma$), under the proper (orientation-preserving) and the full cubic groups, are then proposed. The minimal integrity basis for the proper cubic group is constituted of 60 invariants, while the minimal integrity basis for the full cubic group (the one of interest for magneto-elasticity) is made up of 30 invariants. These invariants are formulated in a (coordinate free) intrinsic manner, using a generalized cross product to write some of them. The counting of independent invariants of a given multi-degree in (m, $\sigma$) is performed. It is shown accordingly that it is possible to list without error all the material parameters useful for the description of the coupled magnetoelastic behavior from the integrity basis. The technique is applied to derive general expressions $\Psi$ $\star$ ($\sigma$, m) of the free energy density at the magnetic domains scale exhibiting cubic symmetry. The classic results for an isotropic medium are recovered.","(482, 17)","The study of magnetostriction in materials has been the focus of numerous theoretical and experimental investigations due to its potential applications in sensors, actuators, transducers and other devices. The nonlinearity observed in magnetostriction behavior in some materials has motivated researchers to investigate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon and to explore ways to enhance its performance.

In this work, we investigate cubic nonlinear magnetostriction in materials. To accomplish this, we develop an integrity-based approach that takes into account the role of lattice symmetry, magnetic anisotropy, and electronic band structure on cubic magnetostriction in materials. Our approach is based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, which incorporates both the magnetization dynamics and the lattice deformation dynamics, providing a unified framework for understanding the magnetostrictive behavior of materials. By coupling the LLG equation with the elasticity equation, we are able to study the magnetostriction of materials under different magnetic fields, crystal symmetries, and temperature conditions.

We apply our integrity-based approach to several materials including Fe, Co, and Ni, and show that our results are in good agreement with experimental observations. We also investigate the effect of defects, such as impurities and dislocations, on the magnetostriction behavior of materials. Our simulations reveal that the presence of defects can significantly affect the magnetostriction, leading to a reduction in saturation magnetostriction and a shift in the magnetic field dependence of the magnetostriction.

Our results provide insights into the mechanisms governing cubic nonlinear magnetostriction in materials, and demonstrate the importance of considering the integrity of crystals, as well as magnetic and electronic properties, when designing materials with enhanced magnetostriction. These findings could impact the development of magnetostrictive devices for various technological applications including magnetic sensors, actuators, and transducers. Further investigations should focus on understanding the effects of strain, temperature, and other external factors on magnetostriction in materials, which could lead to the development of even more advanced materials for applications in the future.","(356, 12)","A so-called smart material is a material that is the seat of one or more  properties that can be changed in a controlled manner by an external stimulus such as temperature, light, voltage, or magnetic field.

Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a ubiquitous problem in computational biology. Although it is NP-hard ","Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a ubiquitous problem in computational biology. Although it is NP-hard to find an optimal solution for an arbitrary number of sequences, due to the importance of this problem researchers are trying to push the limits of exact algorithms further. Since MSA can be cast as a classical path finding problem, it is attracting a growing number of AI researchers interested in heuristic search algorithms as a challenge with actual practical relevance. In this paper, we first review two previous, complementary lines of research. Based on Hirschbergs algorithm, Dynamic Programming needs O(kN^(k-1)) space to store both the search frontier and the nodes needed to reconstruct the solution path, for k sequences of length N.

Best first search, on the other hand, has the advantage of bounding the search space that has to be explored using a heuristic. However, it is necessary to maintain all explored nodes up to the final solution in order to prevent the search from re-expanding them at higher cost. Earlier approaches to reduce the Closed list are either incompatible with pruning methods for the Open list, or must retain at least the boundary of the Closed list. In this article, we present an algorithm that attempts at combining the respective advantages; like A* it uses a heuristic for pruning the search space, but reduces both the maximum Open and Closed size to O(kN^(k-1)), as in Dynamic Programming. The underlying idea is to conduct a series of searches with successively increasing upper bounds, but using the DP ordering as the key for the Open priority queue.

With a suitable choice of thresholds, in practice, a running time below four times that of A* can be expected. In our experiments we show that our algorithm outperforms one of the currently most successful algorithms for optimal multiple sequence alignments, Partial Expansion A*, both in time and memory.

Moreover, we apply a refined heuristic based on optimal alignments not only of pairs of sequences, but of larger subsets. This idea is not new; however, to make it practically relevant we show that it is equally important to bound the heuristic computation appropriately, or the overhead can obliterate any possible gain. Furthermore, we discuss a number of improvements in time and space efficiency with regard to practical implementations. Our algorithm, used in conjunction with higher-dimensional heuristics, is able to calculate for the first time the optimal alignment for almost all of the problems in Reference 1 of the benchmark database BAliBASE.","(473, 15)","Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an important task in molecular biology that involves aligning three or more biological sequences. Accurate MSA aids in understanding evolutionary relationships among organisms, predicting protein structure and function, and identifying conserved regions for designing new drugs. However, finding an optimal MSA is a computationally expensive problem. In this paper, we propose an improved search algorithm for optimal multiple-sequence alignment that outperforms the existing state-of-the-art search algorithms in terms of both time and accuracy.

The proposed algorithm builds upon the progressive alignment methods that first construct an initial guide tree using pairwise alignments and then iteratively align sequences according to the guide tree. The main idea of our algorithm is to refine the guide tree by iteratively swapping subtrees and re-aligning sequences according to the updated guide tree. We refer to our algorithm as Tree-swapping Progressive Alignment (TPA). 

In our experiments, we tested TPA on a diverse set of MSA benchmarks and compared it with other state-of-the-art search algorithms. The results showed that TPA consistently outperformed other algorithms in terms of both objective function values and running time. Specifically, TPA achieved a better trade-off between accuracy and time than the widely used SATé algorithm. TPA also outperformed the recent COFFEE algorithm in terms of running time, while achieving similar accuracy.

Our algorithm has two key advantages. First, it produces high-quality MSA solutions with significantly improved running time over the existing methods. Second, TPA is straightforward to implement and can be easily integrated into existing MSA software pipelines. Our algorithm significantly advances the state-of-the-art in MSA search algorithms and has the potential to impact a wide range of applications in molecular biology and bioinformatics.

In conclusion, this paper proposes TPA, a novel search algorithm for optimal multiple-sequence alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that TPA has superior performance in both objective function values and running time compared to the existing state-of-the-art search algorithms. We believe that our algorithm can have a significant impact on many molecular biology and bioinformatics applications which depend on accurate and efficient multiple sequence alignment.","(373, 18)","Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a ubiquitous problem in computational biology.

Our research question is: Can we develop a more efficient and accurate algorithm for MSA that outperforms state-of-the-art methods? To answer this question, we employed a multi-step approach. First, we analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of existing MSA algorithms, including CLUSTALW 2, MUSCLE 3, and MAFFT 4. We identified key factors contributing to their limitations, such as suboptimal scoring functions and inefficient search strategies.

Next, we designed a novel scoring function that incorporates both sequence similarity and structural information. Our scoring function assigns higher weights to residues with similar physicochemical properties and lower weights to those with dissimilar properties. This approach allows our algorithm to better capture the nuances of protein structure and function.

This hybrid approach enables our algorithm to efficiently explore the vast solution space while avoiding local optima.

Collisions of actinide nuclei form, during very short times of few zs ($10^{-21}$ s), the ","Collisions of actinide nuclei form, during very short times of few zs ($10^{-21}$ s), the heaviest ensembles of interacting nucleons available on Earth. Such collisions are used to produce super-strong electric fields by the huge number of interacting protons to test spontaneous positron-electron pair emission (vacuum decay) predicted by the quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory.

Multi-nucleon transfer in actinide collisions could also be used as an alternative way to fusion in order to produce neutron-rich heavy and superheavy elements thanks to inverse quasifission mechanisms. Actinide collisions are studied in a dynamical quantum microscopic approach. The three-dimensional time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) code {\textsc{tdhf3d}} is used with a full Skyrme energy density functional to investigate the time evolution of expectation values of one-body operators, such as fragment position and particle number. This code is also used to compute the dispersion of the particle numbers (e.g., widths of fragment mass and charge distributions) from TDHF transfer probabilities, on the one hand, and using the Balian-Veneroni variational principle, on the other hand. A first application to test QED is discussed. Collision times in $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U are computed to determine the optimum energy for the observation of the vacuum decay. It is shown that the initial orientation strongly affects the collision times and reaction mechanism. The highest collision times predicted by TDHF in this reaction are of the order of $\sim4$ zs at a center of mass energy of 1200 MeV. According to modern calculations based on the Dirac equation, the collision times at $E_{cm}>1$ GeV are sufficient to allow spontaneous electron-positron pair emission from QED vacuum decay, in case of bare uranium ion collision. A second application of actinide collisions to produce neutron-rich transfermiums is discussed. A new inverse quasifission mechanism associated to a specific orientation of the nuclei is proposed to produce transfermium nuclei ($Z>100$) in the collision of prolate deformed actinides such as $^{232}$Th+$^{250}$Cf.

The collision of the tip of one nucleus with the side of the other results in a nucleon flux toward the latter. The probability distributions for transfermium production in such a collision are computed. The produced nuclei are more neutron-rich than those formed in fusion reactions, thus, leading to more stable isotopes closer to the predicted superheavy island of stability. In addition to mass and charge dispersion, the Balian-Veneroni variational principle is used to compute correlations between $Z$ and $N$ distributions, which are zero in standard TDHF calculations.","(492, 17)","This research paper investigates the collisions between actinides for QED and superheavy elements using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory and the Balian-V\'en\'eroni variational principle. The aim of this study is to gain insights into the behavior of these elements under extreme conditions.

The time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory is a widely accepted theoretical framework for studying the dynamics of many-body systems. It is used to calculate the electronic structure of atoms and molecules and provides a quantitative description of the time-evolution of their properties. The Balian-V\'en\'eroni variational principle complements the Hartree-Fock theory by providing a systematic way to calculate the ground-state energy of a many-body system.

Combining these two frameworks, we investigate the collisions between actinides for QED and superheavy elements. The QED (Quantum Electrodynamics) effects play a crucial role in the electronic structure and properties of heavy elements, and understanding them is essential to accurately model the behavior of these elements. Superheavy elements (SHEs) are a class of elements with atomic numbers greater than 104, which have unique properties due to their large size and high atomic mass. They are of particular interest due to their potential applications in nuclear technology and as probes of fundamental physics.

Our results show that the collisions between actinides for QED and SHEs have a profound impact on the electronic structure and properties of these elements. We observe significant changes in the ionization potential, dipole moment, and electronic density distribution due to collision-induced excitation and ionization. Our calculations provide insights into the fundamental processes that govern the behavior of these elements, which is essential for developing accurate models for predicting their behavior under extreme conditions.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates the importance of understanding the collisions between actinides for QED and superheavy elements.

The TDHF theory is based on the mean-field approximation, where the many-body wave function is approximated by a single Slater determinant. This approach allows us to describe the evolution of the system in real time, taking into account the correlations between the nucleons.

To further improve the accuracy of our calculations, we apply the Balian-Vénéroni (BV) variational principle, which is a powerful tool for optimizing the wave function and minimizing the energy of the system. The BV principle is based on the idea of maximizing the overlap between the exact and approximate wave functions, which leads to a more accurate description of the system. By combining the TDHF theory with the BV principle, we can obtain a more reliable and accurate description of the collisions and the resulting SHEs.

Our calculations focus on the collision of two actinide ions, $^{238}$U and $^{248}$Cm, which are two of the heaviest elements in the actinide series. We investigate the dependence of the collision outcome on the impact parameter, which is a measure of the distance between the centers of the two ions at the moment of collision. By varying the impact parameter, we can explore the different possible outcomes of the collision, ranging from complete fusion to deep inelastic scattering.

Our results show that the TDHF-BV approach provides a good description of the collision dynamics, reproducing the main features of the experimental data. We find that the collision outcome is sensitive to the impact parameter, with smaller impact parameters leading to more complete fusion and larger impact parameters resulting in deeper inelastic scattering.

We have analyzed nearly all images of the Taurus star-forming region at 3.6-24um that were ","We have analyzed nearly all images of the Taurus star-forming region at 3.6-24um that were obtained during the cryogenic mission of the Spitzer Space Telescope (46 deg^2) and have measured photometry for all known members of the region that are within these data, corresponding to 348 sources. We have classified the members of Taurus according to whether they show evidence of disks and envelopes (classes I, II, and III). The disk fraction in Taurus is 75% for solar-mass stars and declines to 45% for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (0.01-0.3 M_sun). This dependence on stellar mass is similar to that measured for Cha I, although the disk fraction in Taurus is slightly higher overall, probably because of its younger age (1 vs. 2-3 Myr). In comparison, the disk fraction for solar-mass stars is much lower (20%) in IC 348 and Sigma Ori, which are denser than Taurus and Cha I and are roughly coeval with the latter. These data indicate that disk lifetimes for solar-mass stars are longer in regions that have lower stellar densities. Through an analysis of multiple epochs of photometry that are available for ~200 Taurus members, we find that stars with disks exhibit significantly greater mid-IR variability than diskless stars. Finally, we have used our data in Taurus to refine the criteria for primordial, evolved, and transitional disks. The number ratio of evolved and transitional disks to primordial disks in Taurus is 15/98 for K5-M5, indicating a timescale of 0.15 x tau(primordial)=0.45 Myr for the clearing of the inner regions of optically thick disks. After applying the same criteria to older clusters (2-10 Myr), we find that the proportions of evolved and transitional disks in those populations are consistent with the measurements in Taurus when their star formation histories are properly taken into account. ERRATUM: In Table 7, we inadvertently omitted the spectral type bins in which class II sources were placed in Table 8 based on their bolometric luminosities (applies only to stars that lack spectroscopic classifications). The bins were K6-M3.5 for FT Tau, DK Tau B, and IRAS 04370+2559, M3.5-M6 for IRAS 04200+2759, IT Tau B, and ITG 1, and M6-M8 for IRAS 04325+2402 C. In addition, the values of K_s-[3.6] in Table 13 and Figure 26 for spectral types of M4-M9 are incorrect.

We present corrected versions of Table 13 and Figure 26.","(449, 13)","The Taurus star-forming region is known for its rich disk population, making it an ideal target for studying protoplanetary disks and their evolution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the disk population in Taurus using ALMA observations at 1.3 mm. We identify 141 disks around 107 young stellar objects with a detection rate of 65%. We find that disk mass and radius follow log-normal distributions with medians of 0.014 Msun and 80 au, respectively. We also find that the disk population in Taurus can be divided into two groups based on their mass. The high-mass group has a median mass of 0.038 Msun and includes 23 disks, while the low-mass group has a median mass of 0.008 Msun and includes 118 disks. We investigate the relationship between disk and stellar properties and find that disk mass scales with stellar mass as M_disk∝M_star^1.4. We also find evidence for a correlation between disk mass and accretion rate. We discuss the implications of our results for disk evolution and planet formation.

In addition to the statistical analysis of the disk population in Taurus, we present detailed studies of individual disks. We analyze the continuum emission and identify millimeter-bright zones, which we attribute to dust trapping and concentration. We also detect molecular lines from CO and isotopologues and measure gas masses in a subset of disks. We find that the gas-to-dust ratio in these disks is similar to that in the interstellar medium, except for a few disks with significantly lower ratios. We discuss the implications of these measurements for the gas content and chemistry of protoplanetary disks.

Finally, we compare the disk population in Taurus with those in other star-forming regions. We find that the disk mass distribution in Taurus is similar to that in other regions, but the fraction of Class II objects with disks is higher. This suggests that Taurus is a favorable environment for planet formation. We also find that the correlation between disk mass and stellar mass is steeper in Taurus than in other regions, which may reflect differences in the initial conditions or the star formation process.

Our study provides a comprehensive description of the disk population in Taurus and sheds light on the physical processes that govern disk evolution and planet formation. The results can be used as a benchmark for theoretical models of disk evolution and as a reference for future observations with ALMA and other telescopes.","(435, 20)","We have analyzed nearly all images of the Taurus star-forming region at 3.6-24um that were  taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope's Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) and the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) between 2003 and 2008.

We aimed to investigate the properties of circumstellar disks around young stellar objects (YSOs) in Taurus, including their sizes, masses, and dust temperatures, as well as the prevalence of disk accretion and outflow activity.

Our sample consists of over 1,000 YSOs in Taurus, which we identified using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic criteria.

Our results show that the disk population of Taurus is characterized by a wide range of sizes and masses, from small, optically thick disks to large, optically thin disks.

Aims. The HIFI instrument onboard Herschel has allowed high spectral resolution and sensitive observations of ","Aims. The HIFI instrument onboard Herschel has allowed high spectral resolution and sensitive observations of ground-state transi- tions of three molecular ions: the methylidyne cation CH+, its isotopologue 13CH+, and sulfanylium SH+. Because of their unique chemical properties, a comparative analysis of these cations provides essential clues to the link between the chemistry and dynamics of the diffuse interstellar medium. Methods. The CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ lines are observed in absorption towards the distant high-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) DR21(OH), G34.3+0.1, W31C, W33A, W49N, and W51, and towards two sources close to the Galactic centre, SgrB2(N) and SgrA*+50. All sight lines sample the diffuse interstellar matter along pathlengths of several kiloparsecs across the Galactic Plane. In order to compare the velocity structure of each species, the observed line profiles were deconvolved from the hyperfine structure of the SH+ transition and the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ spectra were independently decomposed into Gaussian velocity components. To analyse the chemical composition of the foreground gas, all spectra were divided, in a second step, into velocity intervals over which the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ column densities and abundances were derived. Results. SH+ is detected along all observed lines of sight, with a velocity structure close to that of CH+ and 13CH+. The linewidth distributions of the CH+, SH+, and 13CH+ Gaussian components are found to be similar. These distributions have the same mean (<\delta\u{psion}> ~ 4.2 km s-1) and standard deviation (\sigma(\delta\u{psion}) ~ 1.5 km s-1). This mean value is also close to that of the linewidth distribution of the CH+ visible transitions detected in the solar neighbourhood. We show that the lack of absorption components narrower than 2 km s-1 is not an artefact caused by noise: the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ line profiles are therefore statistically broader than those of most species detected in absorption in diffuse interstellar gas (e. g. HCO+, CH, or CN). The SH+/CH+ column density ratio observed in the components located away from the Galactic centre spans two orders of magnitude and correlates with the CH+ abundance. Conversely, the ratio observed in the components close to the Galactic centre varies over less than one order of magnitude with no apparent correlation with the CH+ abundance. The observed dynamical and chemical properties of SH+ and CH+ are proposed to trace the ubiquitous process of turbulent dissipation, in shocks or shears, in the diffuse ISM and the specific environment of the Galactic centre regions.","(479, 17)","The study of interstellar molecules provides a unique opportunity to understand the chemical and physical processes that take place in star-forming regions. In this research paper, we present the results of a comparative study of CH+ and SH+ absorption lines observed towards distant star-forming regions. Our analysis is based on a sample of 20 sources located in the Galactic disk and covering a range of physical conditions.

We used data obtained with the VLT-UVES spectrograph, which provides high-resolution spectra in the UV and visible bands. Our analysis was focused on the detection and measurement of absorption lines originating from CH+ and SH+, two reactive molecular species that are believed to play an important role in the gas-phase chemistry of the interstellar medium.

Our results show that CH+ and SH+ are present in the studied sources with a wide range of column densities and velocity dispersions. Interestingly, we found that the ratio between the column densities of CH+ and SH+ varies across the sample, with values ranging from 0.01 to 10. This indicates that the relative abundances of these two species can change significantly depending on the local physical conditions.

To further investigate the origin of the observed variations, we performed a detailed analysis of the chemical and physical properties of the studied sources. Our results suggest that the observed trends can be explained by a combination of factors, including the level of ionization, the gas temperature, and the local radiation field.

Overall, our study provides new insights into the chemistry and physics of star-forming regions and highlights the importance of reactive molecular species such as CH+ and SH+.

The HIFI instrument onboard Herschel has allowed high spectral resolution and sensitive observations of ionic absorption lines in the interstellar medium (ISM).

Our goal is to investigate the formation and destruction mechanisms of these ions in the ISM, as well as their potential as tracers of physical and chemical conditions in SFRs.

Methodology. We analyzed archival Herschel/HIFI spectra of CH+ J=1-0 and SH+ J=1/2-1/2 lines towards a sample of 15 SFRs, including giant molecular clouds (GMCs), H II regions, and ultracompact H II regions (UCHIIs). We used a combination of radiative transfer models and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) calculations to derive column densities and excitation temperatures of the ions. We also compared our results with predictions from state-of-the-art chemical models of the ISM.

Findings. We detected CH+ absorption lines towards 12 out of 15 targets, with column densities ranging from 10^11 to 10^14 cm^-2. In contrast, SH+ absorption lines were detected towards only 5 targets, with much lower column densities (10^9-10^12 cm^-2).

A theory of Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances for stochastic differential systems is presented. These resonances are ","A theory of Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances for stochastic differential systems is presented. These resonances are defined as the eigenvalues of the generator (Kolmogorov operator) of a given stochastic system. By relying on the theory of Markov semigroups, decomposition formulas of correlation functions and power spectral densities (PSDs) in terms of RP resonances are then derived.

These formulas describe, for a broad class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), how the RP resonances characterize the decay of correlations as well as the signal's oscillatory components manifested by peaks in the PSD.It is then shown that a notion reduced RP resonances can be rigorously defined, as soon as the dynamics is partially observed within a reduced state space V . These reduced resonances are obtained from the spectral elements of reduced Markov operators acting on functions of the state space V , and can be estimated from series. They inform us about the spectral elements of some coarse-grained version of the SDE generator. When the time-lag at which the transitions are collected from partial observations in V , is either sufficiently small or large, it is shown that the reduced RP resonances approximate the (weak) RP resonances of the generator of the conditional expectation in V , i.e. the optimal reduced system in V obtained by averaging out the contribution of the unobserved variables. The approach is illustrated on a stochastic slow-fast system for which it is shown that the reduced RP resonances allow for a good reconstruction of the correlation functions and PSDs, even when the time-scale separation is weak.The companions articles, Part II and Part III, deal with further practical aspects of the theory presented in this contribution. One important byproduct consists of the diagnosis usefulness of stochastic dynamics that RP resonances provide. This is illustrated in the case of a stochastic Hopf bifurcation in Part II. There, it is shown that such a bifurcation has a clear manifestation in terms of a geometric organization of the RP resonances along discrete parabolas in the left half plane.

These systems are characterized by randomness, which is modeled by mathematical expressions known as stochastic differential equations. Even though stochastic systems have been extensively studied over the years, their reduction to a simpler state space remains a challenging task, and one that is essential for making these systems computationally tractable.

In this paper, we explore the theory behind the Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances of stochastic systems in reduced state space. We introduce the concept of RP resonances and demonstrate that they play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of these systems. Specifically, we show how RP resonances can be used to approximate the time evolution of a system, and how they can provide valuable information about the underlying physical processes.

Our analysis builds on recent advances in the field of dynamical systems and spectral theory, and we present a rigorous mathematical framework for studying RP resonances of stochastic systems. We use this framework to derive explicit formulas for the RP resonances of several important classes of stochastic systems, including Langevin systems and stochastic partial differential equations.

Our results demonstrate that RP resonances provide a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of stochastic systems in reduced state space. They enable us to predict the long-term behavior of a system and to identify the key features that drive its dynamics. Moreover, our analysis shows that RP resonances are intimately related to certain geometric properties of the state space, which opens up new avenues for studying the behavior of stochastic systems in complex geometries.

In this paper, we focus on the classification of complex networks based on topological properties. Topology refers to the study of the properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations. Topological properties of complex networks include measures such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and the presence of hubs.

Our research aims to provide an overview of the current state of the field, to identify the most significant topological properties that can be used for classification, and to investigate how these properties are related to the structure and function of complex networks. We begin by defining the term ""complex network"" and presenting a brief history of its development. We then discuss the main types of complex networks that have been studied, such as social networks, biological networks, and technological networks, and provide examples of each.

We proceed by presenting the most common topological properties that have been used for classification, and explain their significance. Degree distribution refers to the distribution of the number of links per node in a network and has been found to be a key feature in several classification studies. The clustering coefficient measures the density of connections among a node's neighbors and is important in determining the resilience of a network to random failures. Hubs are nodes with the highest degree of connectivity and play a crucial role in determining the flow of information in a network.

We then discuss various classification methods that have been proposed, such as hierarchical clustering, community detection, and machine learning algorithms. We compare the effectiveness of different methods in classifying complex networks based on topological properties and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.

Our final contribution is to investigate the relationship between the topological properties of complex networks and their functional characteristics, such as their ability to perform tasks such as information diffusion or transportation. We provide examples of how topological properties can be linked to functional properties in specific complex network types.

This paper deals with an inverse problem applied to the field of building physics to ","This paper deals with an inverse problem applied to the field of building physics to experimentally estimate three sorption isotherm coefficients of a wood fiber material. First, the mathematical model, based on convective transport of moisture, the Optimal Experiment Design (OED) and the experimental set-up are presented. Then measurements of relative humidity within the material are carried out, after searching the OED, which is based on the computation of the sensitivity functions and a priori values of the unknown parameters employed in the mathematical model. The OED enables to plan the experimental conditions in terms of sensor positioning and boundary conditions out of 20 possible designs, ensuring the best accuracy for the identification method and, thus, for the estimated parameter. Two experimental procedures were identified: i) single step of relative humidity from 10% to 75% and ii) multiple steps of relative humidity 10-75-33-75% with an 8-day duration period for each step. For both experiment designs, it has been shown that the sensor has to be placed near the impermeable boundary. After the measurements, the parameter estimation problem is solved using an interior point algorithm to minimize the cost function. Several tests are performed for the definition of the cost function, by using the L^2 or L^\infty norm and considering the experiments separately or at the same time. It has been found out that the residual between the experimental data and the numerical model is minimized when considering the discrete Euclidean norm and both experiments separately.

It means that two parameters are estimated using one experiment while the third parameter is determined with the other experiment. Two cost functions are defined and minimized for this approach. Moreover, the algorithm requires less than 100 computations of the direct model to obtain the solution. In addition, the OED sensitivity functions enable to capture an approximation of the probability distribution function of the estimated parameters. The determined sorption isotherm coefficients calibrate the numerical model to fit better the experimental data. However, some discrepancies still appear since the model does not take into account the hysteresis effects on the sorption capacity.

Therefore, the model is improved proposing a second differential equation for the sorption capacity to take into account the hysteresis between the main adsorption and desorption curves. The OED approach is also illustrated for the estimation of five of the coefficients involved in the hysteresis model. To conclude, the prediction of the model with hysteresis are compared with the experimental observations to illustrate the improvement of the prediction.","(456, 18)","Sorption isotherm curves characterize the relationship between the amount of solute adsorbed onto solid surfaces and the concentration of that solute in the fluid phase.

Our method employs a nonlinear regression technique to estimate the parameters used in the Langmuir model equation. Furthermore, we perform a statistical analysis to estimate the uncertainty of the estimated parameters and to calculate the goodness of fit of the Langmuir model equation.

In this paper we propagate a large deviations approach for proving limit theory for (generally) ","In this paper we propagate a large deviations approach for proving limit theory for (generally) multivariate time series with heavy tails. We make this notion precise by introducing regularly varying time series. We provide general large deviation results for functionals acting on a sample path and vanishing in some neighborhood of the origin. We study a variety of such functionals, including large deviations of random walks, their suprema, the ruin functional, and further derive weak limit theory for maxima, point processes, cluster functionals and the tail empirical process. One of the main results of this paper concerns bounds for the ruin probability in various heavy-tailed models including GARCH, stochastic volatility models and solutions to stochastic recurrence equations. 1. Preliminaries and basic motivation In the last decades, a lot of efforts has been put into the understanding of limit theory for dependent sequences, including Markov chains (Meyn and Tweedie [42]), weakly dependent sequences (Dedecker et al. [21]), long-range dependent sequences (Doukhan et al. [23], Samorodnitsky [54]), empirical processes (Dehling et al. [22]) and more general structures (Eberlein and Taqqu [25]), to name a few references. A smaller part of the theory was devoted to limit theory under extremal dependence for point processes, maxima, partial sums, tail empirical processes. Resnick [49, 50] started a systematic study of the relations between the convergence of point processes, sums and maxima, see also Resnick [51] for a recent account. He advocated the use of multivariate regular variation as a flexible tool to describe heavy-tail phenomena combined with advanced continuous mapping techniques. For example, maxima and sums are understood as functionals acting on an underlying point process, if the point process converges these functionals converge as well and their limits are described in terms of the points of the limiting point process. Davis and Hsing [13] recognized the power of this approach for limit theory of point processes, maxima, sums, and large deviations for dependent regularly varying processes, i.e., stationary sequences whose finite-dimensional distributions are regularly varying with the same index. Before [13], limit theory for particular regularly varying stationary sequences was studied for the sample mean, maxima, sample autocovariance and autocorrelation functions of linear and bilinear processes with iid regularly varying noise and extreme value theory was considered for regularly varying ARCH processes and solutions to stochastic recurrence equation, see Rootz\'en [53], Davis and 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Large deviation principle, regularly varying processes, central limit theorem, ruin probabilities, GARCH.","(505, 19)","In this paper, we develop a limit theory for heavy-tailed time series using a large deviations approach. Heavy-tailed time series are often encountered in real-world applications, such as finance, telecommunications, and climate science, making it crucial to have a robust and reliable limit theory for their analysis. Our approach is based on the observation that the tails of such series decay slowly, rendering classical limit theory inadequate in modeling their behavior.

To address this problem, we first establish the asymptotic properties of a general class of heavy-tailed time series that includes, but is not limited to, Pareto-type distributions. We show that our large deviations approach yields a tight and consistent bound on the tails of these distributions and, as a result, provides an accurate description of their tail behavior. Specifically, we demonstrate that our limit theory is able to capture the key features of heavy-tailed time series, such as their high volatility, slow decay rates, and non-Gaussianity, which are often overlooked by standard limit theory.

One of the key benefits of our approach is that it enables us to derive a closed-form expression for the large deviations rate function of a general heavy-tailed time series, which is essential for estimating their rare-event probabilities and tail risks. We use this rate function to derive the important sub-class of regularly varying time series, whose tail behavior is characterized by a power law. Our results show that regularly varying time series exhibit a rich variety of limit behavior, including non-stationary, long-range dependence, and multifractality, providing a valuable insight into their underlying dynamics.

Our analysis is based on a rigorous mathematical framework and is supported by numerical simulations. We apply our theory to several examples of heavy-tailed time series, including stock price returns, exchange rate fluctuations, temperature anomalies, and earthquake magnitudes. Our results demonstrate that the large deviations approach provides a powerful tool for analyzing these complex and highly correlated time series, and has important implications for interdisciplinary research in physics, mathematics, engineering, and economics.

In conclusion, this paper presents a novel and rigorous approach to limit theory for heavy-tailed time series based on the large deviations principle. Our approach provides an accurate and comprehensive picture of their tail behavior and enables us to derive closed-form expressions for their rare-event probabilities and tail risks. We believe that this work will have significant impact on the theoretical and practical understanding of heavy-tailed time series and their applications in various fields.","(451, 15)","In this paper we propagate a large deviations approach for proving limit theory for (generally)  non-identically distributed heavy-tailed time-series. Heavy-tailed time series are ubiquitous in finance, climate science, and other fields where extreme events are of particular interest. However, they pose significant challenges for statistical inference due to their non-regular behavior under standard limit theorems such as the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and the Law of the Iterated Logarithm (LIL). Our goal is to develop a theoretical framework that can accurately capture the asymptotic behavior of these time series.

To address this challenge, we employ the theory of large deviations, which provides a powerful tool for analyzing rare events in complex systems. Specifically, we utilize the Gärtner-Ellis theorem, a fundamental result in large deviations theory that allows us to derive exponential bounds on the probability of rare events. We apply this theorem to a class of heavy-tailed distributions, including the Student's t-distribution, the Cauchy distribution, and the Fréchet distribution, which are commonly encountered in time series analysis.

Our methodology involves two main steps. First, we establish a large deviations principle (LDP) for the partial sums of the time series, which provides an upper bound on the probability of large deviations from the mean. This is achieved by showing that the rate function associated with the LDP converges to a non-trivial limit as the sample size increases. Second, we use the LDP to derive limit theorems for the time series, including a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) and a law of the iterated logarithm (LIL).

Our main findings can be summarized as follows. We show that the LDP for the partial sums holds with a non-trivial rate function, which captures the heavy-tailed behavior of the time series. We then use this LDP to derive a FCLT, which states that the normalized partial sums converge to a Brownian motion in the Skorokhod space. This result has important implications for statistical inference, as it allows us to construct confidence intervals and test hypotheses for the time series. Furthermore, we derive a LIL, which provides a precise bound on the growth rate of the partial sums.

The implications of our results are far-reaching and have significant impact on various fields. In finance, our results can be used to develop more accurate models for risk management and portfolio optimization. In climate science, our results can help to better understand and predict extreme weather events.

If $V$ is a vector space over a field $F$, then we consider the projection ","If $V$ is a vector space over a field $F$, then we consider the projection from the tensor algebra to the symmetric algebra, $\rho_{T,S}:T(V)\to S(V)$.

Our main result, in $\S$1, gives a description of $\ker\rho_{T,S}$. Explicitly, we consider the ${\mathbb Z}_{\geq 2}$-graded $T(V)$-bimodule $T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V)$ and we define $M(V)=(T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V))/W_M(V)$, where $W_M(V)$ is the subbimodule of $T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V)$ generated by $[x,y]\otimes\xi\otimes z\wedge t-x\wedge y\otimes\xi\otimes [z,t]$, with $x,y,z,t\in V$ and $\xi\in T(V)$. $[x,y\wedge z]+[y,z\wedge x]+[z,x\wedge y]$, with $x,y,z\in V$. (If $\eta\in T(V)$ and $\xi\in T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V)$ (or vice-versa) then $[\eta,\xi ]:=\eta\otimes\xi -\xi\otimes\eta\in T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V)$.) Then $M(V)$ is a ${\mathbb Z}_{\geq 2}$-graded $T(V)$-bimodule. If $\eta\in T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V)$ the we denote by $[\eta ]$ its class in $M(V)$. ${\bf Theorem}$ We have an exact sequence $$0\to M(V)\xrightarrow{\rho_{M,T}}T(V)\xrightarrow{\rho_{T,S}}S(V)\to 0,$$ where $\rho_{M,T}$ is given by $[\eta\otimes x\wedge y\otimes \xi ]\mapsto\eta\otimes [x,y]\otimes\xi$ $\forall x,y\in V$, $\eta,\xi\in T(V)$. In $\S$2 we define the graded algebra $S'(V)=T(V)/W_{S'}(V)$, where $S'(V)\subseteq T(V)$ is the ideal generated by $x\otimes y\otimes z- y\otimes z\otimes x$, $x,y,z\in V$, and we prove that there is a n exact sequence $$0\to\Lambda^{\geq 2}(V)\xrightarrow{\rho_{\Lambda^{\geq 2},S'}}S'(V)\xrightarrow{\rho_{S',S}}S(V)\to 0.$$ When we consider the homogeneous parts of degree $2$ we have $M^2(V)=\Lambda^2(V)$ and $S'^2(V)=T^2(V)$. Then both short exact sequences above become $0\to\Lambda^2(V)\to T^2(V)\to S^2(V)\to 0$ where the first morphism is given by $x\wedge y\mapsto [x,y]=x\otimes y-y\otimes x$, a well known result.","(661, 10)","In this paper, we investigate the kernel of the projection map $T(V)\to S(V)$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic not equal to 2. We show that the kernel is precisely the subspace of $T(V)$ consisting of those tensors which are symmetric in each pair of indices. Moreover, we interpret this result in terms of the geometry of the Grassmannian of $r$-planes in $V$, where $r$ is the rank of the symmetric bilinear form associated to $V$.

Our approach relies on a careful analysis of the eigenvalues of an operator $L: T(V)\to T(V)$ defined by $L(T)=\operatorname{Sym}(T)-\operatorname{Alt}(T)$, where $\operatorname{Sym}$ and $\operatorname{Alt}$ denote the symmetrization and alternation operations, respectively. We use the theory of exterior algebra and linear algebra to show that $L$ is a diagonalizable operator, with eigenvalues $1$ and $-1$ occurring with multiplicity equal to the dimension of the spaces of symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors, respectively. This allows us to derive a decomposition of $T(V)$ into eigenspaces of $L$, which leads to our characterization of the kernel of the projection map.

We then turn to the Grassmannian, which is a geometric object that parametrizes $r$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. We introduce a natural symmetric bilinear form on each tangent space of the Grassmannian, which is induced by the restriction of the bilinear form associated to $V$. It turns out that the rank of this bilinear form is precisely $r$. We show that the kernel of the projection map corresponds to the set of tangent spaces at points in the Grassmannian that correspond to isotropic $r$-planes, that is, planes on which the bilinear form vanishes.

We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the study of symmetric tensors and their applications in physics and engineering. We also outline some open questions and directions for future research, which include the study of the kernel of other projection maps in tensor algebra, and the investigation of the geometry of the Grassmannian in the presence of more general bilinear forms.","(448, 12)","If $V$ is a vector space over a field $F$, then we consider the projection  map $T(V) \to S(V)$, where $T(V)$ is the tensor product of $V$ with itself, and $S(V)$ is the symmetric algebra of $V$. The goal of this paper is to investigate the kernel of this projection map, which we denote by $\ker \pi$. Understanding the structure of $\ker \pi$ is crucial in various areas of mathematics and physics, such as representation theory, algebraic geometry, and quantum mechanics.

To tackle this problem, we employ a combination of algebraic and geometric techniques. First, we recall that the tensor product $T(V)$ can be viewed as the space of all multilinear maps from $V^{\times n}$ to $F$, where $n$ ranges over all positive integers. The symmetric algebra $S(V)$, on the other hand, is the quotient of the tensor algebra $T(V)$ by the two-sided ideal generated by all elements of the form $v \otimes w - w \otimes v$, where $v, w \in V$. The projection map $\pi$ is then defined as the natural quotient map from $T(V)$ to $S(V)$.

Using the universal property of the tensor product, we establish an isomorphism between the kernel of $\pi$ and the space of all skew-symmetric multilinear forms on $V$. Specifically, we show that $\ker \pi \cong \bigoplus_{n \geq 1} \wedge^n V$, where $\wedge^n V$ denotes the $n$-th exterior power of $V$. This result has significant implications for the study of representations of Lie algebras and algebraic groups, as it provides a concrete description of the kernel of the canonical projection from the tensor algebra to the symmetric algebra.

Next, we turn our attention to the geometric aspects of the problem. We consider the case where $V$ is equipped with a non-degenerate bilinear form, such as an inner product or a symplectic form. In this setting, we use the theory of Clifford algebras and spinor representations to describe the structure of the kernel. We show that the kernel is isomorphic to the space of all spinors associated with the given bilinear form.

This tutorial presents topological methods for the analysis and visualization of scientific data from a ","This tutorial presents topological methods for the analysis and visualization of scientific data from a user's perspective, with the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a recently released open-source library for topological data analysis.

Topological methods have gained considerably in popularity and maturity over the last twenty years and success stories of established methods have been documented in a wide range of applications (combustion, chemistry, astrophysics, material sciences, etc.) with both acquired and simulated data, in both post-hoc and in-situ contexts. While reference textbooks have been published on the topic, no tutorial at IEEE VIS has covered this area in recent years, and never at a software level and from a user's point-of-view. This tutorial fills this gap by providing a beginner's introduction to topological methods for practitioners, researchers, students, and lecturers. In particular, instead of focusing on theoretical aspects and algorithmic details, this tutorial focuses on how topological methods can be useful in practice for concrete data analysis tasks such as segmentation, feature extraction or tracking. The tutorial describes in detail how to achieve these tasks with TTK.

First, after an introduction to topological methods and their application in data analysis, a brief overview of TTK's main entry point for end users, namely ParaView, will be presented. Second, an overview of TTK's main features will be given. A running example will be described in detail, showcasing how to access TTK's features via ParaView, Python, VTK/C++, and C++. Third, hands-on sessions will concretely show how to use TTK in ParaView for multiple, representative data analysis tasks. Fourth, the usage of TTK will be presented for developers, in particular by describing several examples of visualization and data analysis projects that were built on top of TTK. Finally, some feedback regarding the usage of TTK as a teaching platform for topological analysis will be given.

Presenters of this tutorial include experts in topological methods, core authors of TTK as well as active users, coming from academia, labs, or industry. A large part of the tutorial will be dedicated to hands-on exercises and a rich material package (including TTK pre-installs in virtual machines, code, data, demos, video tutorials, etc.) will be provided to the participants.

This tutorial mostly targets students, practitioners and researchers who are not experts in topological methods but who are interested in using them in their daily tasks. We also target researchers already familiar to topological methods and who are interested in using or contributing to TTK.","(473, 18)","Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has become an indispensable tool for mining insights from complex, high-dimensional data that are increasingly ubiquitous across science and industry. However, despite its power and versatility, TDA can present significant challenges for researchers, practitioners, and data scientists who may not have a sophisticated mathematical background or are not accustomed to working with topology. Here we introduce the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a software library designed to simplify the use of TDA in practice and open new opportunities for research across disciplines.

TTK is an open-source, generic C++ library that provides a comprehensive set of TDA algorithms and data structures that can be seamlessly integrated with existing software applications. TTK offers a modular architecture that enables users to combine different TDA techniques and customize them to their particular needs. TTK takes advantage of parallel computing to accelerate the processing of large datasets, and it can be run on heterogeneous architectures, including multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and clusters. 

A key advantage of TTK is its user-friendly interface, which abstracts away much of the mathematical complexity behind TDA and makes it accessible to a broader audience. TTK provides a range of interactive data visualization tools that enable researchers to explore the topological structure of their data and gain insights into its underlying patterns and anomalies. Additionally, TTK includes a growing number of machine learning algorithms that leverage the topological features of data to improve prediction and classification accuracy.

We showcase the functionality and usability of TTK on several real-world datasets from different domains, including neuroscience, climate science, and computer vision. We demonstrate how TTK can be used to detect topological structures in fMRI images, classify climate patterns, and analyze the segmentation of natural images. We also provide an extensive evaluation of the performance of TTK on large-scale datasets and a comparison with other TDA software libraries, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

In conclusion, TTK provides a powerful and easy-to-use toolbox for TDA that will enable a wide range of researchers and practitioners to unlock the potential of their data and accelerate scientific discovery across applications. As we continue to develop TTK and add new features and algorithms, we are committed to maintaining its focus on usability, performance, and openness, and we welcome contributions and feedback from the TDA community.","(422, 14)","This tutorial presents topological methods for the analysis and visualization of scientific data from a  user-friendly perspective.

TDA is a branch of mathematics that studies the topological properties of data, providing insights into the underlying structure and organization of complex systems.

The research question addressed in this paper is how to make TDA accessible to a broader audience, particularly those without a strong background in mathematics or computer science. To achieve this goal, we developed a user-friendly interface for the TTK, allowing users to easily apply TDA techniques to their data without requiring extensive programming knowledge. The TTK provides a comprehensive set of tools for data processing, feature extraction, and visualization, making it an ideal platform for researchers and practitioners who want to explore the topological aspects of their data.

The methodology employed in this study involves a combination of theoretical and practical approaches. We first reviewed the existing literature on TDA and its applications in various fields, identifying the key challenges and limitations of current methods. We then developed a series of tutorials and examples to demonstrate the usage of the TTK, covering topics such as data loading, filtering, and feature extraction. These tutorials were designed to be self-contained and easy to follow, allowing users to learn the basics of TDA and the TTK through hands-on experience.

The findings of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the TTK in facilitating the application of TDA techniques. Our results show that the TTK can be used to extract meaningful topological features from a wide range of data types, including images, networks, and time-series data. We also found that the TTK provides a flexible and customizable platform for data analysis, allowing users to tailor their workflow to their specific needs and requirements.

The implications of this study are significant, as they highlight the potential of TDA to revolutionize the way we analyze and understand complex systems. By making TDA more accessible and user-friendly, we hope to encourage a wider adoption of these techniques across various fields, leading to new insights and discoveries. Our results also demonstrate the importance of developing user-friendly interfaces for complex software packages, as this can significantly enhance their usability and impact.

Context. Serendipitous X-ray surveys have proven to be an efficient way to find rare objects, ","Context. Serendipitous X-ray surveys have proven to be an efficient way to find rare objects, for example tidal disruption events, changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGN), binary quasars, ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), and intermediate mass black holes. With the advent of very large X-ray surveys, an automated classification of X-ray sources becomes increasingly valuable.Aims.

This work proposes a revisited naive Bayes classification of the X-ray sources in the Swift-XRT and XMM-Newton catalogs into four classes -- AGN, stars, X-ray binaries (XRBs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs) -- based on their spatial, spectral and timing properties and their multiwavelength counterparts. An outlier measure is used to identify objects of other natures. The classifier is optimized to maximize the classification performance of a chosen class (here XRBs) and it is adapted to data mining purposes.Methods. We augmented the X-ray catalogs with multiwavelength data, source class, and variability properties.

We then built a reference sample of about 25000 X-ray sources of known nature.

From this sample the distribution of each property was carefully estimated and taken as reference to assign probabilities of belonging to each class. The classification was then performed on the whole catalog, combining the information from each property.Results. Using the algorithm on the Swift reference sample we retrieved 99%, 98%, 92% and 34% of AGN, stars, XRBs, and CVs, respectively, and the false positive rates are 3%, 1%, 9% and 15%. Similar results are obtained on XMM sources. When applied to a carefully selected test sample, representing 55% of the X-ray catalog, the classification gives consistent results in terms of distributions of source properties. A substantial fraction of sources not belonging to any class is efficiently retrieved using the outlier measure, as well as AGN and stars with properties deviating from the bulk of their class. Our algorithm is then compared to a random forest method; the two showed similar performances but the algorithm presented in this paper improved insight into the grounds of each classification.Conclusions. This robust classification method can be tailored to include additional or different source classes and can be applied to other X-ray catalogs. The transparency of the classification compared to other methods makes it a useful tool in the search for homogeneous populations or rare source types, including multi-messenger events. Such a tool will be increasingly valuable with the development of surveys of unprecedented size, such as LSST, SKA and Athena, and the search for counterparts of multi-messenger events.","(468, 18)","This research paper presents a probabilistic classification method for the identification of X-ray sources, applied to both the Swift-XRT and XMM-Newton catalogs. The classification model is based on a Bayesian framework, which allows us to evaluate the uncertainties in the data and the model parameters, and to account for the prior knowledge about the sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to a sample of 5000 sources from the Swift-XRT catalog, and comparing the results with those obtained using a more traditional method based on spectral analysis. Our classification method achieved an accuracy of 95%, and was able to identify several new sources which were missed by the spectral analysis approach.

We also investigate the impact of different priors on the classification results, and show that the choice of prior can affect the classification performance. We propose a simple approach for selecting an appropriate prior based on the observed distribution of source properties.

Furthermore, we extend our classification method to the XMM-Newton catalog, which is larger and more complex than the Swift-XRT catalog. We demonstrate that our method can handle the increased complexity of the XMM-Newton data, and achieve comparable classification performance to that of the Swift-XRT catalog.

Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for future X-ray surveys, and highlight the potential of probabilistic classification methods for obtaining more accurate and reliable source catalogs. Our method can be readily applied to other astronomical datasets, and offers a valuable tool for the identification and classification of sources in large and complex data sets.

In conclusion, we have developed a powerful probabilistic classification method for X-ray sources, which has been applied successfully to both the Swift-XRT and XMM-Newton catalogs. Our method offers a reliable and efficient solution to the problem of source identification and classification in astronomical surveys, and has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the X-ray universe.","(343, 12)","Context. Serendipitous X-ray surveys have proven to be an efficient way to find rare objects,  such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, distinguishing between different types of X-ray sources can be challenging due to similarities in their spectral and temporal properties. In this paper, we aim to develop a probabilistic classification framework for X-ray sources using machine learning techniques.

Methodology. We employ a supervised learning approach, where we train a classifier on a labeled dataset of X-ray sources from the Swift-XRT (X-ray Telescope) and XMM- Newton (X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission) catalogs. Our dataset consists of 10,000 X-ray sources, each described by 20 features extracted from their spectra and light curves. We use a random forest classifier, which is robust to overfitting and can handle high-dimensional data. To evaluate the performance of our classifier, we use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).

Results. Our results show that the random forest classifier achieves an accuracy of 92% and an AUC-ROC of 95% on the test set. We also find that the classifier is able to distinguish between different types of AGN, such as Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies, with an accuracy of 90%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our classifier can identify GRBs with a precision of 85% and a recall of 80%.

Implications. The probabilistic classification framework developed in this paper has several implications for the study of X-ray sources. Firstly, it provides a robust and efficient way to classify X-ray sources, which can be used to identify rare objects such as GRBs and AGN. Secondly, our framework can be used to predict the probability of a source belonging to a particular class, which can be useful for follow-up observations and multi-wavelength studies. Finally, our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques in astronomy, particularly in the context of X-ray source classification.

Discussion. Our results are consistent with previous studies that have used machine learning techniques for X-ray source classification. However, our framework is more robust and efficient than previous approaches, thanks to the use of a random forest classifier and a larger dataset. We also discuss the limitations of our study, including the need for more labeled data and the potential for overfitting.

We present a quasi linear-time algorithm for Maximum Matching on distance-hereditary graphs and some of ","We present a quasi linear-time algorithm for Maximum Matching on distance-hereditary graphs and some of their generalizations. This improves on [Dragan, WG'97], who proposed such an algorithm for the subclass of (tent,hexahedron)-free distance-hereditary graphs. Furthermore, our result is derived from a more general one that is obtained for b-Matching. In the (unit cost) b-Matching problem, we are given a graph G = (V, E) together with a nonnegative integer capacity b v for every vertex v $\in$ V. The objective is to assign nonnegative integer weights (x e) e$\in$E so that: for every v $\in$ V the sum of the weights of its incident edges does not exceed b v , and e$\in$E x e is maximized. We present the first algorithm for solving b-Matching on cographs, distance-hereditary graphs and some of their generalizations in quasi linear time. For that, we use a decomposition algorithm that outputs for any graph G a collection of subgraphs of G with no edge-cutsets inducing a complete bipartite subgraph (a.k.a., splits). The latter collection is sometimes called a split decomposition of G. Furthermore, there exists a generic method in order to design graph algorithms based on split decomposition [Rao, DAM'08]. However, this technique only applies to ""localized"" problems: for which a ""best"" partial solution for any given subgraph in a split decomposition can be computed almost independently from the remaining of the graph. Such framework does not apply to matching problems since an augmenting path may cross the subgraphs arbitrarily. We introduce a new technique that somehow captures all the partial solutions for a given union of subgraphs in a split decomposition, in a compact and amenable way for algorithms - assuming some piecewise linear assumption holds on the value of such solutions. The latter assumption is shown to hold for b-Matching. Doing so, we prove that solving b-Matching on any pair G, b can be reduced in quasi linear-time to solving this problem on a collection of smaller graphs: that are obtained from the subgraphs in any split decomposition of G by replacing every vertex with a constant-size module. In particular, if G has a split decomposition where all subgraphs have order at most a fixed k, then we can solve b-Matching for G, b in O((k log 2 k)$\times$(m+n)$\times$log ||b|| 1)-time. This answers an open question of [Coudert et al., SODA'18].","(475, 14)","This paper presents a novel algorithm for computing b-Matching on both distance-hereditary and bounded split-width graphs. The proposed algorithm operates in quasi-linear time, which makes it very efficient and scalable for computing large-scale b-Matchings. 

First, we prove that the b-Matching problem on distance-hereditary graphs can be reduced to a maximum flow problem, using properties of this graph family. Then, we present an iterative algorithm that operates on a relaxation of the corresponding maximum flow instance, which takes O(n log n) time for n vertices. To further improve this algorithm, we develop a technique that simplifies the split decomposition, which leads to an O(n) time complexity as a special case when the graph has bounded split-width. 

To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments on various synthetic and real-world graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both running time and solution quality. 

Moreover, our algorithm is versatile and can be easily extended to handle other variants of b-Matching problems, such as fractional b-Matching and b-Matching with minimum degree constraints. 

In summary, this paper proposes a quasi-linear time algorithm for computing b-Matching on distance-hereditary and bounded split-width graphs.

Scientific progress increasingly depends on data management, particularly to clean and curate data so that ","Scientific progress increasingly depends on data management, particularly to clean and curate data so that it can be systematically analyzed and reused. A wealth of techniques for managing and curating data (and its provenance) have been proposed, largely in the database community. In particular, a number of influential papers have proposed collecting provenance information explaining where a piece of data was copied from, or what other records were used to derive it. Most of these techniques, however, exist only as research prototypes and are not available in mainstream database systems. This means scientists must either implement such techniques themselves or (all too often) go without.

This is essentially a code reuse problem: provenance techniques currently cannot be implemented reusably, only as ad hoc, usually unmaintained extensions to standard databases. An alternative, relatively unexplored approach is to support such techniques at a higher abstraction level, using metaprogramming or reflection techniques. Can advanced programming techniques make it easier to transfer provenance research results into practice?

We build on a recent approach called language-integrated provenance, which extends language-integrated query techniques with source-to-source query translations that record provenance. In previous work, a proof of concept was developed in a research programming language called Links, which supports sophisticated Web and database programming. In this paper, we show how to adapt this approach to work in Haskell building on top of the Database-Supported Haskell (DSH) library.

Even though it seemed clear in principle that Haskell's rich programming features ought to be sufficient, implementing language-integrated provenance in Haskell required overcoming a number of technical challenges due to interactions between these capabilities. Our implementation serves as a proof of concept showing how this combination of metaprogramming features can, for the first time, make data provenance facilities available to programmers as a library in a widely-used, general-purpose language.

In our work we were successful in implementing forms of provenance known as where-provenance and lineage. We have tested our implementation using a simple database and query set and established that the resulting queries are executed correctly on the database. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub.

Our work makes provenance tracking available to users of DSH at little cost.

Although Haskell is not widely used for scientific database development, our work suggests which languages features are necessary to support provenance as library. We also highlight how combining Haskell's advanced type programming features can lead to unexpected complications, which may motivate further research into type system expressiveness.","(455, 19)","In modern data processing and management systems, it is becoming increasingly important to keep track of the provenance, or lineage, of data. This information is essential for auditing data operations, debugging errors, and reproducing results. Language-integrated provenance is an approach that embeds provenance within programming languages.

This paper presents a language-integrated provenance system built within the Haskell programming language. Our system operates by equipping values with provenance tags that record the operations used to create them. Provenance can be accessed and manipulated through a set of primitives exposed by the system.

The key contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a light-weight, type-safe, and expressive language-integrated provenance system. We demonstrate the utility of our system through several case studies, including a differential privacy library, a machine learning system, and a web service application.

We evaluate the performance of our system and show that the overhead of provenance tracking is low, making it practical to use in real-world production systems. Our system has been integrated with several existing Haskell libraries and can be easily used by other developers.

In summary, our work introduces a novel approach to provenance tracking by embedding it within the programming language itself. We provide a complete implementation of a language-integrated provenance system in Haskell, which can be used by developers to trace and understand the lineage of the data they work with. Our system is lightweight, expressive, type-safe, and practical, making it a valuable tool for modern data processing and management systems.","(279, 13)","Scientific progress increasingly depends on data management, particularly to clean and curate data so that  accurate conclusions can be drawn from it. Provenance, which refers to the origin and history of data, plays a crucial role in this process. However, current approaches to provenance often rely on manual annotation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper presents a novel approach to language-integrated provenance (LIP) in Haskell, a statically typed, purely functional programming language. The goal of this research is to develop a system that automatically captures and represents the provenance of data in Haskell programs, enabling more efficient and reliable data management.

To address this challenge, we employed a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, we extended the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) to support LIP. This involved modifying the compiler's intermediate representation (IR) to include provenance information and developing a new type system that allows for the explicit representation of provenance. Secondly, we designed and implemented a set of libraries and tools that facilitate the capture and representation of provenance in Haskell programs. These libraries provide functions for annotating data with provenance information, as well as tools for visualizing and querying the provenance graph. Thirdly, we conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

We consider a class of mean field games in which the agents interact through both ","We consider a class of mean field games in which the agents interact through both their states and controls, and we focus on situations in which a generic agent tries to adjust her speed (control) to an average speed (the average is made in a neighborhood in the state space). In such cases, the monotonicity assumptions that are frequently made in the theory of mean field games do not hold, and uniqueness cannot be expected in general. Such model lead to systems of forward-backward nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations; the latter are supplemented with various kinds of boundary conditions, in particular Neumann-like boundary conditions stemming from reflection conditions on the underlying controled stochastic processes. The present work deals with numerical approximations of the above mentioned systems. After describing the finite difference scheme, we propose an iterative method for solving the systems of nonlinear equations that arise in the discrete setting; it combines a continuation method, Newton iterations and inner loops of a bigradient like solver. The numerical method is used for simulating two examples. We also make experiments on the behaviour of the iterative algorithm when the parameters of the model vary. The theory of mean field games, (MFGs for short), aims at studying deterministic or stochastic differential games (Nash equilibria) as the number of agents tends to infinity. It supposes that the rational agents are indistinguishable and individually have a negligible influence on the game, and that each individual strategy is influenced by some averages of quantities depending on the states (or the controls as in the present work) of the other agents. MFGs have been introduced in the pioneering works of J-M. Lasry and P-L. Lions [17, 18, 19]. Independently and at approximately the same time, the notion of mean field games arose in the engineering literature, see the works of M.Y. Huang, P.E. Caines and R.Malham{\'e} [14, 15]. The present work deals with numerical approximations of mean field games in which the agents interact through both their states and controls; it follows a more theoretical work by the second author, [16], which is devoted to the mathematical analysis of the related systems of nonlocal partial differential equations. There is not much literature on MFGs in which the agents also interact through their controls, see [13, 12, 8, 10, 7, 16]. To stress the fact that the latter situation is considered, we will sometimes use the terminology mean field games of control and the acronym MFGC.","(474, 16)","This research paper addresses the issue of solving mean field games of controls by finite difference approximations. Mean field game theory models large-scale multi-agent systems with a distinct feature: interactions between agents are taken into account explicitly. Due to their inherent complexity, these models require approximation techniques for efficient computation. Finite difference methods are a well-established numerical tool for solving partial differential equations and have been applied in various areas of science and engineering. We propose a new finite difference approximation for solving mean field games of controls that yields high accuracy and efficiency.

The proposed method utilizes the HJB (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman) equations to approximate the solutions of the mean field games problem. Our method involves discretization of the state space and time and utilizes a backward induction algorithm that propagates the solution backwards in time. The approximation is then obtained through solving a system of nonlinear equations.

We prove that our method converges in the limit of both time and space discretization. Additionally, we derive error estimates that describe the accuracy of our approximation. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method through numerical simulations in various settings with different sizes and degrees of complexity. Our results indicate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and computation time, particularly for large-scale systems.

The proposed finite difference approximation method has several potential applications in real-world problems. For instance, the method can be used to model traffic flow, energy management, finance, and various other multi-agent control systems. Our contributions to this field are twofold. First, we propose a new finite difference approximation for solving mean field games of controls that is both accurate and efficient. Second, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and computation time. 

We believe that our work opens up new opportunities for using finite difference methods to solve mean field games of controls and paves the way for further research in this area.

We consider a game-theoretic setting in which selfish individuals compete over resources of varying quality. ","We consider a game-theoretic setting in which selfish individuals compete over resources of varying quality. The motivating example is a group of animals that disperse over patches of food of different abundances. In such scenarios, individuals are biased towards selecting the higher quality patches, while, at the same time, aiming to avoid costly collisions or overlaps. Our goal is to investigate the impact of collision costs on the parallel coverage of resources by the whole group. Consider M sites, where a site x has value f(x). We think of f(x) as the reward associated with site x, and assume that if a single individual visits x exclusively, it receives this exact reward. Typically, we assume that if > 1 individuals visit x then each receives at most f(x). In particular, when competition costs are high, each individual might receive an amount strictly less than f(x), which could even be negative. Conversely, modeling cooperation at a site, we also consider cases where each one gets more than f(x). There are k identical players that compete over the rewards. They independently act in parallel, in a one-shot scenario, each specifying a single site to visit, without knowing which sites are explored by others. The group performance is evaluated by the expected coverage, defined as the sum of f(x) over all sites that are explored by at least one player. Since we assume that players cannot coordinate before choosing their site we focus on symmetric strategies. The main takeaway message of this paper is that the optimal symmetric coverage is expected to emerge when collision costs are relatively high, so that the following ""Judgment of Solomon"" type of rule holds: If a single player explores a site x then it gains its full reward f(x), but if several players explore it, then neither one receives any reward. Under this policy, it turns out that there exists a unique symmetric Nash Equilibrium strategy, which is, in fact, evolutionary stable. Moreover, this strategy yields the best possible coverage among all symmetric strategies. Viewing the coverage measure as the social welfare, this policy thus enjoys a (Symmetric) Price of Anarchy of precisely 1, whereas, in fact, any other congestion policy has a price strictly greater than 1. Our model falls within the scope of mechanism design, and more precisely in the area of incentivizing exploration.

It finds relevance in evolutionary ecology, and further connects to studies on Bayesian parallel search algorithms.","(482, 19)","This paper investigates how intense competition can drive selfish explorers to optimize coverage. A notable aspect in such environments is the pressure to balance exploration with exploitation, as explorers seek to cover as much territory as possible before competitors monopolize key regions. In this context, optimizing coverage represents a fundamental trade-off between risk-taking and safety.

The research examines coverage optimization strategies in a variety of environments, ranging from human-mediated landscapes to natural habitats. It provides a formal framework to characterize the dynamic interplay of explorers, competitors, and the environment, highlighting the impact of environmental heterogeneity, resource constraints, and diversity of strategies.

The study identifies several distinct mechanisms that underlie coverage optimization by selfish explorers. First, environmental heterogeneity can drive explorers to prioritize risky regions that maximize their informational gains, even if this entails higher risks. Second, competition can stimulate explorers to increase their exploration rates, leading to more efficient coverage. Third, a diversity of strategies can help explorers to avoid getting trapped in local optima and explore novel regions.

Empirical results show that coverage optimization by selfish explorers leads to increased foraging efficiency and broader exploration. Specifically, explorers who optimize their coverage are more likely to discover novel resources and out-compete rivals for expanding territories.

The findings suggest that competition can drive selfish explorers to adopt dynamic exploration-exploitation strategies that optimize coverage and lead to efficient resource acquisition. However, these benefits come at a cost: higher risks and increased pressure to balance exploration with safety. The study has implications for the understanding of exploration dynamics in competitive environments and the design of algorithms that incorporate exploration dynamics.

In conclusion, this paper contributes to the understanding of how intense competition can drive selfish explorers to optimize coverage. It provides a formal framework to characterize the dynamic interplay of explorers, competitors, and the environment. The research underscores the importance of balancing exploration with exploitation in the face of environmental heterogeneity, resource constraints, and diversity of strategies. The empirical results highlight the benefits of coverage optimization for efficient resource acquisition and the discovery of novel resources. Overall, these findings have implications for the understanding of exploration dynamics in competitive environments and the design of algorithms that incorporate exploration dynamics.","(407, 19)","We consider a game-theoretic setting in which selfish individuals compete over resources of varying quality.  In this context, we investigate how intense competition affects the behavior of ""selfish explorers,"" who seek to optimize their coverage of the available resources.  Specifically, we examine how the level of competition influences the explorers' tendency to focus on high-quality resources versus spreading their efforts across a broader range of resources.

Our model assumes that each explorer has a limited capacity to explore and exploit resources, and that the quality of each resource is known to the explorer.  We also assume that the explorers are rational and self-interested, seeking to maximize their own payoff.  In this setting, we analyze the Nash equilibrium of the game, where no explorer can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming all other explorers keep their strategies unchanged.

Our results show that as the level of competition increases, selfish explorers tend to focus more intensely on high-quality resources.  This is because, in a highly competitive environment, the payoff from exploiting high-quality resources is disproportionately large compared to the payoff from exploiting lower-quality resources.  As a result, explorers are incentivized to concentrate their efforts on the most valuable resources, even if it means leaving some lower-quality resources unexploited.

However, we also find that intense competition can lead to a phenomenon we term ""coverage collapse.""  In this scenario, explorers become so focused on high-quality resources that they fail to cover a significant portion of the available resources, leading to a decline in overall coverage.  This outcome is particularly pronounced when the distribution of resource quality is skewed, with a small number of extremely high-quality resources dominating the landscape.

Our findings have important implications for understanding the behavior of selfish explorers in competitive environments.  They suggest that, in the presence of intense competition, explorers may prioritize short-term gains over long-term benefits, such as maintaining a broad coverage of resources.

If selfish exploiters do not exploit the resource, then selfish explorers will exploit the resource. 
Thus, selfish exploitters have an incentive not to exploit the same resource as selfish explorers,

Aims: Stars twinkle because their light propagates through the atmosphere. The same phenomenon is expected ","Aims: Stars twinkle because their light propagates through the atmosphere.

The same phenomenon is expected at a longer time scale when the light of remote stars crosses an interstellar molecular cloud, but it has never been observed at optical wavelength. In a favorable case, the light of a background star can be subject to stochastic fluctuations on the order of a few percent at a characteristic time scale of a few minutes. Our ultimate aim is to discover or exclude these scintillation effects to estimate the contribution of molecular hydrogen to the Galactic baryonic hidden mass. This feasibility study is a pathfinder toward an observational strategy to search for scintillation, probing the sensitivity of future surveys and estimating the background level.

Methods: We searched for scintillation induced by molecular gas in visible dark nebulae as well as by hypothetical halo clumpuscules of cool molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H_2-He}$) during two nights. We took long series of 10s infrared exposures with the ESO-NTT telescope toward stellar populations located behind visible nebulae and toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We therefore searched for stars exhibiting stochastic flux variations similar to what is expected from the scintillation effect. According to our simulations of the scintillation process, this search should allow one to detect (stochastic) transverse gradients of column density in cool Galactic molecular clouds of order of $\sim 3\times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{g/cm^2/10\,000\,km}$. Results: We found one light-curve that is compatible with a strong scintillation effect through a turbulent structure characterized by a diffusion radius $R_{diff}<100\, km$ in the B68 nebula. Complementary observations are needed to clarify the status of this candidate, and no firm conclusion can be established from this single observation. We can also infer limits on the existence of turbulent dense cores (of number density $n>10^9\, cm^{-3}$) within the dark nebulae. Because no candidate is found toward the SMC, we are also able to establish upper limits on the contribution of gas clumpuscules to the Galactic halo mass. Conclusions: The limits set by this test do not seriously constrain the known models, but we show that the short time-scale monitoring for a few $10^6 star\times hour$ in the visible band with a $>4$ meter telescope and a fast readout camera should allow one to quantify the contribution of turbulent molecular gas to the Galactic halo. The LSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) is perfectly suited for this search.","(467, 15)","This research paper examines the use of interstellar scintillation to detect hidden gas in the galaxy, with a focus on the results obtained from a test using the NTT-SOFI detector. Interstellar scintillation is a phenomenon where stars appear to twinkle due to turbulence in the interstellar medium, and this effect can be used to identify gas clouds that are otherwise invisible to traditional telescope surveys. The NTT-SOFI detector, which is equipped with a near-infrared camera, was used to observe a number of stars in the galactic bulge over a series of nights, and the resulting scintillation data was analyzed to search for signs of hidden gas.

The study found that interstellar scintillation was indeed a useful technique for detecting galactic gas, and that the NTT-SOFI detector was capable of achieving the necessary sensitivity to detect even faint gas clouds. The researchers were able to identify several new gas clouds using this technique, and were also able to confirm the presence of known gas complexes. In addition, the scintillation data provided information about the physical properties of the gas, such as its temperature, density, and velocity, which is crucial for understanding its origin and evolution.

These results have important implications for our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way, as well as for the study of star formation and evolution. Hidden gas clouds are thought to play a critical role in the process of forming new stars, but they are difficult to detect using traditional methods, which rely on the detection of emissions from ionized gas or dust. Interstellar scintillation offers a new avenue for detecting such clouds, and this study demonstrates the potential of this technique for unlocking new insights into the workings of our galaxy.

Overall, the results obtained from this study highlight the importance of interstellar scintillation as a tool for exploring the hidden regions of the Milky Way. The NTT-SOFI detector proved to be an effective instrument for this task, and its use in future studies is likely to yield further discoveries about the structure and evolution of our galaxy. The findings of this study also underscore the need for continued technological innovation in the field of observational astronomy, as we strive to deepen our understanding of the universe around us.","(408, 12)","Aims: Stars twinkle because their light propagates through the atmosphere.

Let \K denote an algebraically closed field and let V denote a vector space over ","Let \K denote an algebraically closed field and let V denote a vector space over \K with finite positive dimension. We consider an ordered pair of linear transformations A:V\to V,A*:V \to V that satisfy the following conditions:(i)Each of A,A* is diagonalizable;(ii)there exists an ordering {V_i}_{i=0}^d of the eigenspaces of A such that A*V_i\subseteq V_{i-1}+V_i+V_{i+1} for 0\leq i\leq d, where V_{-1}=0 and V_{d+1}=0;(iii)there exists an ordering {V*_i}_{i=0}^\delta of the eigenspaces of A* such that A V*_i\subseteq V*_{i-1}+V*_i+V*_{i+1} for 0\leq i\leq\delta, where V*_{-1}=0 and V*_{\delta+1}=0;(iv)there does not exist a subspace W of V such that AW\subseteq W,A*W\subseteq W,W\neq 0,W\neq V. We call such a pair a tridiagonal pair on V. It is known that d=\delta; to avoid trivialities assume d\geq 1. We assume that A,A* belongs to a family of tridiagonal pairs said to have q-Racah type. This is the most general type of tridiagonal pair. Let {U_i}_{i=0}^d and {U_i^\Downarrow}_{i=0}^d denote the first and second split decompositions of V.

In an earlier paper we introduced the double lowering operator \psi:V\to V. One feature of \psi is that both \psi U_i\subseteq U_{i-1} and \psi U_i^\Downarrow\subseteq U_{i-1}^\Downarrow for 0\leq i\leq d. Define linear transformations K:V\to V and B:V\to V such that (K-q^{d-2i}I)U_i=0 and (B-q^{d-2i}I)U_i^\Downarrow=0 for 0\leq i\leq d. Our results are summarized as follows. Using \psi,K,B we obtain two actions of Uq(sl2) on V. For each of these Uq(sl2)-module structures, the Chevalley generator e acts as a scalar multiple of \psi. For each of the Uq(sl2)-module structures, we compute the action of the Casimir element on V. We show that these two actions agree. Using this fact, we express \psi as a rational function of K^{\pm 1},B^{\pm 1} in several ways. Eliminating \psi from these equations we find that K,B are related by a quadratic equation.","(475, 9)","This paper explores the relationship between tridiagonal pairs of $q$-Racah type, the double lowering operator $\psi$, and the quantum algebra $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. Tridiagonal pairs have been studied extensively in the literature, and have been shown to play an important role in the analysis of orthogonal polynomials and special functions. In particular, the $q$-Racah polynomials form a family of orthogonal polynomials that arise in many areas of mathematics and physics, and have been the subject of much recent analysis.

The main result of this paper is a new proof of a theorem relating the tridiagonal pairs of $q$-Racah type to the double lowering operator $\psi$. Specifically, we show that certain tridiagonal pairs of $q$-Racah type can be written in terms of the double lowering operator $\psi$ and a parameter $u$ that depends on the coefficients of the tridiagonal pair. This result has implications for the study of special functions and orthogonal polynomials, as the double lowering operator $\psi$ plays an important role in the theory of $q$-hypergeometric functions.

Moreover, we investigate the connections between these tridiagonal pairs, the double lowering operator $\psi$, and the quantum algebra $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. We show that the double lowering operator can be expressed in terms of the generators of the quantum algebra $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, and use this fact to derive new formulas and identities involving $q$-Racah polynomials and related functions. In particular, we derive a new identity involving a sum of products of $q$-Racah polynomials, which has applications in the study of orthogonal polynomials and special functions.

Context. Galaxy evolution and the effect of environment are most often studied using scaling relations ","Context. Galaxy evolution and the effect of environment are most often studied using scaling relations or some regression analyses around some given property. These approaches however do not take into account the complexity of the physics of the galaxies and their diversification. Aims. We here investigate the effect of cluster environment on the evolution of galaxies through multivariate unsupervised classification and phylogenetic analyses applied to two relatively large samples from the WINGS survey, one of cluster members and one of field galaxies (2624 and 1476 objects respectively).

Methods. These samples are the largest ones ever analysed with a phylogenetic approach in astrophysics. To be able to use the Maximum Parsimony (cladistics) method, we first performed a pre-clustering in 300 clusters with a hierarchical clustering technique, before applying it to these pre-clusters. All these computations used seven parameters: B-V, log(Re), nV , $\mu$e , H$\beta$ , D4000 , log(M *). Results. We have obtained a tree for the combined samples and do not find different evolutionary paths for cluster and field galaxies.

However, the cluster galaxies seem to have accelerated evolution in the sense they are statistically more diversified from a primitive common ancestor. The separate analyses show a hint for a slightly more regular evolution of the variables for the cluster galaxies, which may indicate they are more homogeneous as compared to field galaxies in the sense that the groups of the latter appear to have more specific properties. On the tree for the cluster galaxies, there is a separate branch which gathers rejunevated or stripped-off groups of galaxies. This branch is clearly visible on the colour-magnitude diagram, going back from the red sequence towards the blue one. On this diagram, the distribution and the evolutionary paths of galaxies are strikingly different for the two samples. Globally, we do not find any dominant variable able to explain either the groups or the tree structures. Rather, co-evolution appears everywhere, and could depend itself on environment or mass.

Conclusions. This study is another demonstration that unsupervised machine learning is able to go beyond the simple scaling relations by taking into account several properties together. The phylogenetic approach is invaluable to trace the evolutionary scenarii and project them onto any biavariate diagram without any a priori modelling. Our WINGS galaxies are all at low redshift, and we now need to go to higher redshfits to find more primitve galaxies and complete the map of the evolutionary paths of present day galaxies.","(461, 22)","This research paper presents a Maximum Parsimony analysis aiming to investigate the impact of environmental factors on the evolution of galaxies. To achieve this, we used a comprehensive data set of observed properties of galaxies from a variety of environments, including clusters, groups, and the field.

Our analysis focuses on key characteristics that are known to be relevant to galaxy formation and evolution, such as stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity, and morphology. By employing a Maximum Parsimony approach, we aim to find the most likely scenario for how environmental variables affect these characteristics.

Our results indicate that the environment has a significant impact on the evolution of galaxies, especially on their morphology and star formation activity. Specifically, we find strong evidence supporting enhanced star formation in galaxies residing in high-density environments, which is consistent with the well-known phenomenon of galaxy mergers triggered by tidal interactions. In contrast, galaxies in low-density environments are more likely to have quenched star formation and feature early-type morphologies.

Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the effect of the environment on galaxy metallicity is less clear-cut and depends on a variety of factors, including redshift, galaxy mass, and the environmental density.

Overall, this study provides new insights into the complex interplay between environmental factors and galaxy evolution and highlights the importance of taking into account both internal and external processes that shape the properties of galaxies. Our Maximum Parsimony approach has allowed us to derive robust conclusions from the available data and to identify key avenues for future investigations in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.","(288, 10)","Context. Galaxy evolution and the effect of environment are most often studied using scaling relations  such as the Tully-Fisher relation (Tully & Fisher, 1977) and the Faber-Jackson relation (Faber & Jackson, 1976). However, these relations do not provide insight into the underlying physical processes driving galaxy evolution. This study aims to address this limitation by employing a maximum parsimony analysis to investigate the effect of environment on galaxy evolution.

Objectives. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the environment plays a significant role in shaping the evolution of galaxies. A secondary objective is to identify the specific physical processes that contribute to galaxy evolution in different environments.

Methodology. We used a sample of 1000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12 (Alam et al., 2015). The galaxies were selected based on their morphological type, with a focus on spiral and elliptical galaxies. We employed a maximum parsimony algorithm to analyze the relationships between galaxy properties, such as stellar mass, star formation rate, and metallicity, and environmental factors, such as galaxy density and distance to the nearest neighbor.

Results. Our analysis revealed a significant correlation between galaxy properties and environmental factors. Specifically, we found that galaxies in denser environments tend to have higher stellar masses, lower star formation rates, and higher metallicities compared to galaxies in less dense environments. These results suggest that the environment plays a crucial role in shaping galaxy evolution.

Discussion. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown a relationship between galaxy properties and environment (e.g., Dressler, 1980; Kauffmann et al., 2003). However, our maximum parsimony analysis provides a more nuanced understanding of the physical processes underlying galaxy evolution. For example, we found that galaxy interactions and mergers are more common in denser environments, which can lead to the suppression of star formation and the enhancement of metallicity.

Degenerate ignition of helium in low-mass stars at the end of the red giant branch ","Degenerate ignition of helium in low-mass stars at the end of the red giant branch phase leads to dynamic convection in their helium cores. One-dimensional (1D) stellar modeling of this intrinsically multi-dimensional dynamic event is likely to be inadequate. Previous hydrodynamic simulations imply that the single convection zone in the helium core of metal-rich Pop I stars grows during the flash on a dynamic timescale. This may lead to hydrogen injection into the core, and a double convection zone structure as known from one-dimensional core helium flash simulations of low-mass Pop III stars. We perform hydrodynamic simulations of the core helium flash in two and three dimensions to better constrain the nature of these events. To this end we study the hydrodynamics of convection within the helium cores of a 1.25 \Msun metal-rich Pop I star (Z=0.02), and a 0.85 \Msun metal-free Pop III star (Z=0) near the peak of the flash. These models possess single and double convection zones, respectively. We use 1D stellar models of the core helium flash computed with state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes as initial models for our multidimensional hydrodynamic study, and simulate the evolution of these models with the Riemann solver based hydrodynamics code Herakles which integrates the Euler equations coupled with source terms corresponding to gravity and nuclear burning. The hydrodynamic simulation of the Pop I model involving a single convection zone covers 27 hours of stellar evolution, while the first hydrodynamic simulations of a double convection zone, in the Pop III model, span 1.8 hours of stellar life. We find differences between the predictions of mixing length theory and our hydrodynamic simulations. The simulation of the single convection zone in the Pop I model shows a strong growth of the size of the convection zone due to turbulent entrainment. Hence we predict that for the Pop I model a hydrogen injection phase (i.e. hydrogen injection into the helium core) will commence after about 23 days, which should eventually lead to a double convection zone structure known from 1D stellar modeling of low-mass Pop III stars. Our two and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the double (Pop III) convection zone model show that the velocity field in the convection zones is different from that predicted by stellar evolutionary calculations.

The simulations suggest that the double convection zone decays quickly, the flow eventually being dominated by internal gravity waves.","(427, 15)","The core helium flash (CHF) is a brief but intense phase that occurs in the evolution of low-mass stars. Despite being a well-studied phenomenon, the details of the CHF in different stellar populations remain an active area of research. In particular, the differences between the CHF in stars born in the early universe, known as Population III (Pop III) stars, and those born later, known as Pop I or II stars, are of great interest.

In this paper, we present a detailed study of the CHF in both Pop I/II and Pop III stars using numerical simulations. We find that while the duration and strength of the CHF are similar between the two populations, there are significant differences in the resultant evolution of the stars. In Pop III stars, the CHF triggers rapid mass loss, stripping off the outer envelope of the star and exposing its helium core. This leads to the formation of hot, blue stars that are much more massive than their Pop I/II counterparts.

Furthermore, we find that the CHF can have important consequences for the chemical evolution of galaxies. As Pop III stars are believed to be responsible for the first round of star formation in the universe, their rapid evolution due to the CHF can have significant effects on the metallicity of later generations of stars. Our simulations show that the early enrichment of galaxies with metals can be greatly enhanced by the CHF in Pop III stars.

Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering the differences between Pop I/II and Pop III stars when studying stellar evolution. The CHF is a crucial phase in the evolution of low-mass stars, and understanding its effects on different stellar populations can provide valuable insights into the early universe and galactic chemical evolution.","(327, 12)","Degenerate ignition of helium in low-mass stars at the end of the red giant branch  (helium flash) is a fundamental process in stellar evolution.

This paper revisits the CHF in the context of Pop I, II, and III stars, with a focus on the impact of metallicity on the helium flash.

We employ a suite of one-dimensional stellar evolution models, spanning a range of metallicities from Z = 0.02 (Pop I) to Z = 10^(-4) (Pop III), to investigate the CHF. Our models are computed using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, which allows for a self-consistent treatment of nuclear burning, convection, and mass loss. We consider a range of initial masses, from 0.8 to 2.0 solar masses (M), to account for the diversity of low-mass stars in the Galaxy.

Our results show that the CHF is significantly affected by metallicity. In Pop I stars, the CHF is characterized by a brief period of helium burning in the core, followed by a rapid expansion of the star into the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. In contrast, Pop II and III stars exhibit a more complex behavior, with the CHF leading to a prolonged period of helium burning and a subsequent contraction of the core. This difference in behavior is attributed to the reduced opacity in metal-poor stars, which allows for more efficient helium burning and a greater degree of core contraction.

We find that the CHF in Pop III stars is particularly interesting, as it leads to the formation of a degenerate helium core with a mass of approximately 0.1 M. This core is stable against further helium burning and can persist for billions of years, potentially influencing the subsequent evolution of the star. Our results also suggest that the CHF may play a key role in the formation of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, which are characterized by an overabundance of carbon and other heavy elements.

In the frame of the test of NISP instrument for ESA Euclid mission, the question ","In the frame of the test of NISP instrument for ESA Euclid mission, the question was raised to perform a metrology measurement of different components during the thermal vacuum test of NISP instrument. NISP will be tested at Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM) in ERIOS chamber under vacuum and thermal conditions in order to qualify the instrument in its operating environment and to perform the final acceptance test before delivery to the payload. One of the main objectives of the test campaign will be the measurement of the focus position of NISP image plane with respect to the EUCLID object plane. To simulate the EUCLID object plane, a telescope simulator with a very well know focal distance will be installed in front of NISP into ERIOS chamber. We need to measure at cold and vacuum the position of reflectors installed on NISP instrument and the telescope simulator. From these measurements, we will provide at operational temperature the measurement of references frames set on the telescope simulator and NISP, the knowledge of the coordinates of the object point source provided by the telescope simulator and the measurement of the angle between the telescope simulator optical axis and NISP optical axis. In this context, we have developed a metrology method based on the use of a laser tracker to measure the position of the reflectors inside ERIOS. The laser tracker is installed outside the vacuum chamber and measure through a curved window reflectors put inside the chamber either at ambient pressure or vacuum pressure. Several tests campaigns have been done at LAM to demonstrate the measurement performance with this configuration. Using a well know reflectors configuration, we show that it is possible to correct the laser tracker measurement from the window disturbances and from the vacuum impact. A corrective term is applied to the data and allows retrieving the real coordinates of the reflectors with a bias lower than 30$\mu$m, which is lower than the laser tracker measurement uncertainties estimated at 60$\mu$m. No additional error term of the laser tracker measurement is observed when using the laser tracker with the curved window and in vacuum, comparing with a classical use of the laser tracker. With these test campaign, we have been able to demonstrate the possibility to use a laser tracker to measure in real time during a vacuum thermal test the position of different mechanical parts into a vacuum chamber with an accuracy better than 60$\mu$m.","(441, 13)","The success of astronomical observational missions partly relies on the precision of optical instruments and their performance under extreme environmental conditions.

The Austre Lov\'enbreen is a 4.6 km2 glacier on the Archipelago of Svalbard (79 degrees ","The Austre Lov\'enbreen is a 4.6 km2 glacier on the Archipelago of Svalbard (79 degrees N) that has been surveyed over the last 47 years in order of monitoring in particular the glacier evolution and associated hydrological phenomena in the context of nowadays global warming. A three-week field survey over April 2010 allowed for the acquisition of a dense mesh of Ground-penetrating Radar (GPR) data with an average of 14683 points per km2 (67542 points total) on the glacier surface. The profiles were acquired using a Mala equipment with 100 MHz antennas, towed slowly enough to record on average every 0.3 m, a trace long enough to sound down to 189 m of ice. One profile was repeated with 50 MHz antenna to improve electromagnetic wave propagation depth in scattering media observed in the cirques closest to the slopes. The GPR was coupled to a GPS system to position traces. Each profile has been manually edited using standard GPR data processing including migration, to pick the reflection arrival time from the ice-bedrock interface. Snow cover was evaluated through 42 snow drilling measurements regularly spaced to cover all the glacier. These data were acquired at the time of the GPR survey and subsequently spatially interpolated using ordinary kriging. Using a snow velocity of 0.22 m/ns, the snow thickness was converted to electromagnetic wave travel-times and subtracted from the picked travel-times to the ice-bedrock interface. The resulting travel-times were converted to ice thickness using a velocity of 0.17 m/ns. The velocity uncertainty is discussed from a common mid-point profile analysis. A total of 67542 georeferenced data points with GPR-derived ice thicknesses, in addition to a glacier boundary line derived from satellite images taken during summer, were interpolated over the entire glacier surface using kriging with a 10 m grid size. Some uncertainty analysis were carried on and we calculated an averaged ice thickness of 76 m and a maximum depth of 164 m with a relative error of 11.9%. The volume of the glacier is derived as 0.3487$\pm$0.041 km3. Finally a 10-m grid map of the bedrock topography was derived by subtracting the ice thicknesses from a dual-frequency GPS-derived digital elevation model of the surface. These two datasets are the first step for modelling thermal evolution of the glacier and its bedrock, as well as the main hydrological network.","(421, 16)","This study investigates the use of Ground-penetrating Radar (GPR) for deriving the ice thickness, glacier volume, and bedrock morphology of the Austre Lovénbreen Glacier in Svalbard.

The methodology involved the deployment of GPR on the glacier ice surface and analysis of the signals to determine the thickness of the ice and the topography of the bedrock. In addition, the glacier volume was estimated using a combination of GPR-derived ice thickness and digital elevation models. The study found that the glacier showed an overall thinning trend from 2013 to 2019.

We present multi-component photoionization models allowing for local density inhomogeneities in the NLR to interpret ","We present multi-component photoionization models allowing for local density inhomogeneities in the NLR to interpret the emission line spectra of Seyfert 2 galaxies. This approach leads to a successful match of a large set of line intensities from the UV to the NIR. In particular, the hitherto elusive NIR features [SIII]9062+9531 as well as high-ionization lines like [FeVII] are consistently fitted. The predictions of CIII] and CIV are considerably improved. From the detailed analysis of single-component photoionization models we derive the minimal radial extent of the NLR and the necessary span in density. Furthermore, we determine constraints on suggestions made about the role of matter-bounded clouds, and on proposed explanations for large [OIII]4363/5007 ratios (the so-called `temperature problem'), and assess the usability of some emission-line ratios as indicators of the ionization parameter. We find that a systematic variation of the cloud column densities in a population of matter-bounded clouds is inconsistent with the trends and correlations exhibited by the emission lines in the diagnostic diagrams.

Concerning the temperature problem, the only possibility that leads to an overall consistency with the strengths of all other observed emission lines is subsolar metal abundances (as compared to e.g. the presence of dust, the existence of a high-density component, or matter-bounded clouds). In addition, the consequences of the presence of (Galactic-ISM-like) dust internal to the clouds were investigated. These models alleviate the [OIII]-ratio problem but did not lead to overall consistent fits. In our final model series, the NLR is composed of a mixture of metal-depleted (0.5 x solar) clouds with a radius-independent range in densities (10^2 to 10^5 cm^-3) distributed over a range of distances from the nucleus (galactocentric radii from at least $\sim$ 10^{20} cm to 10^{21.5} cm, for $Q_{tot} = 10^{54}$ s^{-1}). In order to encompass the observed range of each line intensity relative to H$\beta$, it turns out to be necessary to vary the spectral energy distribution incident on the clouds, qualitatively confirming the findings of Ho et al. (1993). We found a successful continuum sequence by adding an increasing contribution of a hot black body ($T \approx 200000$ K) to a steep powerlaw ($\alpha_{uv-x} \approx -2$). These continua imply that low and high-excitation objects differ in the strength but not in the basic shape of the EUV bump.","(468, 16)","Seyfert 2 galaxies are a class of active galaxies that feature strong emission lines in their spectra. The interpretation of such spectra presents a challenge for astronomers who seek to understand the physical processes that produce these lines. Multi-component photoionization models have been proposed as a tool to clarify these complex spectra, and this paper presents new results from such models.

In this study, we examine Seyfert 2 galaxy spectra using a multi-component photoionization model based on the cloudy code. This allows us to study the contributions of different ionizing sources, such as the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and star-forming regions, to the overall spectrum. This type of analysis is important because it can help us to estimate the AGN luminosity and other properties of the galaxy.

Our results show that multi-component models can successfully reproduce the emission line spectra of Seyfert 2 galaxies. We find that AGN radiation dominates the ionization state of the gas in these galaxies, but that the contribution of star formation can also be significant. We identify a number of emission lines that appear to be influenced by both AGN and star formation.

The implications of our findings are significant for our understanding of Seyfert 2 galaxies. Our results suggest that the AGN luminosity is an important factor in shaping the emission line spectrum, and that multi-component models are necessary to obtain accurate estimates of this quantity. In addition, we find that star formation can be an important source of ionizing radiation in these galaxies, which has implications for our understanding of the interplay between AGN and star formation.

Overall, our study demonstrates the power of multi-component photoionization models for interpreting the complex line spectra of Seyfert 2 galaxies. Our results provide new insights into the physical processes that produce these spectra and contribute to our understanding of the evolution of active galaxies.","(333, 14)","We present multi-component photoionization models allowing for local density inhomogeneities in the NLR to interpret 1D and 2D emission line spectra of a sample of Seyfert-2 (Sy2) galaxies.

Our sample consists of 15 Sy2 galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).

Our results show that the NLR of Sy2 galaxies can be well-represented by a combination of three distinct components: a high-density, high-ionization component; a low-density, low-ionization component; and a warm, dusty component.

When we consider a proper holomorphic map \ $\tilde{f}: X \to C$ \ of a ","When we consider a proper holomorphic map \ $\tilde{f}: X \to C$ \ of a complex manifold \ $X$ \ on a smooth complex curve \ $C$ \ with a critical value at a point \ $0$ \ in \ $C$, the choice of a local coordinate near this point allows to dispose of an holomorphic function \ $f$. Then we may construct, using this function, an (a,b)-modules structure on the cohomology sheaves of the formal completion (in \ $f$) \ of the complex of sheaves \ $(Ker\, df^{\bullet},d^{\bullet})$. These (a,b)-modules represent a filtered version of the Gauss-Manin connection of \ $f$. The most simple example of this construction is the Brieskorn module (see [Br.70]) of a function with an isolated singular point. See [B.08] for the case of a 1-dimensional critical locus. But it is clear that this construction depends seriously on the choice of the function \ $f$ \ that is to say on the choice of the local coordinate near the critical point \ $0$ \ in the complex curve \ $C$. The aim of the present paper is to study the behaviour of such constructions when we make a change of local coordinate near the origin. We consider the case of \ $[\lambda]-$primitive frescos, which are monogenic geometric (a,b)-modules corresponding to a minimal filtered differential equation associated to a relative de Rham cohomology class on \ $X$ \ (see [B.09-a] and [B.09-b]). An holomorphic parameter is a function on the set of isomorphism classes of frescos which behave holomorphically in an holomorphic family of frescos. In general, an holomorphic parameter is not invariant by a change of variable, but we prove a theorem of stability of holomorphic families of frescos by a change of variable and it implies that an holomorphic parameter gives again an holomorphic parameter by a change of variable. We construct here two different kinds of holomorphic parameters which are (quasi-)invariant by change of variable. The first kind is associated to Jordan blocks of the monodromy with size at least two. The second kind is associated to the semi-simple part of the monodromy and look like some ""cross ratio"" of eigenvectors. They allow, in the situation describe above, to associate to a given (vanishing) relative de Rham cohomology class some numbers, which will depend holomorphically of our data, and are independant of the choice of the local coordinate near \ $0$ \ to study the Gauss-Manin connection of this degeneration of compact complex manifolds.","(520, 14)","This paper explores the construction of holomorphic parameters which are invariant under change of variable in the Gauss-Manin connection of a holomorphic map to a disc. The study of invariants under holomorphic mappings has been a topic of interest for many years, and this work builds upon previous research by addressing the specific case of the Gauss-Manin connection.

Through a rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove the existence of such parameters under certain conditions. These conditions are related to the geometry of the holomorphic map and its associated metric properties. We also provide explicit formulas for the computation of these invariants in particular cases.

The implications of this research are significant both in the mathematical and physical domains. From a mathematical point of view, the construction of holomorphic parameters invariant under change of variable can have applications in algebraic geometry, complex analysis, and differential equations. From a physical perspective, these invariants can be used to study the behavior of complex systems, such as the interaction between electric fields and materials with holomorphic properties.

Our findings represent a novel contribution to the field of holomorphic invariants and provide a fruitful ground for further research. We expect that our results will stimulate the development of new concepts and tools in the study of holomorphic mappings, and contribute to a deeper understanding of the Gauss-Manin connection and its applications in various areas of mathematics and physics.","(250, 10)","When we consider a proper holomorphic map \ $\tilde{f}: X \to C$ \ of a 1-dimensional complex manifold $X$ to the unit disc $C$ \subset \mathbb{C}$, we are interested in understanding the behavior of its Gauss-Manin connection.

Context: Database-backed applications often run queries with more authority than necessary. Since programs can access ","Context: Database-backed applications often run queries with more authority than necessary. Since programs can access more data than they legitimately need, flaws in security checks at the application level can enable malicious or buggy code to view or modify data in violation of intended access control policies.

Inquiry: Although database management systems provide tools to control access to data, these tools are not well-suited for modern applications which often have many users and consist of many different software components. First, databases are unaware of application users, and creating a new database user for each application user is impractical for applications with many users.

Second, different components of the same application may require different authority, which would require creating different database users for different software components. Thus, it is difficult to use existing tools to properly limit the authority an application has when executing queries. For this reason, we consider a new, language-based approach to application-specific database security.

Approach: Prior work has addressed the difficulty of running applications with least privilege using capability-based security and software contracts, which we adapt to the setting of database-backed applications.

Knowledge: This paper's main contribution is the design and implementation of ShillDB, a language for writing secure database-backed applications. ShillDB enables reasoning about database access at the language level through capabilities, which limit which database tables a program can access, and contracts, which limit what operations a program can perform on those tables.

ShillDB contracts are expressed as part of function interfaces, making it easy to specify different access control policies for different components.

Contracts act as executable security documentation for ShillDB programs and are enforced by the language runtime. Further, ShillDB provides database access control guarantees independent of (and in addition to) the security mechanisms of the underlying database management system.

Grounding: We have implemented a prototype of ShillDB and have used it to implement the backend for a lending library reservation system with contracts for each endpoint to evaluate the performance and usability of ShillDB.

Further, we benchmark individual database operations in ShillDB to better understand the language's performance overhead.

Importance: Our experience indicates that ShillDB is a practical language for enforcing database access control policies in realistic, multi-user applications and has reasonable performance overhead. ShillDB allows developers to reason about security at the component level, safely compose components, and reuse third-party components with their own application-specific database security policies.","(444, 17)","Fine-grained, language-based access control for database-backed applications refers to a security mechanism that offers database access based on predefined language constructs. The aim of this research paper is to investigate the effectiveness of fine-grained access control in enforcing data privacy and security. 

This study was motivated by the need to control and manage access to sensitive data stored in database-backed applications. Malicious actors continually look for ways to exploit vulnerabilities in software systems to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. Access control, therefore, is necessary to prevent unauthorized access and protect data privacy.

We conducted a comprehensive review of the existing literature on access control mechanisms for database-backed applications. Existing approaches rely on coarse-grained access control that grants privileges to large user groups. However, as databases become more complex and contain more sensitive information, the need for more fine-grained access control becomes critical.

We propose a fine-grained access control mechanism that is based on the constructs of the programming language used to develop the application. This approach leverages the familiarity of developers with the programming language and its constructs to enforce access control. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a prototype application that implements our mechanism.

The prototype application was subject to various simulated attack scenarios to test the security and effectiveness of the fine-grained access control mechanism. The results of our experiments show that fine-grained access control based on language constructs effectively prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Furthermore, our proposed mechanism does not require extensive modifications to the application code or the database structure. Instead, it uses the existing programming constructs, making it easier to integrate with existing applications. 

In summary, the proposed fine-grained, language-based access control mechanism offers significant improvements over the traditional coarse-grained access control. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is effective in enforcing data privacy and security and does not require extensive changes to the database schema. We believe that our approach could be easily adopted by software developers to improve the security of their applications and databases.","(367, 18)","Context: Database-backed applications often run queries with more authority than necessary. Since programs can access 100% of the data in the database, there is a need for fine-grained, language-based access control.

Methodology: This paper proposes a novel approach to fine-grained language-based access control (FLAC) for database-backed applications. FLAC uses a combination of static analysis and runtime checks to enforce access control policies at the source code level. The proposed system consists of three main components: a policy engine, a static analyzer, and a runtime checker.

Runtime Checker: The runtime checker is responsible for enforcing access control policies at runtime. It monitors the execution of the application and checks if the current user has the necessary permissions to access the requested data.

Findings: Our evaluation shows that FLAC is effective in preventing access control violations in database-backed applications. We tested FLAC on a set of real-world applications and found that it reduced the number of access control violations by up to 90%. We also found that FLAC had a negligible impact on performance, with an average overhead of less than 1%.

Implications: FLAC has several implications for the development and deployment of database-backed applications. Firstly, it provides a fine-grained way to control access to sensitive data, reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Secondly, it allows developers to define access control policies in a declarative way, making it easier to manage complex access control scenarios.

Interest in the application of engineering methods to problems in congenital heart disease has gained ","Interest in the application of engineering methods to problems in congenital heart disease has gained increased popularity over the past decade. The use of computational simulation to examine common clinical problems including single ventricle physiology and the associated surgical approaches, the effects of pacemaker implantation on vascular occlusion, or delineation of the biomechanical effects of implanted medical devices is now routinely appearing in clinical journals within all pediatric cardiovascular subspecialties. In practice, such collaboration can only work if both communities understand each other's methods and their limitations. This paper is intended to facilitate this communication by presenting in the context of congenital heart disease (CHD) the main steps involved in performing computational simulation-from the selection of an appropriate clinical question/problem to understanding the computational results, and all of the ""black boxes"" in between. We examine the current state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For example, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based on numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a model with a simple ""click of a button"". The creation of a faithful, representative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires skilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging modality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the technical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most commonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence, Navier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in running the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of boundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current areas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally, examples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an opportunity to ""acquire"" data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with essentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation examples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted postoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented.

The need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted results are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily application of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely remains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both clinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever before and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time.","(452, 16)","Congenital heart disease, or CHD, is a challenging condition that affects an increasing number of people worldwide. While traditional diagnostic techniques such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging can provide valuable insights into CHD, they are limited by a number of factors, including their invasiveness and their inability to comprehensively evaluate the complex hemodynamic changes that occur in patients with CHD.

In recent years, computational simulation has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the pathophysiology of CHD. By using computer models to simulate the flow of blood through the heart and its associated vessels, clinicians can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of CHD on cardiovascular function. This knowledge can inform clinical decision-making and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

While computational simulation has many potential benefits, it can be a complex and technical field, making it challenging for clinicians without a background in computer science or engineering to fully appreciate its potential. This paper serves as a primer on computational simulation for clinicians who are interested in utilizing this powerful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of CHD.

The paper begins by introducing the basics of computational simulation, including the different types of models that are available and the parameters that can be adjusted to simulate different physiological conditions. The authors then go on to discuss how computational simulation can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatments for CHD, including surgical interventions and medication therapies.

One of the key challenges of using computational simulation in clinical practice is ensuring that the models used accurately reflect the physiological conditions of the patient being evaluated. To address this issue, the authors provide guidance on how to validate simulation models and ensure that they produce reliable results.

Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of computational simulation and the potential avenues for future development in this field. Despite its potential benefits, computational simulation is not a silver bullet for CHD diagnosis and treatment, and clinicians must be aware of its limitations in order to make informed decisions about its use.

In conclusion, this paper provides a comprehensive introduction to computational simulation for clinicians who are interested in utilizing this powerful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of CHD. By providing a detailed overview of the basics of simulation and its potential applications in clinical practice, the authors hope to encourage more clinicians to explore the potential of this exciting field.","(435, 15)","Interest in the application of engineering methods to problems in congenital heart disease has gained  momentum in recent years, driven in part by advances in computational power and imaging modalities.

Let $k$ be a field and $G$ be a finite group acting on the rational ","Let $k$ be a field and $G$ be a finite group acting on the rational function field $k(x_g : g\in G)$ by $k$-automorphisms defined as $h(x_g)=x_{hg}$ for any $g,h\in G$. We denote the fixed field $k(x_g : g\in G)^G$ by $k(G)$. Noether's problem asks whether $k(G)$ is rational (= purely transcendental) over $k$. It is well-known that if $C(G)$ is stably rational over $C$, then all the unramified cohomology groups $H_[nr}^i(C(G),Q/Z)=0$ for $i \ge 2$. Hoshi, Kang and Kunyavskii [HKK] showed that, for a $p$-group of order $p^5$ ($p$: an odd prime number), $H_[nr}^2(C(G),Q/Z)\neq 0$ if and only if $G$ belongs to the isoclinism family $\Phi_{10}$. When $p$ is an odd prime number, Peyre [Pe3] and Hoshi, Kang and Yamasaki [HKY1] exhibit some $p$-groups $G$ which are of the form of a central extension of certain elementary abelian $p$-group by another one with $H_[nr}^2(C(G),Q/Z)=0$ and $H_[nr}^3(C(G),Q/Z)\neq 0$. However, it is difficult to tell whether $H_[nr}^3(C(G),Q/Z)$ is non-trivial if $G$ is an arbitrary finite group. In this paper, we are able to determine $H_[nr}^3(C(G),Q/Z)$ where $G$ is any group of order $p^5$ with $p=3, 5, 7$.

Theorem 1. Let $G$ be a group of order $3^5$. Then $H_[nr}^3(C(G),Q/Z)\neq 0$ if and only if $G$ belongs to $\Phi_7$. Theorem 2. If $G$ is a group of order $3^5$, then the fixed field $C(G)$ is rational if and only if $G$ does not belong to $\Phi_{7}$ and $\Phi_{10}$. Theorem 3. Let $G$ be a group of order $5^5$ or $7^5$. Then $H_[nr}^3(C(G),Q/Z)\neq 0$ if and only if $G$ belongs to $\Phi_6$, $\Phi_7$ or $\Phi_{10}$. Theorem 4. If $G$ is the alternating group $A_n$, the Mathieu group $M_{11}$, $M_{12}$, the Janko group $J_1$ or the group $PSL_2(F_q)$, $SL_2(F_q)$, $PGL_2(F_q)$ (where $q$ is a prime power), then $H_[nr}^d(C(G),Q/Z)=0$ for any $d\ge 2$. Besides the degree three unramified cohomology groups, we compute also the stable cohomology groups.","(661, 19)","In this paper, we investigate Noether's problem for groups of order $243$ by studying degree three unramified cohomology groups. The problem asks whether or not a polynomial ring in several variables over a field has a finite length as a module over itself, and in this case, we consider polynomial rings over the finite field with 243 elements. 

Our main result is a proof that Noether's problem is solvable for groups of order $243$. To achieve this, we first introduce and study the notion of unramified cohomology groups. We then focus on degree three unramified cohomology groups, which we call $H^3(U;A)$, where $U$ is a finite $p$-group and $A$ is an $U$-module. We show that, in our case, the degree three unramified cohomology groups are very closely related to the module lengths of polynomial rings associated with certain groups.

In the second part of the paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the cohomology groups in question. We prove that they can be written as a direct sum of indecomposable modules, and we provide formulas for computing their ranks and dimensions. We also give detailed examples of how to apply this machinery to specific groups of order $243$.

Our results generalize and extend previous work on Noether's problem for groups of smaller orders, and are important for understanding the behavior of module lengths of polynomial rings in general. They also shed light on the structure of cohomology groups in general, providing new insight into this fundamental area of algebraic topology.

In conclusion, our paper provides a rigorous investigation into the solvability of Noether's problem for groups of order $243$ through the lens of degree three unramified cohomology groups. We introduce new machinery for the computation and analysis of these cohomology groups, and show that they are closely related to the module lengths of polynomial rings for certain groups. This work contributes to the broader program of understanding the interplay between algebraic topology, commutative algebra, and group theory.","(386, 14)","Let $k$ be a field and $G$ be a finite group acting on the rational 3-dimensional space $\mathbb{A}^3$ over $k$. In this paper, we investigate the degree three unramified Galois cohomology groups $H^3_{\text{nr}}(G, k^\times)$ and their relation to Noether's problem. Specifically, we focus on the case where the order of $G$ is $243 = 3^5$.

Noether's problem, first posed by Emmy Noether in the early 20th century, asks whether every finite group can be realized as the Galois group of a separable extension of rational numbers. This problem has far-reaching implications in number theory, algebraic geometry, and Galois theory. In particular, it has significant consequences for our understanding of the structure of finite groups and their actions on algebraic varieties.

To tackle this problem, we employ a combination of techniques from algebraic geometry, Galois theory, and cohomology theory. We begin by considering the action of $G$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$, the projective closure of $\mathbb{R}^3$. This action induces a homomorphism $\rho: G \to \text{PGL}_3(k)$. We then examine the kernel of this homomorphism, denoted by $\text{Ker}(\rho)$, which is a normal subgroup of $G$.

Our main goal is to determine the structure of the quotient group $\text{Im}(\rho) = G / \text{Ker}( \rho)$. To achieve this, we use the fact that $\text{Im}( \rho)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the automorphism group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ of a curve $\mathcal{C}$ defined over $k$. By analyzing the properties of this curve and its automorphism group, we are able to deduce information about the structure of $\text{ Im}(\rho)$.

In particular, we show that if $G$ is a group of order $243$, then $\text{ Im}( \rho)$ must be isomorphic to either the alternating group $A_5$ or the symmetric group $S_5$.

Mapping forest aboveground biomass (AGB) has become an important task, particularly for the reporting of ","Mapping forest aboveground biomass (AGB) has become an important task, particularly for the reporting of carbon stocks and changes. AGB can be mapped using synthetic aperture radar data (SAR) or passive optical data. However, these data are insensitive to high AGB levels (\textgreater{}150 Mg/ha, and \textgreater{}300 Mg/ha for P-band), which are commonly found in tropical forests. Studies have mapped the rough variations in AGB by combining optical and environmental data at regional and global scales. Nevertheless, these maps cannot represent local variations in AGB in tropical forests. In this paper, we hypothesize that the problem of misrepresenting local variations in AGB and AGB estimation with good precision occurs because of both methodological limits (signal saturation or dilution bias) and a lack of adequate calibration data in this range of AGB values. We test this hypothesis by developing a calibrated regression model to predict variations in high AGB values (mean \textgreater{}300 Mg/ha) in French Guiana by a methodological approach for spatial extrapolation with data from the optical geoscience laser altimeter system (GLAS), forest inventories, radar, optics, and environmental variables for spatial inter-and extrapolation. Given their higher point count, GLAS data allow a wider coverage of AGB values. We find that the metrics from GLAS footprints are correlated with field AGB estimations (R 2 =0.54, RMSE=48.3 Mg/ha) with no bias for high values. First, predictive models, including remote-sensing, environmental variables and spatial correlation functions, allow us to obtain ""wall-to-wall"" AGB maps over French Guiana with an RMSE for the in situ AGB estimates of ~51 Mg/ha and R${}^2$=0.48 at a 1-km grid size. We conclude that a calibrated regression model based on GLAS with dependent environmental data can produce good AGB predictions even for high AGB values if the calibration data fit the AGB range. We also demonstrate that small temporal and spatial mismatches between field data and GLAS footprints are not a problem for regional and global calibrated regression models because field data aim to predict large and deep tendencies in AGB variations from environmental gradients and do not aim to represent high but stochastic and temporally limited variations from forest dynamics. Thus, we advocate including a greater variety of data, even if less precise and shifted, to better represent high AGB values in global models and to improve the fitting of these models for high values.","(450, 13)","This study presents an approach for aboveground biomass (AGB) mapping in French Guiana by integrating remote sensing data with forest inventories and environmental data. The objective of this research is to create accurate and precise carbon stock estimates and biomass maps. We aimed to validate our approach by comparing our AGB estimates with those obtained from previous studies.

We collected forest inventory data from the National Forest Inventory of French Guiana. We used high-resolution optical imagery from WorldView3 satellite and the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to derive canopy height, vegetation indices and environmental variables. We incorporated all these data into a modeling process that allowed for the prediction of AGB at a spatial resolution of 1 ha.

Our results show that the integration of LiDAR data significantly improves the accuracy of AGB estimates. The use of environmental variables such as soil properties, topography, and climate data also played an essential role in improving the accuracy of the estimates. The overall accuracy of our model was 70.5%, and the root mean square error was 55.6 Mg/ha.

We then validated our AGB estimates by comparing our results with those obtained from two previous studies. Our estimates were consistent with the results of the previous studies, with a correlation coefficient of 0.6. The results indicate that our approach can provide reliable and repeatable AGB estimates for large areas of forest in French Guiana.

The maps produced in this research can be used to support forest management, carbon stock assessments, and land-use planning activities. The methodology used can be applied to other tropical forests and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of different users.

In conclusion, our study presents an approach for AGB mapping in French Guiana, which combines remote sensing, forest inventories, and environmental data. The integration of LiDAR data and environmental variables significantly improved the accuracy of the estimates. The resulting biomass maps can be a valuable resource for forest management and planning activities.","(359, 17)","Mapping forest aboveground biomass (AGB) has become an important task, particularly for the reporting of  greenhouse gas emissions under the United Nations' Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) program.

This study aimed to develop a robust method for mapping AGB in French Guiana using a combination of remote sensing, forest inventory data, and environmental variables.

We employed a multi-step approach, starting with the collection of forest inventory data from permanent plots established by the French Guiana Forest Inventory. These plots provided ground-truth data on tree species, diameter at breast height, and height, which were used to estimate AGB using allometric equations. Additionally, we used Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to derive spectral indices and vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). We also incorporated environmental variables, including topography, soil type, and climate data, to account for the spatial heterogeneity of the forest ecosystem.

Machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were used to integrate the field data, remote sensing variables, and environmental data to predict AGB at the plot level. The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R-squared). The results showed that the Random Forest model outperformed the SVM model, with an MAE of 12.5 Mg/ha and an R-squared value of 0.85.

The resulting AGB map revealed a high degree of spatial variability, with AGB values ranging from 100 to 400 Mg/ha. The map also highlighted areas of high AGB density, particularly in the northwestern part of the territory, which corresponds to the dense rainforests of the Guiana Shield.

The implications of this study are significant, as the AGB map provides a valuable tool for forest managers, policymakers, and researchers. The map can be used to identify areas of high conservation value, prioritize forest restoration efforts, and monitor changes in forest carbon stocks over time.

Furthermore, the methodology developed in this study can be applied to other tropical regions with similar forest ecosystems, contributing to the development of a global AGB mapping framework.","Mapping forest aboveground biomass (AGB) has become an important task, particularly for the reporting of [National Forest Inventories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Forest_Inventories) (NFI) and [Nationally Determined Contributions](https://www.unfccc.int/nations-climate-contributions/nationally-determined-contribution-nations-covid-19-response/).

We consider the computational problem of finding -- if any -- an invertible transformation on the variables mapping $\mathbf{f}$ to $\mathbf{g}$. The corresponding equivalence problem is known as {\tt Isomorphism of Polynomials with one Secret} ({\tt IP1S}) and is a fundamental problem in multivariate cryptography. The main result is a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for solving {\tt IP1S} for quadratic instances, a particular case of importance in cryptography and somewhat justifying {\it a posteriori} the fact that {\it Graph Isomorphism} reduces to only cubic instances of {\tt IP1S} (Agrawal and Saxena). To this end, we show that {\tt IP1S} for quadratic polynomials can be reduced to a variant of the classical module isomorphism problem in representation theory, which involves to test the orthogonal simultaneous conjugacy of symmetric matrices. We show that we can essentially {\it linearize} the problem by reducing quadratic-{\tt IP1S} to test the orthogonal simultaneous similarity of symmetric matrices; this latter problem was shown by Chistov, Ivanyos and Karpinski to be equivalent to finding an invertible matrix in the linear space $\mathbb{K}^{n \times n}$ of $n \times n$ matrices over $\mathbb{K}$ and to compute the square root in a matrix algebra. While computing square roots of matrices can be done efficiently using numerical methods, it seems difficult to control the bit complexity of such methods. However, we present exact and polynomial-time algorithms for computing the square root in $\mathbb{K}^{n \times n}$ for various fields (including finite fields). We then consider \\#{\tt IP1S}, the counting version of {\tt IP1S} for quadratic instances. In particular, we provide a (complete) characterization of the automorphism group of homogeneous quadratic polynomials. Finally, we also consider the more general {\it Isomorphism of Polynomials} ({\tt IP}) problem where we allow an invertible linear transformation on the variables \emph{and} on the set of polynomials. A randomized polynomial-time algorithm for solving {\tt IP} when \(\mathbf{f}=(x\_1^d,\ldots,x\_n^d)\) is presented. From an algorithmic point of view, the problem boils down to factoring the determinant of a linear matrix (\emph{i.e.}\ a matrix whose components are linear polynomials).

The isomorphism problem on quadratic polynomials is the task of determining whether two given polynomials are equivalent, i.e., whether one can be obtained from the other by a permutation of its variables and a scaling of its coefficients.

First, we present an algorithm that solves the problem for polynomials with rational coefficients by reducing it to the problem of solving Diophantine equations. We then extend this method to work with arbitrary fields. Next, we show how the isomorphism problem on quadratic polynomials can be reduced to the problem of computing roots of univariate polynomials. We provide algorithmic solutions to this problem based on classical algorithms for polynomial root-finding.

We also describe a new algorithm for the isomorphism problem on quadratic polynomials that exploits the connection to the problem of computing Abelian varieties. This algorithm works over arbitrary fields and is based on counting points on the Jacobian varieties of hyperelliptic curves. Finally, we show that under some natural assumptions, the polynomial-time algorithms presented in this paper are optimal.

The techniques developed in this paper have applications in algebraic geometry, cryptography, and computer algebra systems. The results also shed light on the complexity of other important problems in algebra, such as the polynomial identity testing problem and the determination of isomorphism of higher-degree polynomials.

In recent years genetic algorithms have emerged as a useful tool for the heuristic solution ","In recent years genetic algorithms have emerged as a useful tool for the heuristic solution of complex discrete optimisation problems. In particular there has been considerable interest in their use in tackling problems arising in the areas of scheduling and timetabling. However, the classical genetic algorithm paradigm is not well equipped to handle constraints and successful implementations usually require some sort of modification to enable the search to exploit problem specific knowledge in order to overcome this shortcoming.

This paper is concerned with the development of a family of genetic algorithms for the solution of a nurse rostering problem at a major UK hospital. The hospital is made up of wards of up to 30 nurses. Each ward has its own group of nurses whose shifts have to be scheduled on a weekly basis. In addition to fulfilling the minimum demand for staff over three daily shifts, nurses' wishes and qualifications have to be taken into account. The schedules must also be seen to be fair, in that unpopular shifts have to be spread evenly amongst all nurses, and other restrictions, such as team nursing and special conditions for senior staff, have to be satisfied. The basis of the family of genetic algorithms is a classical genetic algorithm consisting of n-point crossover, single-bit mutation and a rank-based selection. The solution space consists of all schedules in which each nurse works the required number of shifts, but the remaining constraints, both hard and soft, are relaxed and penalised in the fitness function. The talk will start with a detailed description of the problem and the initial implementation and will go on to highlight the shortcomings of such an approach, in terms of the key element of balancing feasibility, i.e. covering the demand and work regulations, and quality, as measured by the nurses' preferences. A series of experiments involving parameter adaptation, niching, intelligent weights, delta coding, local hill climbing, migration and special selection rules will then be outlined and it will be shown how a series of these enhancements were able to eradicate these difficulties. Results based on several months' real data will be used to measure the impact of each modification, and to show that the final algorithm is able to compete with a tabu search approach currently employed at the hospital. The talk will conclude with some observations as to the overall quality of this approach to this and similar problems.","(439, 15)","Nurse rostering, the process of assigning work schedules to nurses, is a well-known problem in healthcare institutions, where it has a critical impact on operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. Given the large number of constraints and the complexity of the problem, the use of optimization techniques has become a necessity. Among these techniques, genetic algorithms (GAs) have shown great promise and have been widely used in nurse rostering problems. 

This study presents a novel approach to nurse rostering that utilizes GAs to solve the problem of scheduling nurses for different shifts while satisfying various constraints such as preference requests, required skills, workload balance, and labor regulations. The proposed framework consists of three main phases, namely encoding, fitness function evaluation, and evolution.

In the encoding phase, a chromosome is generated for each nurse including several genes which represent the preferred shift type, skill level, and the number of working days. The fitness function evaluation phase computes the corresponding fitness value for each chromosome based on the given constraints. In the evolution phase, various genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation are applied to generate better chromosomes. The final solution is obtained by applying the optimal chromosome as the schedule for each nurse.

To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a set of experiments was conducted on four real-world nurse rostering datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating high-quality schedules within practical time limits. The proposed GA-based method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both computational time and solution quality, with an improvement of up to 12%. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was performed to measure the robustness of the proposed algorithm to variations in input parameters.

In conclusion, nurse rostering is a complex problem in healthcare institutions that can effectively be addressed using genetic algorithms. This paper presents a novel approach to nurse rostering that utilizes GAs to solve the problem of scheduling nurses while satisfying multiple constraints. The proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality and computational time.","(379, 16)","In recent years genetic algorithms have emerged as a useful tool for the heuristic solution  of complex combinatorial optimization problems such as nurse rostering.

Purpose. It has been reported clinically that rupture or dissections in thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) ","Purpose. It has been reported clinically that rupture or dissections in thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) often occur due to hypertension which may be modelled with sudden increase of peripheral resistance, inducing acute changes of blood volumes in the aorta. There is clinical evidence that more compliant aneurysms are less prone to rupture as they can sustain such changes of volume.

The aim of the current paper is to verify this paradigm by evaluating computationally the role played by the variation of peripheral resistance and the impact of aortic stiffness onto peak wall stress in ascending TAA. Methods.

Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analyses were performed using patient-specific geometries and boundary conditions derived from 4D MRI datasets acquired on a patient. Blood was assumed incompressible and was treated as a non-Newtonian fluid using the Carreau model while the wall mechanical properties were obtained from the bulge inflation tests carried out in vitro after surgical repair. The Navier Stokes equations were solved in ANSYS Fluent. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation was used to account for the wall deformations. At the interface between the solid domain and the fluid domain, the fluid pressure was transferred to the wall and the displacement of the wall was transferred to the fluid. The two systems were connected by the System Coupling component which controls the solver execution of fluid and solid simulations in ANSYS. Fluid and solid domains were solved sequentially starting from the fluid simulations. Results. Distributions of blood flow, wall shear stress and wall stress were evaluated in the ascending thoracic aorta using the FSI analyses. We always observed a significant flow eccentricity in the simulations, in very good agreement with velocity profiles measured using 4D MRI. The results also showed significant increase of peak wall stress due to the increase of peripheral resistance and aortic stiffness.

In the worst case scenario, the largest peripheral resistance (10 10 kg.s.m-4) and stiffness (10 MPa) resulted in a maximal principal stress equal to 702 kPa, whereas it was only 77 kPa in normal conditions. Conclusions. This is the first time that the risk of rupture of an aTAA is quantified in case of the combined effects of hypertension and aortic stiffness increase. Our findings suggest that a stiffer TAA may have the most altered distribution of wall stress and an acute change of peripheral vascular resistance could significantly increase the risk of rupture for a stiffer aneurysm.","(433, 20)","The accurate evaluation of mechanical stresses within the walls of an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm is crucial for the prediction of aneurysmal growth and the risk of dissection. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the peak wall stress within an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm using Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations, and assess the impact of vascular stiffness and peripheral resistance on maximum wall stress.

Our computational model was based on a CT scan of a patient with aortic aneurysm. Using Finite Element Analysis, an FSI simulation was carried out to model the interaction between fluid and solid structures. To determine the effects of vascular stiffness and resistance on wall stress, several simulations with varying levels of stiffness and resistance were performed.

Our findings indicated that peak wall stress in the ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm was influenced by both aortic stiffness and peripheral resistance. As aortic stiffness increased, maximum wall stress increased accordingly, regardless of peripheral resistance. However, when peripheral resistance was increased, wall stress decreased due to reduced blood flow and pressure within the aneurysm.

Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering both aortic stiffness and peripheral resistance in the evaluation of peak wall stress within ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms. Our findings have implications in the development of patient-specific numerical simulations for clinical decision-making and in the design of more accurate predictive models for aneurysmal growth and rupture.","(250, 10)","Purpose. It has been reported clinically that rupture or dissections in thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA)  often occur when the peak wall stress (PWS) exceeds a certain threshold. However, the effects of aortic stiffness and peripheral resistance on PWS in TAA are not well understood. This study aims to investigate the impact of aortic stiffening and peripheral resistance changes on PWS in an ascending TAA using fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations.

Methodology. A computational model of an ascending TAA was developed using the finite element method (FEM). The aortic wall was modeled as a nonlinear, anisotropic, and incompressible material, while the blood flow was simulated using the Navier-Stokes equations. The FSI simulations were performed using the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method to account for the large deformations of the aortic wall. The simulations were conducted under various conditions of aortic stiffness (ranging from normal to severely stiffened) and peripheral resistance (ranging from low to high). The PWS was calculated using the von Mises stress criterion.

Findings. The results showed that increasing aortic stiffness led to a significant increase in PWS in the ascending TAA, particularly in the regions adjacent to the aneurysm. In contrast, decreasing peripheral resistance resulted in a decrease in PWS. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that the PWS was highly sensitive to changes in aortic stiffness, with a 10% increase in stiffness resulting in a 25% increase in PWS. Conversely, a 10% decrease in peripheral resistance led to a 15% decrease in PWS.

Implications. The findings of this study suggest that aortic stiffening plays a critical role in the development of high PWS in ascending TAA, which may contribute to the risk of rupture or dissection.

Additionally, the results of this study may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing aortic stiffness and mitigating the risk of TAA rupture or dissection.

Conclusion. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the critical role of aortic stiffness in determining peak wall stress in ascending TAA using FSI simulations.

Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) methods are useful tools to rank input parameters uncertainties regarding their ","Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) methods are useful tools to rank input parameters uncertainties regarding their impact on result variability. In practice, such type of approach is still at an exploratory level for studies relying on 2D Shallow Water Equations (SWE) codes as GSA requires specific tools and deals with important computational capacity. The aim of this paper is to provide both a protocol and a tool to carry out a GSA for 2D hydraulic modelling applications. A coupled tool between Prom{\'e}th{\'e}e (a parametric computation environment) and FullSWOF 2D (a code relying on 2D SWE) has been set up: Prom{\'e}th{\'e}e-FullSWOF 2D (P-FS). The main steps of our protocol are: i) to identify the 2D hydraulic code input parameters of interest and to assign them a probability density function, ii) to propagate uncertainties within the model, and iii) to rank the effects of each input parameter on the output of interest. For our study case, simulations of a river flood event were run with uncertainties introduced through three parameters using P-FS tool.

Tests were performed on regular computational mesh, spatially discretizing an urban area, using up to 17.9 million of computational points. P-FS tool has been installed on a cluster for computation. Method and P-FS tool successfully allow the computation of Sobol indices maps.

The complexity of such models often leads to a very high number of parameters, with consequent difficulty in assessing their influence on the output. GSA allows for a prioritization of these parameters in terms of sensitivity, providing a more efficient way to allocate resources for calibration and to estimate confidence intervals for predictions. 

In this paper, we propose a standardized protocol for GSA with 2D hydraulic codes, incorporating the best practices from the literature and our own experience. The protocol uses the Sobol' method for variance-based sensitivity analysis, which is particularly suitable for models with strong interactions between parameters. By applying our method to a synthetic test case, we demonstrate its robustness and efficiency, as well as its ability to reveal underlying physical mechanisms.

To facilitate the implementation of the proposed protocol, we have developed a practical tool, named GSA-HYD, which dynamically links Sobol' indices to different stages of the hydraulic model workflow. GSA-HYD reduces the need for manual intervention and specialized programming skills, enabling a wider range of users to benefit from GSA. We illustrate the use of GSA-HYD with a real-world application, a flood simulation of a river reach in Australia. The results show that by including GSA in the model development and calibration process, we can greatly improve the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

Finally, we address some of the limitations and challenges of the proposed protocol and tool, such as the need for expert judgment in identifying the input parameter ranges and the computationally intensive nature of the Sobol' method. We also discuss some of the potential future developments in the field, such as the integration of GSA with optimization algorithms and the exploration of alternative sensitivity measures.

In conclusion, this paper presents a comprehensive framework for GSA with 2D hydraulic codes, which includes a standardized protocol and a practical tool. By combining theoretical and practical aspects, we aim to facilitate the adoption of GSA by the hydraulic modelling community and to contribute to the improvement of flood risk assessments and management.","(389, 14)","Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) methods are useful tools to rank input parameters uncertainties regarding their  impact on model outputs. In the context of 2D hydraulic codes, which are widely used for flood risk assessment and water resources management, GSA can help to identify the most influential parameters affecting the simulation results. However, the application of GSA to 2D hydraulic models is not straightforward due to the complexity of these models and the large number of input parameters involved.

This paper presents an applied protocol for performing GSA on 2D hydraulic code outputs. The protocol is based on the Sobol' method, which is one of the most widely used GSA techniques. The proposed protocol consists of four main steps: (1) model calibration, (2) input parameter selection, (3) GSA computation, and (4) results interpretation. In the first step, the 2D hydraulic model is calibrated using a set of observed data. In the second step, a subset of input parameters is selected based on their potential impact on the model outputs. The third step involves the computation of the Sobol' indices, which quantify the contribution of each input parameter to the variance of the model output. Finally, the results are interpreted to identify the most sensitive input parameters.

The proposed protocol is applied to a real-world case study involving a flood-prone area in a developing country. The results show that the proposed protocol is effective in identifying the most influential input parameters affecting the model outputs. Specifically, it is found that the Manning's roughness coefficient and the channel slope are the most sensitive parameters. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of flood risk management and water resources planning. The proposed protocol is also compared with other GSA methods, and its advantages and limitations are highlighted. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of GSA in 2D hydraulic modeling and providing recommendations for future research directions. Overall, this paper contributes to the development of a practical tool for GSA in the field of hydraulic engineering, which can be used by researchers and practitioners to improve the accuracy and reliability of flood risk assessments and water resources management decisions. ### | End of Response | ### ### | Instruction | ###

In a recent paper [2], we have shown that the Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonian does not derived from the minimal-coupling hamiltonian with the help of a gauge transformation. This result has been challenged by G.

K{\'o}nya, al. in a comment 1 where the authors claim the equivalence between the Power-Zienau-Woolley hamiltonian and the minimal-coupling hamiltonian in the Poincar{\'e} gauge. They claim that we have made one error and one wrong emphasis in our paper: The error as summarized by G. K{\'o}nya al. would be: ""The canonical field momentum is not gauge invariant. Equivalent transformations of the Lagrangian do change the momentum. In field theories, gauge transformations are special cases of such transformations. The electric field E is gauge invariant, but its capacity of being the canonical momentum is not. "" The wrong emphasis as summarized by G.K{\'o}nya al. would be: ""The use of the canonical coordinate/momentum pair A p and E in Poincar{\'e} gauge is presented as mandatory in Rousseau and Felbacq paper, whereas as there is a certain freedom of choice in selecting this pair. Also in Poincar{\'e} gauge it is possible to use A c as canonical coordinate, in which case the conjugate momentum will be D. This is the most convenient choice in terms of the set of nontrivial Dirac brackets. Cf. Table 1 in G. K{\'o}nya al. paper 1 for possible choices."" We do not share these conclusions and show in this reply that these statements are incorrect. Specifically, we show that under a gauge transformation, the canonical momentum $\pi$(x,t) conjugated to the vector potential A(x,t) is given by $\pi$(x,t) = --$\epsilon$\_0 E(x,t). This happens because the Lagrangian does not contains terms proportional to $\partial$\_t $\phi$ (x,t) where $\phi$ (x,t) is the scalar potential. Moreover our choice of canonical variables was challenged. Actually, our set of independent variables is exactly the same as in G. K{\'o}nya al. except that we do not write explicitly the dependent variables in term of the independent ones. This is one great advantage of the Dirac procedure for constrained hamiltonian.","(507, 22)","This paper presents a reply to the article by G. Kónya et al. entitled ""The equivalence of the Power-Zineau-Woolley picture and the Poincaré gauge from the very first principles"". The authors raise questions regarding the validity of the results and interpretations presented in the aforementioned article, and provide their own analysis to shed light on relevant issues.

Firstly, the authors carefully examine the assumptions made in Kónya et al.'s work and show that some of these assumptions are not fully consistent with the principles underlying the Power-Zineau-Woolley picture. Specifically, they demonstrate that the use of a non-zero vierbein torsion is not compatible with the standard definition of this picture. They further argue that the conclusions presented in Kónya et al.'s article might be sensitive to these discrepancies and that a more consistent treatment is required to establish the equivalence between the two frameworks.

Furthermore, the authors suggest alternative interpretations of some of the results presented by Kónya et al., which demonstrate that the equivalence between the Power-Zineau-Woolley picture and the Poincaré gauge is not as straightforward as it may seem. Specifically, they show that the term responsible for the equivalence found in Kónya et al.'s work is not independent of the choice of gauge, and thus the equivalence is not a general statement applicable to all gauges.

Finally, the authors provide a more general discussion of the theoretical frameworks used in their and Kónya et al.'s work. They argue that the Power-Zineau-Woolley picture is a natural extension of the standard Poincaré gauge theory, and that the equivalence demonstrated by Kónya et al. might be a particular case of a more general equivalence between different gauge theories. They suggest some lines of inquiry that could be explored in future work to clarify these issues.

Gas behavior in systems at microscale has been receiving significant attention from researchers in the ","Gas behavior in systems at microscale has been receiving significant attention from researchers in the last two decades [1-4]. Today, there is an enhanced emphasis on developing new experimental techniques to capture the local temperature profiles in gases at rarefied conditions. The main underlying reason behind this focus is the interesting physics exhibited by gases at these rarefied conditions, especially in the transition regime. There is the onset of local thermodynamic disequilibrium, which manifests as velocity slip and temperature jump [1-4] at the wall. However, there is limited experimental evidence on understanding these aforementioned phenomena. With the advances in experimental facilities, it is today possible, at least in principle, to map the local temperature profiles in gases at rarefied conditions. Molecular tagging approach is one such technique which has shown the potential to map the temperature profile in low pressure conditions [5]. In molecular tagging approach, a very small percentage of tracer molecules are introduced into the gas of interest, referred as carrier gas. In gas flow studies, the typical tracers employed are acetone and biacetyl. These tracer molecules, assumed to be in equilibrium with the carrier gas, are excited with a source of energy at a specific wavelength, typically a laser. The excited molecules are unstable and tend to de-excite in a radiative and non-radiative manner, which is manifested as fluorescence and phosphorescence. Following the deformation with time of a tagged line permits to obtain the flow velocity. In addition, the dependence of the phosphorescence and fluorescence intensity to the gas temperature could also allow to use this technique for local temperature measurements. The objective of this study is to develop an experimental setup capable of simultaneously mapping the wall and fluid near-wall temperatures with the final goal to measure temperature jump at the wall when rarefied conditions are reached. The originality of this setup shown in Figure 1 is to couple surface temperature measurements using an infrared camera with Molecular Tagging Thermometry (MTT) for gas temperature measurements. The bottom wall of the channel will be made of Sapphire substrate of 650 $\mu$m thickness coated with a thin film of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). The average roughness of this ITO layer is about 3 nm. The top wall of the channel will be made of SU8 and bonded with the bottom wall with a layer of PDMS. The channel will be filled in with acetone vapor,","(444, 19)","This paper presents a proposed design for simultaneously measuring wall and near-wall temperatures in gas microflows. The ability to measure both temperatures is critical in understanding the fundamental behaviors of gas flows at microscales and in developing more efficient and accurate microscale devices.

The proposed design involves the use of microscale thermocouples integrated onto thin-film membranes. The thin-film membranes are made of silicon nitride, which has excellent thermal and mechanical properties, and are bonded onto the walls of microchannels. The thermocouples are then deposited onto the membranes using microfabrication techniques.

To validate the proposed design, simulations were carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The results show that the proposed design is capable of measuring both wall and near-wall temperatures with high accuracy and resolution. The simulations also demonstrate the importance of having both temperature measurements, as the near-wall temperature can deviate significantly from the bulk temperature in gas microflows.

The proposed design has several advantages compared to existing methods. First, it provides simultaneous measurements of both wall and near-wall temperatures, which is not possible with most existing techniques. Second, the thin-film membranes are highly sensitive and can detect small temperature changes, making the design suitable for a wide range of applications. Finally, the microfabrication techniques used to manufacture the design are well-established, making it easy to replicate and adapt to different microscale devices.

Gauss-Bonnet for simple graphs G assures that the sum of curvatures K(x) over the vertex ","Gauss-Bonnet for simple graphs G assures that the sum of curvatures K(x) over the vertex set V of G is the Euler characteristic X(G). Poincare-Hopf tells that for any injective function f on V the sum of i(f,x) is X(G). We also know that averaging the indices E[i(f,x)] over all functions gives curvature K(x).

We explore here the situation when G is geometric of dimension d: that is if each unit sphere S(x) is geometric of dimension d-1 and that X(S(x))=0 for even d and X(S(x))=2 for odd d. The dimension of G is inductively defined as the average of 1+dim(S(x)) over all S(x) assuming the empty graph has dimension -1.

We prove that any odd dimensional geometric graph G has zero curvature. This is done with the help of an index formula j(f,x) = 1-X(S(x))/2-X(B(f,x))/2, where j(x)=[i(f,x)+i(-f,x)]/2. The graph B(f,x) is the discrete level surface {y | f(y) = f(x)} intersected with S(x). It is a subgraph of the line graph of G and geometric if G is geometric.

The index formula simplifies for geometric graphs: for even d it is j(f,x) = 1-X(B(f,x))/2, where B(f,x) is a (d-2)-dimensional graph. For odd d it becomes j(f,x) =-X(B(f,x))/2, where B(f,x) is an odd dimensional graph. Because by induction with respect to d, the X(B(f,x))=0 we know now that that j(f,x) is zero for all x and so, by taking expectation over f that curvature K(x) is zero for all x.

We also point out that all these results hold almost verbatim for compact Riemannian manifolds and actually are much simpler there. The same integral geometric index formula is valid if f is a Morse function, i(f,x) is the index of the gradient vector field and if S(x) is a sufficiently small geodesic sphere around x and B(f,x) which is S(x) intersected with the level surface {y | f(y)=f(x)}. Also in the continuum, the symmetric index j(f,x) is constant zero everywhere if d is odd.","(542, 14)","In this paper, we present an index formula for simple graphs that provides a simple way of describing the topological structure of a graph. The index formula we propose is a combinatorial algorithm that captures essential structural information of a graph, such as its degree sequence and connectivity, and yields a unique index number. The index can be used in various applications related to graph theory, such as graph enumeration, graph similarity analysis, and graph classification.

The index formula involves a recursive algorithm that partitions the graph into smaller subgraphs and uses their indices to calculate the index of the original graph. We prove that our index formula satisfies a number of desirable properties, including invariance under graph isomorphism, monotonicity under vertex deletion, and subadditivity under graph fusion. We also show that some well-known graph parameters, such as the diameter, the chromatic number, and the Tutte polynomial, can be expressed in terms of the index formula.

To illustrate the utility of our index formula, we provide several examples of its application in graph theory. We demonstrate how the index can be used to classify graphs into categories based on their structural similarity, and to efficiently enumerate the number of graphs satisfying certain structural constraints. Furthermore, we show how the index can be used to compare the structural similarity between brain networks of different individuals, and to identify abnormal brain networks in patients with neurological disorders.

In conclusion, we present a novel index formula for simple graphs that provides a powerful and versatile tool for analyzing the structural properties of graphs. Our index formula offers several advantages over existing graph parameters and can be applied in a wide range of fields, including computer science, network science, and neuroscience. We believe that our index formula will be a valuable contribution to the field of graph theory and will stimulate further research on graph indices and their applications.","(348, 12)","Gauss-Bonnet for simple graphs G assures that the sum of curvatures K(x) over the vertex 1 ≤ x ≤ n is equal to 2πχ(G), where χ(G) is the Euler characteristic of the graph G.

In this paper, we derive an index formula for simple undirected graphs, which allows us to compute the Euler characteristic χ(G) directly from the adjacency matrix A of the graph G.

Our research question is: Can we find a more efficient way to calculate the Euler characteristic of a simple undirected graph G, given its adjacency matrix A? To address this question, we employ a combination of algebraic and combinatorial techniques. Specifically, we use the properties of the adjacency matrix A to derive a closed-form expression for the index of the graph G, denoted by I(G). The index I(G) is a topological invariant that encodes information about the graph G, including its Euler characteristic χ(G).

ABRIDGED We present measurements of the Type Ia supernova (SN) rate in galaxy clusters based ","ABRIDGED We present measurements of the Type Ia supernova (SN) rate in galaxy clusters based on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey. The cluster SN Ia rate is determined from 9 SN events in a set of 71 C4 clusters at z <0.17 and 27 SN events in 492 maxBCG clusters at 0.1 < z < 0.3$.

We find values for the cluster SN Ia rate of $({0.37}^{+0.17+0.01}_{-0.12-0.01}) \mathrm{SNu}r h^{2}$ and $({0.55}^{+0.13+0.02}_{-0.11-0.01}) \mathrm{SNu}r h^{2}$ ($\mathrm{SNu}x = 10^{-12} L_{x\sun}^{-1} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) in C4 and maxBCG clusters, respectively, where the quoted errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. The SN rate for early-type galaxies is found to be $({0.31}^{+0.18+0.01}_{-0.12-0.01}) \mathrm{SNu}r h^{2}$ and $({0.49}^{+0.15+0.02}_{-0.11-0.01})$ $\mathrm{SNu}r h^{2}$ in C4 and maxBCG clusters, respectively. The SN rate for the brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) is found to be $({2.04}^{+1.99+0.07}_{-1.11-0.04}) \mathrm{SNu}r h^{2}$ and $({0.36}^{+0.84+0.01}_{-0.30-0.01}) \mathrm{SNu}r h^{2}$ in C4 and maxBCG clusters. The ratio of the SN Ia rate in cluster early-type galaxies to that of the SN Ia rate in field early-type galaxies is ${1.94}^{+1.31+0.043}_{-0.91-0.015}$ and ${3.02}^{+1.31+0.062}_{-1.03-0.048}$, for C4 and maxBCG clusters. The SN rate in galaxy clusters as a function of redshift...shows only weak dependence on redshift. Combining our current measurements with previous measurements, we fit the cluster SN Ia rate data to a linear function of redshift, and find $r_{L} = $ $[(0.49^{+0.15}_{-0.14}) +$ $(0.91^{+0.85}_{-0.81}) \times z]$ $\mathrm{SNu}B$ $h^{2}$. A comparison of the radial distribution of SNe in cluster to field early-type galaxies shows possible evidence for an enhancement of the SN rate in the cores of cluster early-type galaxies... we estimate the fraction of cluster SNe that are hostless to be $(9.4^+8._3-5.1)%$.","(518, 9)","This study presents a measurement of the rate of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in galaxy clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey, which offers a unique opportunity to study supernovae in a cluster environment. This paper utilizes data from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey's first two seasons, during which it obtained multi-epoch imaging for 279 optical and infrared supernova fields. Twenty-seven of these fields overlap with galaxy clusters, enabling a comprehensive study of the SN Ia rate in cluster environments.

The authors measure the volumetric SN Ia rate within a redshift range of 0.05 < z < 0.35 for a total of 55 galaxy clusters. They use a photometric classification algorithm, which is optimized for the SDSS-II Supernova Survey data, to identify SNe Ia and determine the completeness of the sample. Additionally, they correct for various observational biases, including host galaxy extinction and detection efficiency, to derive the final volumetric rate.

The resulting SN Ia rate in galaxy clusters is found to be (0.36 ± 0.08) × 10⁻⁴ h³₇₀ Mpc⁻³ yr⁻¹ (statistical uncertainty only), where h₇₀ is the present value of the Hubble constant in units of 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹. This rate is consistent with previous measurements in the field and does not show any significant evolution with redshift. However, from the combination of this study with previous work, the authors note a possible trend of increasing SN Ia rate with cluster mass.

The authors present several implications of their findings, including the suggestion that SNe Ia in galaxy clusters are part of the general SN Ia population and that the environment does not significantly affect their rate or properties. They also discuss possible improvements for future studies, such as increasing the sample size and including other cluster properties in the analysis.

In summary, this study provides a measurement of the SN Ia rate in galaxy clusters from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey.

For a simplicial complex with n sets, let W^-(x) be the set of sets in ","For a simplicial complex with n sets, let W^-(x) be the set of sets in G contained in x and W^+(x) the set of sets in G containing x. An integer-valued function h on G defines for every A subset G an energy E[A]=sum_x in A h(x).

The function energizes the geometry similarly as divisors do in the continuum, where the Riemann-Roch quantity chi(G)+deg(D) plays the role of the energy.

Define the n times n matrices L=L^--(x,y)=E[W^-(x) cap W^-(y)] and L^++(x,y) = E[W^+(x) cap W^+(y)]. With the notation S(x,y)=1_n omega(x) =delta(x,y) (-1)dim(x) and str(A)=tr(SA) define g=S L^++ S. The results are: det(L)=det(g) = prod_x in G h(x) and E[G] = sum_x,y g(x,y) and E[G]=str(g). The number of positive eigenvalues of g is equal to the number of positive energy values of h. In special cases, more is true: A) If h(x) in -1, 1}, the matrices L=L^--,L^++ are unimodular and L^-1 = g, even if G is a set of sets. B) In the constant energy h(x)=1 case, L and g are isospectral, positive definite matrices in SL(n,Z). For any set of sets G we get so isospectral multi-graphs defined by adjacency matrices L^++ or L^-- which have identical spectral or Ihara zeta function. The positive definiteness holds for positive divisors in general. C) In the topological case h(x)=omega(x), the energy E[G]=str(L) = str(g) = sum_x,y g(x,y)=chi(G) is the Euler characteristic of G and phi(G)=prod_x omega(x), a product identity which holds for arbitrary set of sets. D) For h(x)=t^|x| with some parameter t we have E[H]=1-f_H(t) with f_H(t)=1+f_0 t + cdots + f_d t^d+1 for the f-vector of H and L(x,y) = (1-f_W^-(x) cap W^-(y)(t)) and g(x,y)=omega(x) omega(y) (1-f_W^+(x) cap W^+(y)(t)). Now, the inverse of g is g^-1(x,y) = 1-f_W^-(x) cap W^-(y)(t)/t^dim(x cap y) and E[G] = 1-f_G(t)=sum_x,y g(x,y).","(570, 12)","Energized simplicial complexes are an innovative approach to modeling energy systems in physical, biological, and social contexts. This framework is based on the mathematical concept of a simplicial complex, which represents the structure of a system as a network of interconnected nodes and simplices. The energized modification of this approach allows for the incorporation of energy flows and storage into the topology, resulting in a more accurate and realistic representation of complex energy systems.

In this paper, we explore the theoretical foundations and practical applications of energized simplicial complexes. We begin by describing the formal definition of a simplicial complex and how it can be used to represent various types of systems. We then introduce the concept of energization, which is based on the idea of attaching energy weights to the nodes and simplices, thereby capturing the energy flows and storage within the system.

We show how energized simplicial complexes can be used to model a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems. For example, we demonstrate how this approach can be applied to electrical grids, where nodes represent power generators and simplices represent transmission lines. By including energy weights, we can capture the flow of electricity through the grid and assess its robustness and vulnerability to disruptions.

Similarly, we show how energized simplicial complexes can be used to model ecological systems, where nodes represent species and simplices represent ecological interactions. By including energy weights, we can capture the flow of energy through the food web and predict the effects of environmental disturbances on the ecosystem.

Finally, we discuss some of the challenges and opportunities associated with energized simplicial complexes. This includes issues related to data collection and analysis, as well as opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of new computational tools.

Overall, energized simplicial complexes represent a promising approach to modeling complex energy systems. By incorporating energy flows and storage into the topology of a simplicial complex, we can gain new insights into the dynamics and resilience of these systems. This approach has broad applications across a range of fields and may lead to practical solutions for managing and optimizing energy systems.","(390, 16)","For a simplicial complex with n sets, let W^-(x) be the set of sets in 0, 1, 2,..., n-1 dimensions that are subsets of x, and let W^+(x) be the union of all sets in W^-(x).

We investigate the properties of energized simplical complexes and their applications in various fields.

Our research question is: What are the properties and applications of energized simplicical complexes? To answer this question, we use a combination of theoretical and computational methods. First, we develop a theoretical framework for energized simplicials, which includes a set of axioms that define the properties of E. We then use these axioms to derive several key results, including a characterization of when an energized simplical complex is connected and a formula for computing the energy of a simplical complex.

In computer science, our work can be used to develop more efficient algorithms for clustering and dimensionality reduction.

(l) I have enough evidence to render the sentence S probable. (la) So, relative to ","(l) I have enough evidence to render the sentence S probable. (la) So, relative to what I know, it is rational of me to believe S. (2) Now that I have more evidence, S may no longer be probable. (2a) So now, relative to what I know, it is not rational of me to believe S. These seem a perfectly ordinary, common sense, pair of situations. Generally and vaguely, I take them to embody what I shall call probabilistic inference. This form of inference is clearly non-monotonic. Relatively few people have taken this form of inference, based on high probability, to serve as a foundation for non-monotonic logic or for a logical or defeasible inference. There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks that sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning.

Judea Pearl [ 17] has recently been exploring the possibility. There are any number of people whom one might call probability enthusiasts who feel that probability provides all the answers by itself, with no need of help from logic. Cheeseman [1], Henrion [5] and others think it useful to look at a distribution of probabilities over a whole algebra of statements, to update that distribution in the light of new evidence, and to use the latest updated distribution of probability over the algebra as a basis for planning and decision making. A slightly weaker form of this approach is captured by Nilsson [15], where one assumes certain probabilities for certain statements, and infers the probabilities, or constraints on the probabilities of other statement. None of this corresponds to what I call probabilistic inference. All of the inference that is taking place, either in Bayesian updating, or in probabilistic logic, is strictly deductive. Deductive inference, particularly that concerned with the distribution of classical probabilities or chances, is of great importance. But this is not to say that there is no important role for what earlier logicians have called ""ampliative"" or ""inductive"" or ""scientific"" inference, in which the conclusion goes beyond the premises, asserts more than do the premises. This depends on what David Israel [6] has called ""real rules of inference"". It is characteristic of any such logic or inference procedure that it can go wrong: that statements accepted at one point may be rejected at a later point. Research underlying the results reported here has been partially supported by the Signals Warfare Center of the United States Army.","(471, 18)","Probabilistic and non-monotonic inference are two key areas of study within the field of artificial intelligence and logic. Probabilistic inference involves the use of probability theory to make inferences about uncertain or ambiguous data. Non-monotonic inference, on the other hand, involves reasoning in the face of incomplete or inconsistent information.

The field of probabilistic inference has grown in recent years due to the increasing availability of large, complex datasets and the need to make accurate predictions in a range of domains. This has led to the development of a wide range of probabilistic models, including Bayesian networks, hidden Markov models, and Gaussian processes. These models allow for the integration of multiple sources of data and the quantification of uncertainty in predictive models.

While probabilistic inference has been successful in a range of applications, it has limitations when it comes to reasoning with incomplete or inconsistent data. This is where non-monotonic inference comes in. Non-monotonic reasoning allows for the revision of assumptions and the accommodation of new information as it becomes available. It is thus well-suited to applications where incomplete or conflicting data is likely to be encountered.

One key challenge in non-monotonic inference is the handling of exceptions. Unlike traditional logic, which assumes a closed world with no unknown facts, non-monotonic inference deals with an open world where new information may invalidate previous assumptions. This requires the development of specialized reasoning techniques, such as default logic and circumscription.

Despite the differences between probabilistic and non-monotonic inference, there are areas of overlap and synergy between the two. For example, probabilistic models can be used to help resolve inconsistencies or uncertainties in non-monotonic reasoning, while non-monotonic reasoning can be used to handle exceptions in probabilistic models.

In conclusion, both probabilistic and non-monotonic inference are important areas of study within artificial intelligence and logic. They offer complementary approaches to reasoning with uncertain or incomplete information, and have important applications in domains ranging from natural language processing to robotics. Ongoing research in these areas promises to yield new insights into the nature of reasoning and to enable the development of more powerful and flexible intelligent systems.","(385, 18)","(l) I have enough evidence to render the sentence S probable.

This paper deals with the computation of second or higher order greeks of financial securities. ","This paper deals with the computation of second or higher order greeks of financial securities. It combines two methods, Vibrato and automatic differentiation and compares with other methods. We show that this combined technique is faster than standard finite difference, more stable than automatic differentiation of second order derivatives and more general than Malliavin Calculus. We present a generic framework to compute any greeks and present several applications on different types of financial contracts: European and American options, multidimensional Basket Call and stochastic volatility models such as Heston's model. We give also an algorithm to compute derivatives for the Longstaff-Schwartz Monte Carlo method for American options. We also extend automatic differentiation for second order derivatives of options with non-twice differentiable payoff. 1. Introduction. Due to BASEL III regulations, banks are requested to evaluate the sensitivities of their portfolios every day (risk assessment). Some of these portfolios are huge and sensitivities are time consuming to compute accurately. Faced with the problem of building a software for this task and distrusting automatic differentiation for non-differentiable functions, we turned to an idea developed by Mike Giles called Vibrato. Vibrato at core is a differentiation of a combination of likelihood ratio method and pathwise evaluation. In Giles [12], [13], it is shown that the computing time, stability and precision are enhanced compared with numerical differentiation of the full Monte Carlo path. In many cases, double sensitivities, i.e. second derivatives with respect to parameters, are needed (e.g. gamma hedging). Finite difference approximation of sensitivities is a very simple method but its precision is hard to control because it relies on the appropriate choice of the increment. Automatic differentiation of computer programs bypass the difficulty and its computing cost is similar to finite difference, if not cheaper. But in finance the payoff is never twice differentiable and so generalized derivatives have to be used requiring approximations of Dirac functions of which the precision is also doubtful. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of Vibrato for second and higher derivatives. We will first compare Vibrato applied twice with the analytic differentiation of Vibrato and show that it is equivalent, as the second is easier we propose the best compromise for second derivatives: Automatic Differentiation of Vibrato. In [8], Capriotti has recently investigated the coupling of different mathematical methods -- namely pathwise and likelihood ratio methods -- with an Automatic differ","(445, 22)","This paper presents a novel approach to computing high order derivatives and sensitivities of financial options using vibrato and automatic differentiation. The vibrato technique introduces perturbations into Monte Carlo simulation paths to estimate high order derivatives, while automatic differentiation provides an efficient and accurate method for computing the corresponding sensitivities.

Our methodology is compared with standard methods used in finance, including finite differences and adjoint algorithmic differentiation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that vibrato and automatic differentiation lead to significantly more accurate and efficient computations of high order derivatives and sensitivities, providing an important tool for option traders, portfolio managers, and risk analysts.

To illustrate the applicability of our approach, we consider several examples of real-world financial options, including European call options, Asian options, and barrier options. We investigate the performance of different algorithms and show that vibrato and automatic differentiation can be used to accurately price options with complex payoff functions and time-varying parameters.

Moreover, the proposed methodology can be extended to other problems in finance and applied mathematics that require the computation of high order derivatives and sensitivities. Examples include the calibration of financial models, optimal portfolio management, and risk measurement.

In summary, this paper introduces a new approach for computing high order derivatives and sensitivities of financial options using vibrato and automatic differentiation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of this method compared with standard approaches used in finance. We believe that this methodology will be of great value to practitioners in the financial industry and researchers in the fields of applied mathematics and computational finance.","(283, 11)","This paper deals with the computation of second or higher order greeks of financial securities.

In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by developing a novel approach that combines the vibrato algorithm with AD.  Our goal is to provide a robust and efficient method for computing high order greeks, which are essential for risk management and portfolio optimization.

The vibrato algorithm is based on the idea of perturbing the input variables of a function and measuring the resulting change in the output.  By repeating this process multiple times, it is possible to estimate high order derivatives of the function.  However, the accuracy of the vibrato algorithm depends on the choice of perturbation size and the number of iterations.  AD, on the other hand, is a technique for computing derivatives of a function by tracing the flow of information through the computation graph.  It is a powerful tool for sensitivity analysis and has been widely used in finance for computing first and second order greeks.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both the vibrato algorithm and AD.  We use AD to compute the first and second order derivatives of the option pricing model, and then apply the vibrato algorithm as a post-processing step to estimate higher order derivatives.  This approach allows us to take advantage of the efficiency and accuracy of AD for lower order derivatives, while still being able to compute high order derivatives using the vibrato algorithm.

We test our approach on a range of option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model and the Heston model.

--- Objectives --- Prior to foetal karyotyping, the likelihood of Down's syndrome is often determined ","--- Objectives --- Prior to foetal karyotyping, the likelihood of Down's syndrome is often determined combining maternal age, serum free beta-HCG, PAPP-A levels and embryonic measurements of crown-rump length and nuchal translucency for gestational ages between 11 and 13 weeks. It appeared important to get a precise knowledge of these scan parameters' normal values during the first trimester. This paper focused on crown-rump length. --- METHODS --- 402 pregnancies from in-vitro fertilization allowing a precise estimation of foetal ages (FA) were used to determine the best model that describes crown-rump length (CRL) as a function of FA. Scan measures by a single operator from 3846 spontaneous pregnancies representative of the general population from Northern France were used to build a mathematical model linking FA and CRL in a context as close as possible to normal scan screening used in Down's syndrome likelihood determination. We modeled both CRL as a function of FA and FA as a function of CRL. For this, we used a clear methodology and performed regressions with heteroskedastic corrections and robust regressions.

The results were compared by cross-validation to retain the equations with the best predictive power. We also studied the errors between observed and predicted values. --- Results --- Data from 513 spontaneous pregnancies allowed to model CRL as a function of age of foetal age. The best model was a polynomial of degree 2. Datation with our equation that models spontaneous pregnancies from a general population was in quite agreement with objective datations obtained from 402 IVF pregnancies and thus support the validity of our model. The most precise measure of CRL was when the SD was minimal (1.83mm), for a CRL of 23.6 mm where our model predicted a 49.4 days of foetal age. Our study allowed to model the SD from 30 to 90 days of foetal age and offers the opportunity of using Zscores in the future to detect growth abnormalities. --- Conclusion --- With powerful statistical tools we report a good modeling of the first trimester embryonic growth in the general population allowing a better knowledge of the date of fertilization useful in the ultrasound screening of Down's syndrome. The optimal period to measure CRL and predict foetal age was 49.4 days (9 weeks of gestational age). Our results open the way to the detection of foetal growth abnormalities using CRL Zscores throughout the first trimester.","(437, 17)","In this study, we present our findings in creating new first trimester crown-rump length equations that have been optimized through structured data collection from a French general population. Early prenatal care is essential in ensuring the well-being of both the mother and the fetus. One crucial aspect of early prenatal care is the accurate measurement of the crown-rump length (CRL) of the fetus, which is used to estimate the gestational age of the fetus.

We aimed to develop new CRL equations that were optimized through structured data collection from a French general population. Our dataset consisted of 4,893 pregnant women who underwent routine ultrasound examinations during their first trimester. We gathered data on the CRL and gestational age of these women and developed new equations based on this data.

Our results showed that the CRL equations we developed were more accurate and precise in estimating gestational age than the currently used equations. Furthermore, our equations performed better across a wide range of gestational ages, which makes them more applicable to a diverse population.

One of the most significant contributions of our study is the use of a French general population in the optimization of the CRL equations. Previous studies have focused on specific subpopulations, which limits the applicability of the equations developed. By using a general population, our equations are more generalizable and applicable to a wider population.

Context. TypeState-Oriented Programming (TSOP) is a paradigm intended to help developers in the implementation and ","Context. TypeState-Oriented Programming (TSOP) is a paradigm intended to help developers in the implementation and use of mutable objects whose public interface depends on their private state. Under this paradigm, well-typed programs are guaranteed to conform with the protocol of the objects they use.

Inquiry. Previous works have investigated TSOP for both sequential and concurrent objects. However, an important difference between the two settings still remains. In a sequential setting, a well-typed program either progresses indefinitely or terminates eventually. In a concurrent setting, protocol conformance is no longer enough to avoid deadlocks, a situation in which the execution of the program halts because two or more objects are involved in mutual dependencies that prevent any further progress.

Approach. In this work, we put forward a refinement of TSOP for concurrent objects guaranteeing that well-typed programs not only conform with the protocol of the objects they use, but are also deadlock free. The key ingredients of the type system are behavioral types, used to specify and enforce object protocols, and dependency relations, used to represent abstract descriptions of the dependencies between objects and detect circularities that might cause deadlocks.

Knowledge. The proposed approach stands out for two features. First, the approach is fully compositional and therefore scalable: the objects of a large program can be type checked in isolation; deadlock freedom of an object composition solely depends on the types of the objects being composed; any modification/refactoring of an object that does not affect its public interface does not affect other objects either. Second, we provide the first deadlock analysis technique for join patterns, a high-level concurrency abstraction with which programmers can express complex synchronizations in a succinct and declarative form.

Grounding. We detail the proposed typing discipline for a core programming language blending concurrent objects, asynchronous message passing and join patterns. We prove that the type system is sound and give non-trivial examples of programs that can be successfully analyzed. A Haskell implementation of the type system that demonstrates the feasibility of the approach is publicly available.

Importance. The static analysis technique described in this work can be used to certify programs written in a core language for concurrent TSOP with proven correctness guarantees. This is an essential first step towards the integration and application of the technique in a real-world developer toolchain, making programming of such systems more productive and less frustrating.","(435, 22)","Deadlock-Free Typestate-Oriented Programming is a novel approach to programming, which aims at reducing the possibility of deadlocks in concurrent systems. In concurrent programming, these are situations where two or more processes are blocked, waiting for each other to release the resources they need to proceed. Typestate-oriented programming deals with the structure and behavior of objects by providing a formal description of their states and transitions between them.

This paper presents a comprehensive study of typestate-oriented programming and its application to the problem of deadlock prevention. We begin by providing a brief introduction to the concept of typestate and its importance in software engineering. We then describe the features and advantages of typestate-oriented programming, including its ability to improve code reliability, increase program efficiency, and simplify debugging.

Our main contribution is a novel approach to typestate-oriented programming that ensures deadlock freedom in concurrent systems. The approach involves using a combination of typestate specifications and static analysis techniques to detect potential conflicts and prevent deadlock situations. We present a formal specification of our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through a series of case studies.

We also discuss the limitations and challenges of our approach, as well as the potential directions of future research in this field. We propose several areas for improvement, such as integrating dynamic analysis techniques to further enhance the effectiveness of our approach.

To conclude, this paper provides a comprehensive study of deadlock-free typestate-oriented programming, presenting a new and effective approach to concurrent programming that aims to reduce the occurrence of deadlocks in software systems.

Research Question. This paper aims to address the issue of deadlocks in TSOP by proposing a novel approach that ensures deadlock-free execution of typestate-oriented programs.

Using the full data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ ","Using the full data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider, we present three recent measurements of time-dependent CP violation in $B$ decays, and a measurement of branching fraction of the $B^0\to\rho^0\rho^0$ decay. We studied $B\to\omega K$ decays and measured the values of CP violation parameters in $B^0\to\omega K^0_S$ to be $A_{\omega K^0_S} =-0.36\pm 0.19(stat)\pm 0.05(syst)$ and $S_{\omega K^0_S}= +0.91\pm 0.32 \pm 0.05 $, which gives the first evidence of CP violation in this decay. In addition, we measured the direct CP violation in $B^+\to\omega K^+$ to be $A_{CP} (B^+ \to \omega K^+)=-0.03\pm 0.04 \pm 0.01$, and two branching fractions $B(B^0 \to \omega K^0)=(4.5\pm 0.4\pm 0.3) \times 10^{-6}$ and $B(B^+ \to \omega K^+)=(6.8\pm 0.4 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-6}$ (preliminary).

From the measurement of CP violation parameters in the $B^0\to\eta'K^0$ decay we obtain $S_{\eta'K^0} = 0.68 \pm 0.07\pm 0.03$ and $A_{\eta'K^0} = +0.03 \pm 0.05\pm 0.04$ (preliminary), which are the world's most precise values to date.

Measuring CP violating parameters in the $B^0\to\pi^+\pi^-$ decay gives $A_{\pi^+\pi^-} = +0.33\pm 0.06\pm 0.03$ and $S_{\pi^+\pi^-} = -0.64\pm 0.08\pm 0.03$. This result is used in an isospin analysis to constrain the $\phi_2$ angle of the unitarity triangle, with which we rule out the region $23.8^\circ < \phi_2 < 66.8^\circ$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. The measured branching fraction of the $B^0\to\rho^0\rho^0$ decay is $B(B^0\to\rho^0\rho^0) = (1.02\pm 0.30\pm 0.15)\times 10^{-6}$, with the fraction of longitudinally polarized $\rho^0$ mesons being $f_L = 0.21^{+0.18}_{-0.22}\pm 0.13$. We obtain also the first evidence of the $B^0\to f_0\rho^0$ decay, by measuring $B(B^0\to f_0 \rho^0)\times B(f_0\to \pi^+\pi^-) = (0.86\pm 0.27 \pm 0.14)\times 10^{-6}$.","(427, 8)","This paper presents the measurement of time-dependent CP violation in $B$ decays using the Belle detector at the KEKB collider. The study utilized a data sample consisting of $772 \times 10^6$ $B\bar{B}$ events collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance during the Belle phase II data taking period. The analysis primarily focuses on the decay modes of the $B^0$ and $\overline{B}{}^0$ mesons to $CP$ eigenstates such as $J/\psi K_0^*$ and $\psi(2S) K_S^0$. The time evolution of these decays were studied through the measurement of the difference in decay times between the neutral $B$ meson that decays to the $CP$ eigenstate and its corresponding flavor-specific partner.

The analysis yielded the following measurements of the time-dependent CP asymmetry parameters: $S_{J/\psi K_0^*} = -0.73 \pm 0.17 \pm 0.05$ and $C_{J/\psi K_0^*} = 0.01 \pm 0.13 \pm 0.03$ for $B^0 \to J/\psi K_0^*$, and $S_{\psi(2S)K_S^0} = 0.55 \pm 0.22 \pm 0.05$ and $C_{\psi(2S)K_S^0} = 0.00 \pm 0.16 \pm 0.04$ for $B^0 \to \psi(2S) K_S^0$. These measurements are consistent with those previously reported by the Belle and BaBar experiments.

The results are used to constrain the parameters of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which describes the mixing of the three generations of quarks in the Standard Model. A global fit of the CKM matrix elements is performed, assuming the universality of the CKM matrix, and the constraint on the ratio $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$ is obtained as $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}| = 0.083 \pm 0.003 \pm 0.004$, where the first uncertainty is experimental and the second one is due to theoretical uncertainties.

This result is consistent with other determinations of $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$ in the literature, and contributes to the overall understanding of CP violation in the Standard Model. Furthermore, these results provide information on the CKM parameters which will aid in the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.","(421, 10)","Using the full data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$  collision facility, we investigate the time-dependent CP-violating asymmetry in $B \to D^{(*)} h$ decays, where $h$ represents a light hadron ($\pi^0$, $\eta$, $\eta'$, $\rho^0$, $\omega$) or a vector meson ($\phi$, $K^{*0}$, $K^{*+}$). This study aims to provide a precise measurement of the CP-violating parameter $S_f$, which is sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Our analysis is based on a sample of $772 \times 10^6$ $B \bar{B}$ pairs, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 711 fb$^{-1}$. We employ a time-dependent Dalitz plot analysis, which allows us to extract the CP-violating parameters $S_f$ and $C_f$ from the decay rates of $B^0$ and $\bar{B}^0$ mesons as a function of the time difference between the $B$-meson decay and the $e^+ e^-$ collision. The Dalitz plot is a two-dimensional representation of the $D^{(*)}h$ invariant mass squared, providing a powerful tool for disentangling the various decay modes and extracting the relevant CP-violating parameters.

We observe a significant CP-violating effect in the $B^0 \to D^0 \pi^0$ decay mode, with a measured value of $S_{\pi^0} = -0.65 \pm 0.12 \pm 0.\text{stat}$, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. This result is in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction, which is based on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element $V_{cb}$.

The spinor representation is developed for conformal immersions of Riemann surfaces into space. We adapt ","The spinor representation is developed for conformal immersions of Riemann surfaces into space. We adapt the approach of Dennis Sullivan, which treats a spin structure on a Riemann surface M as a complex line bundle S whose square is the canonical line bundle K=T(M). Given a conformal immersion of M into \bbR^3, the unique spin strucure on S^2 pulls back via the Gauss map to a spin structure S on M, and gives rise to a pair of smooth sections (s_1,s_2) of S.

Conversely, any pair of sections of S generates a (possibly periodic) conformal immersion of M under a suitable integrability condition, which for a minimal surface is simply that the spinor sections are meromorphic. A spin structure S also determines (and is determined by) the regular homotopy class of the immersion by way of a \bbZ_2-quadratic form q_S. We present an analytic expression for the Arf invariant of q_S, which decides whether or not the correponding immersion can be deformed to an embedding. The Arf invariant also turns out to be an obstruction, for example, to the existence of certain complete minimal immersions. The later parts of this paper use the spinor representation to investigate minimal surfaces with embedded planar ends. In general, we show for a spin structure S on a compact Riemann surface M with punctures at P that the space of all such (possibly periodic) minimal immersions of M\setminus P into \bbR^3 (upto homothety) is the the product of S^1\times H^3 with the Grassmanian of 2-planes in a complex vector space \calK of meromorphic sections of S. An important tool -- a skew-symmetric form \Omega defined by residues of a certain meromorphic quadratic differential on M -- lets us compute how \calK varies as M and P are varied. Then we apply this to determine the moduli spaces of planar-ended minimal spheres and real projective planes, and also to construct a new family of minimal tori and a minimal Klein bottle with 4 ends. These surfaces compactify in S^3 to yield surfaces critical for the \Moebius invariant squared mean curvature functional W. On the other hand, Robert Bryant has shown all W-critical spheres and real projective planes arise this way.

Spinors, objects widely used in quantum mechanics and high-energy physics, can also be used to derive important properties of surfaces in space. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the spinor representation of surfaces in space, and its application in understanding the shape, orientation and intrinsic geometry of these surfaces. 

Our analysis shows that spinors can be used to provide a comprehensive formulation of surface geometry, which is independent of Euclidean frames of reference. We explore the use of spinors to encode the intrinsic curvature of surfaces, and demonstrate that their explicit expression can be used to characterize the global properties of a surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate how spinors allow for a natural extension of classical differential geometry results, and provide new insights into the geometric characteristics of surfaces which cannot be captured by traditional methods. 

We also explore the role of spinors in describing the orientation of surfaces in space relative to one another. Through a series of algebraic and geometric arguments, we establish how spinors may be used to capture the notion of parallelism between surfaces, and show that this results in a powerful tool for analyzing the relative geometries of surfaces in a more comprehensive and efficient manner than previously thought possible. 

Overall, our results highlight the versatility and power of spinors as a tool in the study of surfaces in space. We provide a comprehensive overview of their applications to surface geometry, curvature and orientation, and demonstrate their ability to capture and extend traditional results in differential geometry.

We present an attempt to reach realistic turbulent regime in direct numerical simulations of the ","We present an attempt to reach realistic turbulent regime in direct numerical simulations of the geodynamo. We rely on a sequence of three convection-driven simulations in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. The most extreme case reaches towards the Earth's core regime by lowering viscosity (magnetic Prandtl number Pm=0.1) while maintaining vigorous convection (magnetic Reynolds number Rm>500) and rapid rotation (Ekman number E=1e-7), at the limit of what is feasible on today's supercomputers. A detailed and comprehensive analysis highlights several key features matching geomagnetic observations or dynamo theory predictions -- all present together in the same simulation -- but it also unveils interesting insights relevant for Earth's core dynamics.In this strong-field, dipole-dominated dynamo simulation, the magnetic energy is one order of magnitude larger than the kinetic energy. The spatial distribution of magnetic intensity is highly heterogeneous, and a stark dynamical contrast exists between the interior and the exterior of the tangent cylinder (the cylinder parallel to the axis of rotation that circumscribes the inner core).In the interior, the magnetic field is strongest, and is associated with a vigorous twisted polar vortex, whose dynamics may occasionally lead to the formation of a reverse polar flux patch at the surface of the shell.

Furthermore, the strong magnetic field also allows accumulation of light material within the tangent cylinder, leading to stable stratification there.

Torsional Alfv{\'e}n waves are frequently triggered in the vicinity of the tangent cylinder and propagate towards the equator.Outside the tangent cylinder, the magnetic field inhibits the growth of zonal winds and the kinetic energy is mostly non-zonal. Spatio-temporal analysis indicates that the low-frequency, non-zonal flow is quite geostrophic (columnar) and predominantly large-scale: an m=1 eddy spontaneously emerges in our most extreme simulations, without any heterogeneous boundary forcing.Our spatio-temporal analysis further reveals that (i) the low-frequency, large-scale flow is governed by a balance between Coriolis and buoyancy forces -- magnetic field and flow tend to align, minimizing the Lorentz force; (ii) the high-frequency flow obeys a balance between magnetic and Coriolis forces; (iii) the convective plumes mostly live at an intermediate scale, whose dynamics is driven by a 3-term 1 MAC balance -- involving Coriolis, Lorentz and buoyancy forces. However, small-scale (E^{1/3}) quasi-geostrophic convection is still observed in the regions of low magnetic intensity.","(435, 9)","The Earth's magnetic field is a vital shield that protects it from the solar wind and cosmic radiation. This magnetic field is generated by the geodynamo, a self-sustaining natural process of fluid flow in the Earth's core. Understanding the geodynamo is crucial to comprehend Earth's magnetic field and its influence on the planet's habitability. In this paper, we present simulations of the geodynamo, in particular, the turbulent nature of its convective flows.

Our simulations, which solve the magnetohydrodynamic equations, reveal new insights into the geodynamo's dynamics. The simulations simulate the fluid motion and magnetic field in the Earth's core with spatial and temporal resolutions never achieved before, using state-of-the-art supercomputing. In particular, we investigated the effects of the Earth's rotation and mantle core boundary on the geodynamo's convective flows.

Our results suggest that the turbulent motions of the geodynamo play a central role in generating the magnetic field. The fluctuations produced by these turbulent flows produce small-scale magnetic fields by stretching and twisting the magnetic field lines. These fields eventually merge into larger fields on longer timescales. This process generates the strong, large-scale magnetic fields observed on Earth's surface.

Our simulations also reveal that the mantle core boundary has a significant impact on the geodynamo's dynamics. The boundary controls the amount of heat leaving the core, which affects the convective flow. Our simulations show that different models of the mantle core boundary can lead to significant changes in the geodynamo's behavior and magnetic field.

Our findings provide new insights into the fundamental physics of the geodynamo and the generation of Earth's magnetic field. Our simulations demonstrate that the turbulent nature of the geodynamo's convective flows play a central role in generating the magnetic field, which is essential for the Earth's habitability. Moreover, our work provides a solid foundation for future studies investigating the effects of other parameters, such as the viscosity of the core or the magnetic diffusivity of the mantle core boundary, on the geodynamo's behavior. Ultimately, our simulations represent an exciting leap forward in our understanding of the geodynamo and its critical role in the Earth's dynamics.","(398, 18)","We present an attempt to reach realistic turbulent regime in direct numerical simulations of the 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) geodynamo.

Our simulations revealed a complex interplay between the fluid flow, magnetic field, and thermal buoyancy, leading to the emergence of a self-sustaining dynamo. The resulting magnetic field exhibited a dipolar structure, with a dominant axisymmetric component and a weaker non-axisymmetric component. The secular variation of the magnetic field, characterized by the rate of change of the magnetic field over time, was found to be consistent with observations.

### | Explanation |
###
The geodynamo is the dynamo that generates the Earth's magnetic field.
The magnetic field is generated by the motion of electrically conducting fluids in the outer core of the Earth.
The motion of these fluids is driven by the differential rotation of the Earth and the Coriolis force.
The differential rotation is caused by the heat flow from the inner core to the outer core.
The heat flow causes the outer core to rotate faster than the inner core.
As a result, the outer core has a higher angular velocity than the inner one.
This difference in angular velocity is called the [Coriolis effect](","(235, 12)","We present an attempt to reach realistic turbulent regime in direct numerical simulations of the 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) geodynamo.

When can we compute the diameter of a graph in quasi linear time? We address ","When can we compute the diameter of a graph in quasi linear time? We address this question for the class of {\em split graphs}, that we observe to be the hardest instances for deciding whether the diameter is at most two. We stress that although the diameter of a non-complete split graph can only be either $2$ or $3$, under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH) we cannot compute the diameter of an $n$-vertex $m$-edge split graph in less than quadratic time -- in the size $n+m$ of the input. Therefore it is worth to study the complexity of diameter computation on {\em subclasses} of split graphs, in order to better understand the complexity border. Specifically, we consider the split graphs with bounded {\em clique-interval number} and their complements, with the former being a natural variation of the concept of interval number for split graphs that we introduce in this paper. We first discuss the relations between the clique-interval number and other graph invariants such as the classic interval number of graphs, the treewidth, the {\em VC-dimension} and the {\em stabbing number} of a related hypergraph. Then, in part based on these above relations, we almost completely settle the complexity of diameter computation on these subclasses of split graphs: - For the $k$-clique-interval split graphs, we can compute their diameter in truly subquadratic time if $k={\cal O}(1)$, and even in quasi linear time if $k=o(\log{n})$ and in addition a corresponding ordering of the vertices in the clique is given.

However, under SETH this cannot be done in truly subquadratic time for any $k = \omega(\log{n})$. - For the {\em complements} of $k$-clique-interval split graphs, we can compute their diameter in truly subquadratic time if $k={\cal O}(1)$, and even in time ${\cal O}(km)$ if a corresponding ordering of the vertices in the stable set is given. Again this latter result is optimal under SETH up to polylogarithmic factors. Our findings raise the question whether a $k$-clique interval ordering can always be computed in quasi linear time. We prove that it is the case for $k=1$ and for some subclasses such as bounded-treewidth split graphs, threshold graphs and comparability split graphs. Finally, we prove that some important subclasses of split graphs -- including the ones mentioned above -- have a bounded clique-interval number.","(488, 13)","Split graphs are important mathematical structures that have numerous applications in various fields, such as computer science, social network analysis, and communication networks. The diameter of a split graph is defined as the maximum distance between any two vertices in the graph. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that can compute the diameter of split graphs in a fast and efficient way.

Our algorithm is based on a divide-and-conquer approach, which splits the original graph into smaller subproblems, and then combines the solutions to these subproblems to obtain the final diameter of the original graph. The key idea is to exploit the special properties of split graphs, which allow us to reduce the size of the problem and compute the diameter in linear time.

Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms for computing the diameter of split graphs. In particular, our algorithm can compute the diameter of large split graphs with millions of vertices and edges in a matter of minutes, which is orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms.

We also show that our algorithm can be extended to compute the eccentricity of vertices in split graphs, which is a measure of how far a vertex is from all other vertices in the graph. This is an important problem in network analysis, as it helps to identify the most important or central nodes in the graph.

In conclusion, our algorithm provides a fast and efficient way to compute the diameter and eccentricity of split graphs, which can have important applications in various fields beyond the scope of this paper.

We analyze these oscillations and we propose a simple model which includes the minimal ingredients to produce the oscillatory behavior. Phase transitions in binary mixtures are still a widely studied subject, specifically near the critical point where several interesting and not completely understood phenomena may appear, among them we recall the critical Casimir forces [2],[3], confinement effects [4], [5] and out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quench. The perturbation of the binary mixtures by mean of external fields is also an important and recent field of investigation [6]. For example, a laser can induce interesting phenomena in demixing binary mixtures because the radiation pressure can deform the interface between the two phases and it can be used to measure the interface tension [7]. Depending on the nature of the binary mixtures, laser illumination can also lead to a mixing or demixing transition. In ref.[8], focused infrared laser light heats the medium initially in the homogeneous phase and causes a separation in the LCST (Low Critical Solution Temperature) system. The radiation pressure gradients in a laser beam also contribute in the aggregation of polymers , thus producing a phase transition. The local heating may induce thermophoretic forces which attract towards the laser beam one of the binary-mixture components [9]. Other forces like electrostriction can also be involved [10]. In this letter, we report a new phenomenon, which consists in an oscillating phase transition induced by a constant illumination from an infrared laser beam in the heterogeneous region of an UCST (Upper Critical Solution Temperature) binary mixture. Oscillation phenomena in phase transition have already been reported in slow cooling UCST [11],[12] but as far as we know, never induced by a stationary laser illumination. After describing our experimental setup , we will present the results. Then we will use a very simplified model which contains the main necessary physical ingredients to induce this oscillation phenomenon.","(458, 17)","This paper examines a phenomenon in which phase transitions in materials can be induced and controlled through the use of a strongly focused laser beam. The study of phase transitions is an important area of research in the field of materials science, with many practical applications such as in the development of new materials for use in electronics and energy storage devices. In this paper, we present experimental evidence of a novel mechanism for inducing phase transitions through the use of a laser beam with a focus size smaller than the phase coexistence region. This effect is observed in a variety of materials, including metallic and oxide films, and is found to be highly dependent on the laser power and pulse duration.

One intriguing result of our experiments is the observation of oscillations in the phase-transition behavior of some materials when subjected to a strongly focused laser beam. Specifically, we observe oscillations in the depth of the phase coexistence region as a function of the laser power and pulse duration. We find that these oscillations arise due to a feedback mechanism between the laser-induced melting and the subsequent evolution of the material's microstructure. Our simulations suggest that the presence of a liquid layer in an otherwise solid material leads to a significant reduction in the absorption of laser energy and hence a reduced melting depth. Meanwhile, the cooling process leads to the formation of a new solid phase and the eventual re-establishment of the original coexistence region.

To elucidate this phenomenon, we further investigate the dependence of the oscillatory behavior on various parameters such as laser beam size and material composition. We find that the oscillations are most pronounced when the laser is strongly focused and at higher power densities, and are less pronounced for materials with larger coexistence regions or when the focus size exceeds the coexistence region.

Our results provide important insights into the complex behavior of strongly driven phase transitions, and may have implications for a diverse range of applications including the development of new materials and novel laser-based technologies. We believe that this work will stimulate further research in this area, and will lead to a deeper understanding of the fundamental physics underlying laser-induced phase transitions.","(394, 13)","We report here the observation of a surprising phenomenon consisting in a oscillating phase transition  induced by a highly focused laser beam. This effect has been observed in a variety of materials, including metals, semiconductors, and insulators, and is characterized by a periodic change in the material's state from a disordered to an ordered phase and vice versa. The oscillations occur at a frequency that depends on the intensity of the laser beam and the properties of the material.

Our research aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon and to explore its potential applications. To this end, we employed a range of experimental techniques, including time-resolved X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and optical spectroscopy. These methods allowed us to monitor the material's structural and electronic properties in real-time as the laser beam was applied.

Our results show that the phase transition oscillations are a result of a complex interplay between the laser-induced heating and the material's thermodynamic properties. Specifically, we found that the laser beam causes a rapid increase in the material's temperature, which leads to a disordering of the material's crystal structure. However, as the temperature continues to rise, the material's entropy increases, causing it to transition into a more ordered phase. This process is accompanied by a release of energy, which in turn causes the material's temperature to decrease, leading to a reordering of the crystal structure and a return to the disordered phase. This cycle of heating and cooling repeats periodically, resulting in the observed oscillations.

We also found that the frequency of the oscillations is directly proportional to the square root of the laser intensity and inversely proportional to the thermal conductivity of the material. This suggests that the oscillations are driven by a balance between the rate of heating and the rate of cooling, which is influenced by the material's thermal properties.

The implications of our findings are significant, as they suggest that phase transition oscillations could be used to create novel materials with unique properties. For example, by carefully controlling the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations, it may be possible to create materials with tailored thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, or optical properties. Additionally, the ability to induce phase transitions in a controlled and repeatable manner could have important applications in fields such as materials science, condensed matter physics, and nanotechnology.

We present physical results for a variety of light hadronic quantities obtained via a combined ","We present physical results for a variety of light hadronic quantities obtained via a combined analysis of three 2+1 flavour domain wall fermion ensemble sets. For two of our ensemble sets we used the Iwasaki gauge action with beta=2.13 (a^-1=1.75(4) GeV) and beta=2.25 (a^-1=2.31(4) GeV) and lattice sizes of 24^3 x 64 and 32^3 x 64 respectively, with unitary pion masses in the range 293(5)-417(10) MeV. The extent L_s for the 5^th dimension of the domain wall fermion formulation is L_s=16 in these ensembles. In this analysis we include a third ensemble set that makes use of the novel Iwasaki+DSDR (Dislocation Suppressing Determinant Ratio) gauge action at beta = 1.75 (a^-1=1.37(1) GeV) with a lattice size of 32^3 x 64 and L_s=32 to reach down to partially-quenched pion masses as low as 143(1) MeV and a unitary pion mass of 171(1) MeV, while retaining good chiral symmetry and topological tunneling. We demonstrate a significant improvement in our control over the chiral extrapolation, resulting in much improved continuum predictions for the above quantities. The main results of this analysis include the pion and kaon decay constants, f_\pi=127(3)_{stat}(3)_{sys} MeV and f_K = 152(3)_{stat}(2)_{sys} MeV respectively (f_K/f_\pi = 1.199(12)_{stat}(14)_{sys}); the average up/down quark mass and the strange-quark mass in the MSbar-scheme at 3 GeV, m_{ud}(MSbar, 3 GeV) = 3.05(8)_{stat}(6)_{sys} MeV and m_s(MSbar, 3 GeV) = 83.5(1.7)_{stat}(1.1)_{sys}; the neutral kaon mixing parameter in the MSbar-scheme at 3 GeV, B_K(MSbar,3 GeV) = 0.535(8)_{stat}(13)_{sys}, and in the RGI scheme, \hat B_K = 0.758(11)_{stat}(19)_{sys}; and the Sommer scales r_1 = 0.323(8)_{stat}(4)_{sys} fm and r_0 = 0.480(10)_{stat}(4)_{sys} (r_1/r_0 = 0.673(11)_{stat}(3)_{sys}). We also obtain values for the SU(2) ChPT effective couplings, \bar{l_3} = 2.91(23)_{stat}(7)_{sys}$ and \bar{l_4} = 3.99(16)_{stat}(9)_{sys}.","(524, 7)","Domain wall quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is a powerful tool for simulating the strong force interactions between quarks and gluons. One important challenge is to carry out simulations that take into account the effects of dynamical quarks. In this paper, we investigate the use of near-physical pions in domain wall QCD simulations.

Near-physical pions provide an important probe for understanding the structure and dynamics of hadrons, which are composite particles made up of quarks and gluons. These pions can be used to test the predictions of QCD about the properties of hadrons, and to explore the phase structure of the theory.

One key aspect of our work is the use of domain wall fermions, which provide a way to treat the effects of dynamical quarks in QCD simulations. These fermions are designed to reproduce the behavior of quarks in the continuum limit of the theory, which is an important goal for QCD simulations.

Our simulations were performed using state-of-the-art supercomputers, which allowed us to explore a range of parameters for the pion masses and to study the effect of finite size on the results. We found that domain wall QCD with near-physical pions provides a powerful new tool for studying the properties of hadrons and the phase structure of QCD.

Our results demonstrate the importance of taking into account the effects of dynamical quarks in QCD simulations and the potential of near-physical pions as a probe for exploring the structure and dynamics of hadrons. We also discuss future directions for research in this area, including the use of improved domain wall fermions and the development of new techniques for analyzing the results.","(291, 11)","We present physical results for a variety of light hadronic quantities obtained via a combined 2+1 flavor Domain Wall QCD (DWQCD) simulation with near-physical pion masses.

This setup allows us to study the properties of light hadrons in a regime that is closer to the physical point than previous DWQCD simulations.

Our analysis focuses on the calculation of various light hadronic quantities, including the pion decay constant $f_\pi$, the kaon decay constant $f_K$, the pion electromagnetic form factor $F_\pi(Q^2)$, and the nucleon axial charge $g_A$. These quantities are crucial for understanding the strong interaction and have significant implications for particle physics beyond the Standard Model. Our results for $f_\pi$ and $f_K$ are found to be in good agreement with experimental values, indicating that the HISQ action is well-suited for describing the low-energy dynamics of QCD. Furthermore, we observe a non-trivial dependence of the pion form factor on the squared momentum transfer $Q^2$, which is consistent with expectations from chiral perturbation theory.

In addition to these results, we also investigate the properties of the nucleon, including its axial charge and magnetic moment. Our calculation of $g_A$ yields a value that is consistent with experimental measurements, providing further evidence for the accuracy of the HISQ action in describing the strong interaction.

Hong and Wang refined the results of Erd\""{o}s and Niven, and of Chen and Tang by showing that $H_{k,f}(n)$ is not an integer if $n\geq 4$ and $f(x)=ax+b$ with $a$ and $b$ being positive integers. Meanwhile, Luo, Hong, Qian and Wang established the similar result when $f(x)$ is of nonnegative integer coefficients and of degree no less than two. For any $k$-tuple $\vec{s}=(s_1, ..., s_k)$ of positive integers, Pilehrood, Pilehrood and Tauraso proved that $H_{k,f}(\vec{s},n)$ and $H_{k,f}^*(\vec{s},n)$ are nearly never integers if $f(x)=x$. In this paper, we show that if $f(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial of nonnegative integer coefficients such that either $\deg f(x)\ge 2$ or $f(x)$ is linear and $s_j\ge 2$ for all integers $j$ with $1\le j\le k$, then $H_{k,f}(\vec{s}, n)$ and $H_{k,f}^*(\vec{s}, n)$ are not integers except for the case $f(x)=x^{m}$ with $m\geq1$ being an integer and $n=k=1$, in which case, both of $H_{k,f}(\vec{s}, n)$ and $H_{k,f}^*(\vec{s}, n)$ are integers.

Furthermore, we prove that if $f(x)=2x-1$, then both $H_{k,f}(\vec{s}, n)$ and $H_{k,f}^*(\vec{s}, n)$ are not integers except when $n=1$, in which case $H_{k,f}(\vec{s}, n)$ and $H_{k,f}^*(\vec{s}, n)$ are integers.

This paper concerns Hodge-Dirac operators D = d + $\delta$ acting in L p ($\Omega$, ","This paper concerns Hodge-Dirac operators D = d + $\delta$ acting in L p ($\Omega$, {\lambda}) where $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of R n satisfying some kind of Lipschitz condition, {\lambda} is the exterior algebra of R n , d is the exterior derivative acting on the de Rham complex of differential forms on $\Omega$, and $\delta$ is the interior derivative with tangential boundary conditions. In L 2 ($\Omega$, {\lambda}), $\delta$ = d * and D is self-adjoint, thus having bounded resolvents (I + itD) --1 t$\in$R as well as a bounded functional calculus in L 2 ($\Omega$, {\lambda}). We investigate the range of values p H \textless{} p \textless{} p H about p = 2 for which D has bounded resolvents and a bounded holomorphic functional calculus in L p ($\Omega$, {\lambda}). On domains which we call very weakly Lipschitz, we show that this is the same range of values as for which L p ($\Omega$, {\lambda}) has a Hodge (or Helmholz) decomposition, being an open interval that includes 2. The Hodge-Laplacian {\Delta} is the square of the Hodge-Dirac operator, i.e.

--{\Delta} = D 2 , so it also has a bounded functional calculus in L p ($\Omega$, {\lambda}) when p H \textless{} p \textless{} p H. But the Stokes operator with Hodge boundary conditions, which is the restriction of --{\Delta} to the subspace of divergence free vector fields in L p ($\Omega$, {\lambda} 1) with tangential boundary conditions , has a bounded holomorphic functional calculus for further values of p, namely for max{1, p H S } \textless{} p \textless{} p H where p H S is the Sobolev exponent below p H , given by 1/p H S = 1/p H + 1/n, so that p H S \textless{} 2n/(n + 2). In 3 dimensions, p H S \textless{} 6/5. We show also that for bounded strongly Lipschitz domains $\Omega$, p H \textless{} 2n/(n + 1) \textless{} 2n/(n -- 1) \textless{} p H , in agreement with the known results that p H \textless{} 4/3 \textless{} 4 \textless{} p H in dimension 2, and p H \textless{} 3/2 \textless{} 3 \textless{} p H in dimension 3.

The Hodge-Dirac operator is a fundamental operator in the theory of geometric analysis and geometry itself. It is often used in differential geometry to connect different complexes and in the study of geometric flows. The Hodge-Laplacian is a generalization of the Laplace operator and is defined in terms of the Hodge decomposition of differential forms. It is commonly used in the study of elliptic operators and the cohomology of manifolds. 

In this paper, we explore the properties of these operators on Lipschitz domains. Our main result concerns the existence and regularity of solutions to the Hodge-Dirac equation on such domains. We prove that under appropriate conditions on the domain and the coefficients of the equation, there exists a unique solution to the equation in L^p spaces. Our analysis relies on the study of the spectrum of the Hodge-Dirac operator and the use of the Fredholm theory of elliptic operators.

We also study the Hodge-Laplacian on Lipschitz domains and establish its properties in L^p spaces. We show that this operator is an isomorphism between appropriate spaces and that its inverse is bounded. We establish its lower bounds with precise geometric estimates, thereby providing results on cohomology of manifolds and the L^p theory of elliptic equations.

Finally, we consider the Hodge-Stokes operators on Lipschitz domains and look at the properties of its dual. We prove the boundedness of the operators and their duals between appropriate spaces, which results in new estimates on the regularity of solutions to related elliptic problems.

We study the 2D full Ginzburg-Landau energy with a periodic rapidly oscillating, discontinuous and [strongly] ","We study the 2D full Ginzburg-Landau energy with a periodic rapidly oscillating, discontinuous and [strongly] diluted pinning term using a perturbative argument. This energy models the state of an heterogeneous type II supercon-ductor submitted to a magnetic field. We calculate the value of the first critical field which links the presence of vorticity defects with the intensity of the applied magnetic field. Then we prove a standard dependance of the quantized vorticity defects with the intensity of the applied field. Our study includes the case of a London solution having several minima. The macroscopic location of the vor-ticity defects is understood with the famous Bethuel-Brezis-H{\'e}lein renormalized energy. The mesoscopic location, i.e., the arrangement of the vorticity defects around the minima of the London solution, is the same than in the homogenous case. The microscopic location is exactly the same than in the heterogeneous case without magnetic field. We also compute the value of secondary critical fields that increment the quantized vorticity. 1. Introdution This article studies the pinning phenomenon in type-II superconducting composites. Superconductivity is a property that appears in certain materials cooled below a critical temperature. These materials are called superconductors. Superconductivity is characterized by a total absence of electrical resistance and a perfect diamagnetism.

Unfortunately, when the imposed conditions are too intense, superconductivity is destroyed in certain areas of the material called vorticity defects. We are interested in type II superconductors which are characterized by the fact that the vorticity defects first appear in small areas. Their number increases with the intensity of the conditions imposed until filling the material. For example, when the intensity h ex of an applied magnetic field exceeds a first threshold, the first vorticity defects appear: the magnetic field begins to penetrate the superconductor. The penetration is done along thin wires and may move resulting an energy dissipation. These motions may be limited by trapping the vorticity defects in small areas. The behavior of a superconductor is modeled by minimizers of a Ginzburg-Landau type energy. In order to study the presence of traps for the vorticity defects we consider an energy including a pinning term that models impurities in the supercon-ductor. These impurities would play the role of traps for the vorticity defects. We are thus lead to the subject of this article: the type-II superconducting composites with impurities.","(428, 24)","The study focuses on the analysis of magnetic Ginzburg-Landau energy comprising a periodic rapidly oscillating and diluted pinning term. This topic is of great interest in the field of condensed matter physics where understanding the behavior of superconducting materials is paramount in developing new technologies and devices.

The paper presents new analytical and numerical results that demonstrate the influence of the aforementioned pinning term on the magnetic energy landscape. Specifically, we show that the term induces a secondary energy scale that modifies the phase diagram of the superconductor. The modified phase diagram displays a novel set of distinctive features, such as a series of phase transitions that are controllable by the frequency and amplitude of the pinning term.

To achieve these results, we developed a theoretical model combining the Ginzburg-Landau free energy with a pinning potential of the form V(x) = λcos(kx)exp(-x/ξ). We used perturbation theory to derive an efficient analytical approximant form for the pinning term, which is shown to accurately predict the behavior of the full model. We further confirmed our results numerically, using a combination of Monte-Carlo and finite-difference methods.

Our findings highlight the versatile and nuanced behavior of superconducting materials under external perturbation, which is relevant for many applications such as magnetic resonance imaging and high-precision sensing. Moreover, we underscore the importance of sophisticated theoretical models, which are capable of capturing the rich behavior of strongly-interacting systems in condensed matter physics.

The nearby star Fomalhaut harbours a cold, moderately eccentric dust belt with a sharp inner ","The nearby star Fomalhaut harbours a cold, moderately eccentric dust belt with a sharp inner edge near 133 au. A low-mass, common proper motion companion (Fom b), was discovered near the inner edge and was identified as a planet candidate that could account for the belt morphology. However, the most recent orbit determination based on four epochs of astrometry over eight years reveals a highly eccentric orbit that appears to cross the belt in the sky plane projection. We perform here a full orbital determination based on the available astrometric data to independently validate the orbit estimates previously presented. Adopting our values for the orbital elements and their associated uncertainties, we then study the dynamical interaction between the planet and the dust ring, to check whether the proposed disk sculpting scenario by Fom b is plausible. We used a dedicated MCMC code to derive the statistical distributions of the orbital elements of Fom b. Then we used symplectic N-body integration to investigate the dynamics of the dust belt, as perturbed by a single planet. Different attempts were made assuming different masses for Fom b. We also performed a semi-analytical study to explain our results. Our results are in good agreement with others regarding the orbit of Fom b. We find that the orbit is highly eccentric, is close to apsidally aligned with the belt, and has a moderate mutual inclination relative to the belt plane of. If coplanar, this orbit crosses the disk. Our dynamical study then reveals that the observed planet could sculpt a transient belt configuration with a similar eccentricity to what is observed, but it would not be simultaneously apsidally aligned with the planet. This transient configuration only occurs a short time after the planet is placed on such an orbit (assuming an initially circular disk), a time that is inversely proportional to the planet's mass, and that is in any case much less than the 440 Myr age of the star. We constrain how long the observed dust belt could have survived with Fom b on its current orbit, as a function of its possible mass. This analysis leads us to conclude that Fom b is likely to have low mass, that it is unlikely to be responsible for the sculpting of the belt, and that it supports the hypothesis of a more massive, less eccentric planet companion Fom c.","(432, 16)","This study presents an independent determination of Fomalhaut b's orbit and investigates its dynamical effects on the outer dust belt. Fomalhaut b is a directly imaged exoplanet located in the Fomalhaut system, approximately 25 light-years away from Earth. Previous studies have suggested that Fomalhaut b has a highly eccentric orbit, contributing to the disruption of the outer dust belt. Our study aims to provide a more accurate determination of Fomalhaut b's orbit and a deeper understanding of its effect on the dust belt.

To achieve this, we analyzed archival Hubble Space Telescope images spanning over 7 years and used astrometric techniques to measure the position and motion of Fomalhaut b. We combined these measurements with previous astrometric data and employed a statistical approach to compute the orbital parameters and their uncertainties. Our analysis indicates that Fomalhaut b's orbit is consistent with a highly eccentric ellipse, with a period of about 1600 years and a periastron distance of about 7.4 AU. The large eccentricity of the orbit suggests that Fomalhaut b is perturbed by a massive and distant object, which could be a yet undetected planet or a remnant of the protoplanetary disk.

We then employed numerical simulations to investigate the dynamical effects of Fomalhaut b on the outer dust belt. Our simulations include the gravitational perturbations of Fomalhaut b, the asymmetry of the dust belt, and the radiation pressure of the central star. We found that Fomalhaut b induces a series of azimuthal dust structures in the outer belt, which are consistent with the observed morphology. These structures are caused by the gravitational resonances between Fomalhaut b and the dust particles, and their locations and shapes depend on the orbital parameters of Fomalhaut b. Our simulations also suggest that Fomalhaut b's eccentricity is important for shaping the dust structures, as it determines the strength and duration of the gravitational perturbations.

Overall, our study provides a more accurate determination of Fomalhaut b's orbit and sheds new light on its dynamical effects on the outer dust belt. Our results have implications for the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems, and highlight the importance of studying the orbital dynamics of directly imaged planets.","(392, 15)","The nearby star Fomalhaut harbours a cold, moderately eccentric dust belt with a sharp inner 3:2 mean motion resonance (MMR) with the planet Fomalhautb.

We also incorporated observational data from the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Spitzer Space Telescope's InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) to constrain the model and provide a more accurate representation of the system.

We also found that the 3:2 MMR between the planet and the dust belt is responsible for the observed sharp inner edge of the dust belt. Furthermore, our simulations revealed that the planet's gravitational perturbations have a significant impact on the dust belt's structure and evolution, leading to the formation of a ring-like morphology.

The implications of our findings are far-reaching, providing new insights into the dynamics of planetary systems and the formation and evolution of dust belts. Our results suggest that the gravitational interactions between planets and dust particles play a crucial role in shaping the morphology of dust belts, and that these interactions can lead to the formation of complex structures such as rings and gaps. Additionally, our study highlights the importance of considering the dynamical effects of planets on dust belts when interpreting observational data and making predictions about the properties of exoplanetary systems.

Our work also has significant implications for the search for life beyond our solar system. The discovery of exoplanets and their associated dust belts provides valuable information about the potential habitability of these systems.

Furthermore, our simulations revealed that the planet's gravitational perturbations have a significant impact on the dust belt's structure and evolution, leading to the formation of a ring-like morphology.

The implications of our findings are far-reaching, providing new insights into the dynamics of planetary systems and the formation and evolution of dust belts. Our results suggest that the gravitational interactions between planets and dust particles play a crucial role in shaping the morphology of dust belts, and that these interactions can lead to the formation of complex structures such as rings and gaps. Additionally, our study highlights the importance of considering the dynamical effects of planets on dust belts when interpreting observational data and making predictions about the properties of exoplanetary systems.

Our work also has significant implications for the search for life beyond our solar system. The discovery of exoplanets and their associated dust belts provides valuable information about the potential habitability of these systems. By understanding the dynamics of dust belts and their interaction with planets, we can better assess the likelihood of life existing on exoplanets and inform the design of future missions to search for biosignatures.

In conclusion, our study presents a comprehensive and independent determination of Fomahault b's orbit and explores the dynamical effects its gravitational interactions have on the adjacent dust belt.

Lattice QCD with background magnetic fields is used to calculate the magnetic moments and magnetic ","Lattice QCD with background magnetic fields is used to calculate the magnetic moments and magnetic polarizabilities of the nucleons and of light nuclei with $A\le4$, along with the cross-section for the $M1$ transition $np\rightarrow d\gamma$, at the flavor SU(3)-symmetric point where the pion mass is $m_\pi\sim 806$ MeV. These magnetic properties are extracted from nucleon and nuclear energies in six uniform magnetic fields of varying strengths. The magnetic moments are presented in a recent Letter. For the charged states, the extraction of the polarizability requires careful treatment of Landau levels, which enter non-trivially in the method that is employed. The nucleon polarizabilities are found to be of similar magnitude to their physical values, with $\beta_p=5.22(+0.66/-0.45)(0.23) \times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$ and $\beta_n=1.253(+0.056/-0.067)(0.055) \times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, exhibiting a significant isovector component. The dineutron is bound at these heavy quark masses and its magnetic polarizability, $\beta_{nn}=1.872(+0.121/-0.113)(0.082) \times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$ differs significantly from twice that of the neutron. A linear combination of deuteron scalar and tensor polarizabilities is determined by the energies of the $j_z=\pm 1$ deuteron states, and is found to be $\beta_{d,\pm 1}=4.4(+1.6/-1.5)(0.2) \times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$. The magnetic polarizabilities of the three-nucleon and four-nucleon systems are found to be positive and similar in size to those of the proton, $\beta_{^{3}\rm He}=5.4(+2.2/-2.1)(0.2) \times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, $\beta_{^{3}\rm H}=2.6(1.7)(0.1) \times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, $\beta_{^{4}\rm He}=3.4(+2.0/-1.9)(0.2) \times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$. Mixing between the $j_z=0$ deuteron state and the spin-singlet $np$ state induced by the background magnetic field is used to extract the short-distance two-nucleon counterterm, ${\bar L}_1$, of the pionless effective theory for $NN$ systems (equivalent to the meson-exchange current contribution in nuclear potential models), that dictates the cross-section for the $np\to d\gamma$ process near threshold.

Combined with previous determinations of NN scattering parameters, this enables an ab initio determination of the threshold cross-section at these unphysical masses.","(485, 10)","The nature of the strong interaction that describes the behavior of matter at the subatomic scale remains one of the most challenging problems in modern physics. Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is a robust theoretical framework that enables investigations of this interaction through numerical simulations of QCD on a four-dimensional Euclidean lattice. By carrying out such simulations, we can study the properties of atomic nuclei and their magnetic structures. 

The magnetic moments of light nuclei, which are fundamental quantities that describe the strength and spatial orientation of their magnetic fields, can be precisely measured in experiments. However, a theoretical understanding of these magnetic moments requires a thorough understanding of the underlying strong interaction. In this paper, we present the results of our investigations into the magnetic structure of light nuclei from lattice QCD simulations. 

We employed the highly-improved staggered quark (HISQ) action to compute the nucleon and nuclear magnetic moments in lattice QCD simulations. Our calculations were carried out using a range of lattice spacings and volumes to ensure adequate control over systematic uncertainties. The results we present are the first quantitative predictions of the magnetic moments of nuclei computed fully from first principles of QCD.

Our findings demonstrate that quantitative data on the magnetic moments of light nuclei can be calculated using lattice QCD with negligible uncertainties. The magnetic moments of both the deuteron and the triton are predicted to be precisely zero in the absence of real or virtual electromagnetic interactions. Such interactions contribute significantly to the overall measured magnetic moments of these nuclei, and our results provide a reference point for their subtraction. 

In summary, we demonstrate that magnetic moments of light nuclei can be calculated using lattice QCD with high precision; such calculations also opens new possibilities for studying magnetic properties of nuclei at the subatomic scale.

The magnetic structure of these nuclei is probed by varying the magnetic field strength from 0 to 1.5 GeV^2, allowing for the extraction of the magnetic moments and the study of their dependence on the magnetic field.

Our results show that the magnetic moments of the proton and neutron are in good agreement with experiment, while the magnetic moments of deuterium and helium-3 are found to be significantly smaller than their experimental values.

We study in three dimensions the problem of a spatially homogeneous zero-temperature ideal Fermi gas ","We study in three dimensions the problem of a spatially homogeneous zero-temperature ideal Fermi gas of spin-polarized particles of mass $m$ perturbed by the presence of a single distinguishable impurity of mass $M$. The interaction between the impurity and the fermions involves only the partial $s$-wave through the scattering length $a$, and has negligible range $b$ compared to the inverse Fermi wave number $1/\kf$ of the gas. Through the interactions with the Fermi gas the impurity gives birth to a quasi-particle, which will be here a Fermi polaron (or more precisely a {\sl monomeron}). We consider the general case of an impurity moving with wave vector $\KK\neq\OO$: Then the quasi-particle acquires a finite lifetime in its initial momentum channel because it can radiate particle-hole pairs in the Fermi sea. A description of the system using a variational approach, based on a finite number of particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea, then becomes inappropriate around $\KK=\mathbf{0}$. We rely thus upon perturbation theory, where the small and negative parameter $\kf a\to0^-$ excludes any branches other than the monomeronic one in the ground state (as e.g.\ the dimeronic one), and allows us a systematic study of the system. We calculate the impurity self-energy $\Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$ up to second order included in $a$.

Remarkably, we obtain an analytical explicit expression for $\Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$ allowing us to study its derivatives in the plane $(K,\omega)$. These present interesting singularities, which in general appear in the third order derivatives $\partial^3 \Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$. In the special case of equal masses, $M=m$, singularities appear already in the physically more accessible second order derivatives $\partial^2 \Sigma^{(2)}(\KK,\omega)$; using a self-consistent heuristic approach based on $\Sigma^{(2)}$ we then regularise the divergence of the second order derivative $\partial\_K^2 \Delta E(\KK)$ of the complex energy of the quasi-particle found in reference [C. Trefzger, Y. Castin, Europhys. Lett. {\bf 104}, 50005 (2013)] at $K=\kf$, and we predict an interesting scaling law in the neighborhood of $K=\kf$. As a by product of our theory we have access to all moments of the momentum of the particle-hole pair emitted by the impurity while damping its motion in the Fermi sea, at the level of Fermi's golden rule.","(496, 13)","In this paper, we investigate the self-energy of an impurity in an ideal Fermi gas to second order in the interaction strength. We start by deriving the expressions for the self-energy of the impurity within the framework of the diagrammatic perturbation theory. Our results show that the self-energy of the impurity consists of two distinct terms. The first term is proportional to the square of the impurity-gas interaction strength and describes the scattering of the impurity off the Fermi sea excitations. The second term arises from the exchange of particles between the impurity and the gas and depends linearly on the interaction strength.

We then specialize to the case of a point-like impurity and a homogeneous gas. In this case, we obtain an analytic expression for the self-energy, which can be easily evaluated numerically. We show that the self-energy has a pole at a certain energy, which corresponds to the energy required to excite the impurity out of the Fermi sea. This pole can be used to extract the impurity energy and lifetime from experimental measurements.

Finally, we study the effect of the impurity-gas interaction strength on the self-energy. We find that the self-energy increases with the interaction strength, and that the higher-order terms in the perturbation theory become important at large interaction strengths. We also investigate the role of the gas temperature on the self-energy. We find that the self-energy is sensitive to the temperature, and that the higher-order terms in the perturbation theory become important at low temperatures.

In conclusion, we have shown that the self-energy of an impurity in an ideal Fermi gas to second order in the interaction strength can be computed within the framework of the diagrammatic perturbation theory. Our results provide a useful tool for the interpretation of experimental data and the understanding of impurities in Fermi gases.","(327, 15)","We study in three dimensions the problem of a spatially homogeneous zero-temperature ideal Fermi gas  perturbed by a single point-like impurity.

To tackle this problem, we employ a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. First, we use the Feynman diagrammatic approach to derive an expression for the self-energy to second order. This involves summing over all possible diagrams that contribute to the self-energy, taking into account the interactions between the impurity and the fermions. We then simplify the resulting expression using the properties of the ideal Fermi gas, such as the density of states and the Fermi-Dirac distribution function.

Next, we perform a numerical evaluation of the self-energy using a Monte Carlo method. This involves generating a large number of random configurations of the fermions and calculating the self-energy for each configuration. We then average the results over many configurations to obtain a reliable estimate of the self-energy. This approach allows us to take into account the effects of quantum fluctuations and correlations between the fermions, which are essential for an accurate calculation of the self-energy.

Our numerical results show that the self-energy exhibits a non-trivial dependence on the interaction strength and the density of the fermions. Specifically, we find that the self-energy increases with increasing interaction strength, but decreases with increasing density. This behavior can be understood by considering the effects of the impurity on the surrounding fermions.

We introduce the dependent doors problem as an abstraction for situations in which one must ","We introduce the dependent doors problem as an abstraction for situations in which one must perform a sequence of possibly dependent decisions, without receiving feedback information on the effectiveness of previously made actions.

Informally, the problem considers a set of $d$ doors that are initially closed, and the aim is to open all of them as fast as possible. To open a door, the algorithm knocks on it and it might open or not according to some probability distribution. This distribution may depend on which other doors are currently open, as well as on which other doors were open during each of the previous knocks on that door. The algorithm aims to minimize the expected time until all doors open. Crucially, it must act at any time without knowing whether or which other doors have already opened. In this work, we focus on scenarios where dependencies between doors are both positively correlated and acyclic.The fundamental distribution of a door describes the probability it opens in the best of conditions (with respect to other doors being open or closed). We show that if in two configurations of $d$ doors corresponding doors share the same fundamental distribution, then these configurations have the same optimal running time up to a universal constant, no matter what are the dependencies between doors and what are the distributions. We also identify algorithms that are optimal up to a universal constant factor. For the case in which all doors share the same fundamental distribution we additionally provide a simpler algorithm, and a formula to calculate its running time. We furthermore analyse the price of lacking feedback for several configurations governed by standard fundamental distributions. In particular, we show that the price is logarithmic in $d$ for memoryless doors, but can potentially grow to be linear in $d$ for other distributions.We then turn our attention to investigate precise bounds.

Even for the case of two doors, identifying the optimal sequence is an intriguing combinatorial question. Here, we study the case of two cascading memoryless doors. That is, the first door opens on each knock independently with probability $p\_1$. The second door can only open if the first door is open, in which case it will open on each knock independently with probability $p\_2$. We solve this problem almost completely by identifying algorithms that are optimal up to an additive term of 1.","(441, 17)","The Dependent Doors Problem (DDP) is a paradoxical puzzle that involves a series of sequential decisions made without feedback. In the DDP, a subject is presented with two doors that must be entered in order. The subject must choose which door to enter initially and the chosen door will determine the available options for the subsequent decision. If the subject chooses the ""correct"" sequence of doors, they will receive a reward, but if the sequence is ""incorrect,"" they will receive a punishment. The aim of this investigation was to understand the cognitive processes at play in decision-making for the DDP.

We conducted a series of experiments to explore the effects of different variables on DDP behavior. Our experimental design varied the number of stages in the DDP, the probability of reward and punishment, and the complexity of the task. We measured the accuracy of DDP performance, the reaction time for each decision, and the subjective experience of difficulty and confidence in decision-making. Overall, our findings suggest that participants struggle to learn the optimal strategy for the DDP. We observed a robust tendency for participants to adopt a ""stay-stay"" heuristic in which they choose the same door in both stages. This heuristic led to suboptimal decisions and lower overall accuracy.

We also found that participants were faster and more confident in their choices when they made the same decision in both stages, even if this decision was suboptimal. This preference for consistency emerged even when the feedback from the previous decision was biased or uninformative. Our data suggest that humans are biased towards consistency and simplicity, which can lead to suboptimal decisions in complex situations.

Finally, we examined the effects of cognitive load and working memory capacity on DDP performance. We found that increasing cognitive load led to decreased accuracy and slower reaction times. Our results suggest that the DDP is a complex task that requires significant cognitive resources and attentional control.

In summary, our findings shed light on the cognitive processes involved in sequential decision-making without feedback. The DDP is a challenging task that highlights the limitations of human decision-making and the potential for biases and heuristics to lead to suboptimal choices. Our results have implications for the design of decision-making tasks and suggest that interventions to improve decision-making may need to focus on training individuals to overcome biases towards consistency and simplicity.","(434, 20)","We introduce the dependent doors problem as an abstraction for situations in which one must  make sequential decisions in the absence of immediate feedback. In this scenario, an individual is presented with two doors, behind one of which is a reward, while the other conceals a penalty. The twist lies in the fact that the probability of the reward being behind each door is not fixed, but rather depends on the previous choice made by the individual. This creates a complex decision-making environment where the optimal strategy is far from obvious.

Our investigation into the dependent doors problem employed a combination of mathematical modeling and computational simulations. We developed a Markov chain model to capture the dynamics of the decision-making process, taking into account the changing probabilities of the reward's location after each choice. The model was then used to generate a large dataset of simulated trials, allowing us to analyze the behavior of different decision-making strategies under various conditions.

One of the key findings of our study is that the optimal strategy in the dependent doors problem is highly dependent on the specific structure of the probability distribution governing the reward's location. In particular, we identified three distinct regimes, each corresponding to a different level of dependence between the choices. In the first regime, the probability distribution is relatively flat, and the optimal strategy is to choose the door with the highest probability of containing the reward. In the second regime, the distribution is more skewed, and a more nuanced approach is required, involving a trade-off between the expected reward and the risk of choosing the wrong door. Finally, in the third regime, the dependence between choices is so strong that the optimal strategy involves a form of ""meta-learning,"" where the individual adapts their decision-making process based on the outcomes of previous trials.

Our results have important implications for our understanding of human decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. The dependent doors problem serves as a useful abstraction for a wide range of real-world scenarios, from financial portfolio management to medical diagnosis. By shedding light on the optimal strategies for navigating these environments, our study contributes to the development of more effective decision-making tools and techniques. Furthermore, our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between feedback and decision-making, particularly in situations where feedback is delayed or absent.

In addition to its theoretical contributions, our study also has practical applications in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. By developing algorithms that can adapt to changing probability distributions, we can improve the performance of decision-making systems in a wide range of domains. Moreover, our results provide insights into the design of more effective decision-support systems, which can help individuals make better choices in complex, uncertain environments.

In the second regime, the distribution is more skewed, and a more nuanced approach is required, involving a trade-off between the expected reward and the risk of choosing the wrong door. Finally, in the third regime, the dependence between choices is so strong that the optimal strategy involves a form of ""meta-learning,"" where the individual adapts their decision-making process based on the outcomes of previous trials.

Our results have important implications for our understanding of human decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. The dependent doors problem serves as a useful abstraction for a wide range of real-world scenarios, from financial portfolio management to medical diagnosis. By shedding light on the optimal strategies for navigating these environments, our study contributes to the development of more effective decision-making tools and techniques. Furthermore, our findings highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between feedback and decision-making, particularly in situations where feedback is delayed or absent.

In addition to its theoretical contributions, our study also has practical applications in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. By developing algorithms that can adapt to changing probability distributions, we can improve the performance of decision-making systems in a wide range of domains. Moreover, our results provide insights into the design of more effective decision-support systems, which can help individuals make better choices in complex, uncertain environments.

In","We introduce the dependent doors problem as an abstraction for situations in which one must (1) make a decision, (2) make a second decision based on the outcome of the first decision, and (3) make a third decision based on both the first and second decisions.
The dependent doors problem is an example of sequential decision-making, in which the outcome of one decision affects the outcome of a subsequent decision.
The first decision is to open or close a door.
The second decision is whether or not to open a second door based on whether or not the first door was opened.
The third decision is whether to open a third door based on the outcomes of the first two decisions.
In this example, the first door is opened, the second door is not opened, and the third door is opened.

The evolution of stars and planets is mostly controlled by the properties of their atmosphere. ","The evolution of stars and planets is mostly controlled by the properties of their atmosphere. This is particularly true in the case of exoplanets close to their stars, for which one has to account both for an (often intense) irradiation flux, and from an intrinsic flux responsible for the progressive loss of the inner planetary heat. The goals of the present work are to help understanding the coupling between radiative transfer and advection in exoplanetary atmospheres and to provide constraints on the temperatures of the deep atmospheres. This is crucial in assessing whether modifying assumed opacity sources and/or heat transport may explain the inflated sizes of a significant number of giant exoplanets found so far. I use a simple analytical approach inspired by Eddington's approximation for stellar atmospheres to derive a relation between temperature and optical depth valid for plane-parallel static grey atmospheres which are both transporting an intrinsic heat flux and receiving an outer radiation flux. The model is parameterized as a function of mean visible and thermal opacities, respectively. The model is shown to reproduce relatively well temperature profiles obtained from more sophisticated radiative transfer calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres. It naturally explains why a temperature inversion (stratosphere) appears when the opacity in the optical becomes significant compared to that in the infrared. I further show that the mean equivalent flux (proportional to T^4) is conserved in the presence of horizontal advection on constant optical depth levels. This implies with these hypotheses that the deep atmospheric temperature used as outer boundary for the evolution models should be calculated from models pertaining to the entire planetary atmosphere, not from ones that are relevant to the day side or to the substellar point. In these conditions, present-day models yield deep temperatures that are ~1000K too cold to explain the present size of planet HD 209458b. An tenfold increase in the infrared to visible opacity ratio would be required to slow the planetary cooling and contraction sufficiently to explain its size. However, the mean equivalent flux is not conserved anymore in the presence of opacity variations, or in the case of non-radiative vertical transport of energy: The presence of clouds on the night side or a downward transport of kinetic energy and its dissipation at deep levels would help making the deep atmosphere hotter and may explain the inflated sizes of giant exoplanets.","(419, 13)","This research paper delves into the topic of radiative equilibrium in planetary atmospheres that are exposed to irradiation. The study aims to provide insights into the behavior of planetary atmospheres and how they interact with their host star. An analytical solution to the radiative transfer equation has been developed to simulate the thermal behavior of some of the model exoplanetary atmospheres. 

The calculations take into account the effect of various parameterizations such as cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, and the molecular composition of the said atmospheres. Different host star types have also been taken into consideration, ranging from cool stars similar to our sun to hot stars.

One of the main findings of this research is that gas condensates and clouds can profoundly affect the temperature profiles of irradiated atmospheres. In some cases, they can lead to a temperature inversion where the upper atmosphere is significantly hotter than the layer immediately below. This effect is due to the absorption of light by the gas and the subsequent re-emission of the absorbed photons by the clouds. 

Moreover, the research has shown that the atmospheric pressure and the composition of the atmosphere can significantly affect the altitude at which this temperature inversion occurs. In some scenarios, clouds can form at much higher altitudes than the inversion layer, leading to a complex interplay of various atmospheric parameters.

Furthermore, the team has also analyzed how planetary atmospheres around different types of host stars may differ from one another. In some instances, the effects of the environmental factors can be compounded, leading to entirely different temperature profiles. The team hopes that this study will serve as a basis for further research into planetary atmosphere dynamics and help in the interpretation of current exoplanet observations.

In conclusion, this research recognizes the importance of radiative equilibrium and its effect on the behavior of planetary atmospheres that are exposed to irradiation. The analytical solution used in this study takes into account various parameterizations to simulate the thermal behavior of these atmospheres, leading to valuable insights into the atmospheric dynamics.","(367, 15)","The evolution of stars and planets is mostly controlled by the properties of their atmosphere.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of stellar irradiation on the radiative equilibrium state of planetary atmospheres.  Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the processes that govern the thermal structure of planetary atmospheres under the influence of stellar radiation.

We employ a one-dimensional radiative-convective model (1DRCM) to simulate the radiative transfer and convective processes within the planetary atmosphere.

We consider a range of stellar spectral types, from G-type main-sequence stars to M-type red dwarfs, and examine the effects of varying atmospheric compositions, including the presence of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4.

Our results show that the radiative equilibrium temperature of the planetary atmosphere is strongly dependent on the stellar irradiation flux and the atmospheric composition.  The presence of greenhouse gases leads to a significant increase in the atmospheric temperature, particularly in the lower atmosphere.  We also find that the thermal structure of the atmosphere is sensitive to the stellar spectral type, with hotter stars leading to a more pronounced temperature gradient in the upper atmosphere.

We consider an ordered pair of linear transformations A:V\to V and A*:V \to V that satisfy the following four conditions: (i) Each of A,A* is diagonalizable; (ii) there exists an ordering {V_i}_{i=0}^d of the eigenspaces of A such that A*V_i\subseteq V_{i-1}+V_i+V_{i+1} for 0\leq i\leq d, where V_{-1}=0 and V_{d+1}=0; (iii) there exists an ordering {V*_i}_{i=0}^{\delta} of the eigenspaces of A* such that AV*_i\subseteq V*_{i-1}+V*_i+V*_{i+1} for 0\leq i\leq\delta, where V*_{-1}=0 and V*_{\delta+1}=0; (iv) there does not exist a subspace W of V such that AW\subseteq W, A*W\subseteq W, W\neq0, W\neq V. We call such a pair a TD pair on V. It is known that d=\delta; to avoid trivialities assume d\geq 1. We show that there exists a unique linear transformation \Delta:V\to V such that (\Delta -I)V*_i\subseteq V*_0+V*_1+...+V*_{i-1} and \Delta(V_i+V_{i+1}+...+V_d)=V_0 +V_{1}+...+V_{d-i} for 0\leq i \leq d. We show that there exists a unique linear transformation \Psi:V\to V such that \Psi V_i\subseteq V_{i-1}+V_i+V_{i+1} and (\Psi-\Lambda)V*_i\subseteq V*_0+V*_1+...+V*_{i-2} for 0\leq i\leq d, where \Lambda=(\Delta-I)(\theta_0-\theta_d)^{-1} and \theta_0 (resp \theta_d) denotes the eigenvalue of A associated with V_0 (resp V_d). We characterize \Delta,\Psi in several ways. There are two well-known decompositions of V called the first and second split decomposition. We discuss how \Delta,\Psi act on these decompositions. We also show how \Delta,\Psi relate to each other. Along this line we have two main results. Our first main result is that \Delta,\Psi commute. In the literature on TD pairs there is a scalar \beta used to describe the eigenvalues. Our second main result is that each of \Delta^{\pm 1} is a polynomial of degree d in \Psi, under a minor assumption on \beta.","(477, 11)","The aim of this paper is to explore the properties of two commuting operators that are related to a tridiagonal pair. Our main result demonstrates that the spectral properties of these operators and the tridiagonal pair are intimately connected. We begin with a brief introduction to tridiagonal pairs and the associated Sturm-Liouville problem. Using the theory of orthogonal polynomials, we derive a set of eigenvalue equations for the two commuting operators.

A key observation is that the eigenvalues for these operators are related to the zeros of certain orthogonal polynomials. We demonstrate this connection explicitly and show that the zeros are the eigenvalues of the tridiagonal pair. Furthermore, the eigenvectors of the operators are given by corresponding columns of the associated eigenvectors of the tridiagonal matrix.

We provide several examples of the application of these results, including to differential equations with variable coefficients and to the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator. We show that our techniques yield a natural way to construct solutions to these equations and provide explicit expressions for the relevant orthogonal polynomials.

We conclude with a discussion of potential extensions of this work. One promising direction is to explore the connection to the theory of solvable models in statistical mechanics. Another is to explore the use of these operators in the context of inverse problems and signal processing.

In this paper, we extend and refine previous Tur\'an-type results on graphs with a given ","In this paper, we extend and refine previous Tur\'an-type results on graphs with a given circumference. Let $W_{n,k,c}$ be the graph obtained from a clique $K_{c-k+1}$ by adding $n-(c-k+1)$ isolated vertices each joined to the same $k$ vertices of the clique, and let $f(n,k,c)=e(W_{n,k,c})$. Improving a celebrated theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Gallai, Kopylov proved that for $c<n$, any 2-connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with circumference $c$ has at most $\max{f(n,2,c),f(n,\lfloor\frac{c}{2}\rfloor,c)}$ edges. Recently, F\""uredi et al. proved a stability version of Kopylov's theorem. Their main result states that if $G$ is a 2-connected graph on $n$ vertices with circumference $c$ such that $10\leq c<n$ and $e(G)>\max{f(n,3,c),f(n,\lfloor\frac{c}{2}\rfloor-1,c)}$, then either $G$ is a subgraph of $W_{n,2,c}$ or $W_{n,\lfloor\frac{c}{2}\rfloor,c}$, or $c$ is odd and $G$ is a subgraph of a member of two well-characterized families which we define as $\mathcal{X}_{n,c}$ and $\mathcal{Y}_{n,c}$. We prove that if $G$ is a 2-connected graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $k$ and circumference $c$ such that $10\leq c<n$ and $e(G)>\max{f(n,k+1,c),f(n,\lfloor\frac{c}{2}\rfloor-1,c)}$, then one of the following holds: (i) $G$ is a subgraph of $W_{n,k,c}$ or $W_{n,\lfloor\frac{c}{2}\rfloor,c}$, (ii) $k=2$, $c$ is odd, and $G$ is a subgraph of a member of $\mathcal{X}_{n,c}\cup \mathcal{Y}_{n,c}$, or (iii) $k\geq 3$ and $G$ is a subgraph of the union of a clique $K_{c-k+1}$ and some cliques $K_{k+1}$'s, where any two cliques share the same two vertices.

on non-Hamiltonian graphs. Moreover, we prove a stability result on a classical theorem of Bondy on the circumference.","(601, 12)","This paper explores stability results on the circumference of a graph. More specifically, we investigate how certain properties of a graph's circumference, such as its length and structure, affect its stability. Our main focus is on understanding the relationship between the circumference and the stability of a graph.

We begin by introducing some fundamental concepts related to graphs and their circumferences. We then delve into the theory of graph stability, which involves studying the balance between the number of edges and vertices in a graph. In particular, we consider the stability of graphs that have a fixed circumference length. We explore how the stability of these graphs changes as their circumference length is varied.

Our analysis reveals that there is a strong connection between the length of a graph's circumference and its stability. We show that as the circumference length grows, the stability of the graph increases as well. This result is closely linked to the notion of graph rigidity, which describes the extent to which a graph can resist deformation.

However, the relationship between circumference length and stability is not always straightforward. In some cases, we find that adding edges or vertices to a graph can increase its circumference length while decreasing its stability. This counterintuitive result highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between the different properties of a graph.

In addition to exploring the stability of graphs with fixed circumference length, we also examine the stability of graphs with varying circumference structures. Specifically, we investigate the stability of graphs with uniform and non-uniform circumference structures, and show how variations in structure can affect stability.

Overall, our analysis provides new insights into the relationship between graph circumference and stability. Our results suggest that the stability of a graph depends not only on its size and number of edges, but also on more structural properties such as its circumference length and structure. By gaining a deeper understanding of these properties, we can develop more effective algorithms for graph analysis and optimization.","(367, 18)","In this paper, we extend and refine previous Tur\'an-type results on graphs with a given 2-edge-coloring, focusing specifically on the circumference of such graphs. The circumference of a graph refers to the length of its longest cycle, and understanding its properties is crucial in various areas of graph theory, including extremal graph theory, Ramsey theory, and combinatorial design theory.

Our research question revolves around determining the minimum number of edges required to guarantee a cycle of a given length in a graph with a specific 2-edge coloring. This problem has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its connections to other fundamental problems in graph theory, such as the Hadwiger conjecture and the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture.

To address this question, we employ a combination of probabilistic and deterministic methods. First, we utilize a probabilistic approach to establish a lower bound on the number of edges needed to ensure the existence of a cycle of a certain length. This involves analyzing the expected number of cycles of the desired length in a random subgraph of the given graph, taking into account the constraints imposed by the 2-edge coloring.

Next, we develop a deterministic algorithm to construct a subgraph with a guaranteed cycle of the specified length. This algorithm is based on a careful selection of edges from the original graph, ensuring that the resulting subgraph satisfies the necessary conditions for containing a cycle of the desired length. We also provide a detailed analysis of the time complexity of this algorithm, demonstrating its efficiency in practice.

One of the key contributions of this paper is the introduction of a new graph parameter, which we call the ""colorful cycle number."" This parameter captures the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of a graph such that every cycle has at least one edge of each color. We show that this parameter is closely related to the circumference of the graph and provide upper and lower bounds on its value in terms of the graph's order and size.

Our main result is a stability theorem, which states that if a graph has a 2-edge coloring with a small colorful cycle number, then it must have a cycle of length at least a certain fraction of its order. This theorem has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the relationship between the colorful cycle number and the circumference of graphs. Specifically, it implies that graphs with small colorful cycle numbers are likely to have large cycles, and vice versa.

The implications of our results are multifaceted. On the one hand, they provide new insights into the structure of graphs with specific 2-edge colorings, shedding light on the relationships between different graph parameters.

This algorithm is based on a careful selection of edges from the original graph, ensuring that the resulting subgraph satisfies the necessary conditions for containing a cycle of the desired length. We also provide a detailed analysis of the time complexity of this algorithm, demonstrating its efficiency in practice.

One of the key contributions of this paper is the introduction of a new graph parameter, which we call the ""colorful cycle number."" This parameter captures the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of a graph such that every cycle has at least one edge of each color. We show that this parameter is closely related to the circumference of the graph and provide upper and lower bounds on its value in terms of the graph's order and size.

Our main result is a stability theorem, which states that if a graph has a 2-edge coloring with a small colorful cycle number, then it must have a cycle of length at least a certain fraction of its order. This theorem has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the relationship between the colorful cycle number and the circumference of graphs. Specifically, it implies that graphs with small colorful cycle numbers are likely to have large cycles, and vice versa.

The implications of our results are multifaceted. On the one hand, they provide new insights into the structure of graphs with specific 2-edge colorings, shedding light on the relationships between different graph parameters. On the other hand,","In this paper, we extend and refine previous Tur\'an-type results on graphs with a given $k$-circumference.
We show that if $G$ is a graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and $k$ vertices on the circumference, then $m \leq \frac{n}{k} + 1$.
We also show that if a graph $G = (V, E)$ has $n = |V|$ vertices and $m=|E|$ edges, then $\frac{|V|}{|E|} \leq m \leq n - 1$, where $|V| = \sum_{v \in V} |E(v)|$ and $|E| = E(V) - E(V \setminus V)$ is the number of edges in $G$.

Context: Actor-based programming languages offer many essential features for developing modern distributed reactive systems. These ","Context: Actor-based programming languages offer many essential features for developing modern distributed reactive systems. These systems exploit the actor model's isolation property to fulfill their performance and scalability demands. Unfortunately, the reliance of the model on isolation as its most fundamental property requires programmers to express complex interaction patterns between their actors to be expressed manually in terms of complex combinations of messages sent between the isolated actors.

Inquiry: In the last three decades, several language design proposals have been introduced to reduce the complexity that emerges from describing said interaction and coordination of actors. We argue that none of these proposals is satisfactory in order to express the many complex interaction patterns between actors found in modern reactive distributed systems.

Approach: We describe seven smart home automation scenarios (in which an actor represents every smart home appliance) to motivate the support by actor languages for five radically different types of message synchronization patterns, which are lacking in modern distributed actor-based languages.

Fortunately, these five types of synchronisation patterns have been studied extensively by the Complex Event Processing (CEP) community. Our paper describes how such CEP patterns are elegantly added to an actor-based programming language.

Knowledge: Based on our findings, we propose an extension of the single-message matching paradigm of contemporary actor-based languages in order to support a multiple-message matching way of thinking in the same way as proposed by CEP languages. Our proposal thus enriches the actor-model by ways of declaratively describing complex message combinations to which an actor can respond.

Grounding: We base the problem-statement of the paper on an online poll in the home automation community that has motivated the real need for the CEP-based synchronisation operators between actors proposed in the paper.

Furthermore, we implemented a DSL -- called Sparrow -- that supports said operators and we argue quantitatively (in terms of LOC and in terms of a reduction of the concerns that have to be handled by programmers) that the DSL outperforms existing approaches.

Importance: This work aims to provide a set of synchronization operators that help actor-based languages to handle the complex interaction required by modern reactive distributed systems. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first one to add advanced CEP synchronization operators to the -- relatively simplistic single-message based matching -- mechanisms of most actor-based languages.","(421, 14)","The actor model is a popular concurrency model that provides a scalable and fault-tolerant way of building concurrent systems. Join patterns, based on message-passing, facilitate the coordination and interaction between actors. However, existing join pattern implementations in the actor model are limited in scope and functionality. 

In this paper, we present advanced join patterns for the actor model based on complex event processing (CEP) techniques. Our approach extends the capabilities of join patterns by allowing them to handle complex event matching in addition to message passing. 

We propose a syntax for defining advanced join patterns that combines both event patterns and message patterns. Our implementation supports operators for filtering, aggregation, and temporal relations. Additionally, we describe a pattern-matching algorithm that efficiently processes join patterns by exploiting the concurrency properties of the actor model.

We evaluate the performance of our approach against existing join pattern implementations. Our results show that our approach performs significantly better than existing solutions in scenarios that require CEP capabilities. In addition, our approach scales well and is capable of handling large volumes of messages and events.

Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach through two case studies. The first case study involves the implementation of a real-time monitoring system for IoT devices. The second case study focuses on the design of a distributed system for tracking and analyzing financial transactions. In both cases, our approach enables the implementation of sophisticated coordination and interaction patterns that would not be possible with standard join pattern implementations.

It provides a powerful tool for building sophisticated and scalable concurrent systems.","(310, 17)","Context: Actor-based programming languages offer many essential features for developing modern distributed reactive systems.

In the free three-dimensional space, we consider a pair of identical $\uparrow$ fermions of some ","In the free three-dimensional space, we consider a pair of identical $\uparrow$ fermions of some species or in some internal state, and a pair of identical $\downarrow$ fermions of another species or in another state. There is a resonant $s$-wave interaction (that is of zero range and infinite scattering length) between fermions in different pairs, and no interaction within the same pair. We study whether this $2+2$ fermionic system can exhibit (as the $3+1$ fermionic system) a four-body Efimov effect in the absence of three-body Efimov effect, that is the mass ratio $\alpha$ between $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ fermions and its inverse are both smaller than 13.6069{\ldots}. For this purpose, we investigate scale invariant zero-energy solutions of the four-body Schr\""odinger equation, that is positively homogeneous functions of the coordinates of degree {$s-7/2$}, where $s$ is a generalized Efimov exponent {that becomes purely imaginary in the presence of a four-body Efimov effect.} Using rotational invariance in momentum space, it is found that the allowed values of $s$ are such that $M(s)$ has a zero eigenvalue; here the operator $M(s)$, that depends on the total angular momentum $\ell$, acts on functions of two real variables (the cosine of the angle between two wave vectors and the logarithm of the ratio of their moduli), and we write it explicitly in terms of an integral matrix kernel. We have performed a spectral analysis of $M(s)$, analytical and for an arbitrary imaginary $s$ for the continuous spectrum, numerical and limited to $s = 0$ and $\ell \le 12$ for the discrete spectrum. We conclude that no eigenvalue of $M(0)$ crosses zero over the mass ratio interval $\alpha \in [1, 13.6069\ldots]$, even if, in the parity sector $(-1)^{\ell}$, the continuous spectrum of $M(s)$ has everywhere a zero lower border. As a consequence, there is no possibility of a four-body Efimov effect for the 2+2 fermions. We also enunciated a conjecture for the fourth virial coefficient of the unitary spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas,inspired from the known analytical form of the third cluster coefficient and involving the integral over the imaginary $s$-axis of $s$ times the logarithmic derivative of the determinant of $M(s)$ summed over all angular momenta.The conjectured value is in contradiction with the experimental results.","(493, 9)","This paper aims to explore the potential existence of a four-body Efimov effect in the 2 + 2 fermionic problem. The four-body Efimov effect refers to a phenomenon where the quantum mechanical interactions between three particles can lead to an infinite number of bound states. While much research has been conducted on the three-body Efimov effect, little has been done to study its four-body counterpart. Therefore, we used numerical techniques to explore this possibility.

Our results indicate that the four-body Efimov effect is not present in the 2 + 2 fermionic system. We found that, while the three-body Efimov effect is indeed present, the addition of a fourth particle leads to a breakdown of this phenomenon. This result is in contrast to previous theoretical predictions, which suggested the presence of a four-body Efimov effect.

We also investigated the conditions under which the four-body Efimov effect could potentially exist. Our analysis indicates that the probability of this phenomenon occurring decreases as the range of the two-body interaction potential increases. This finding suggests that the presence of a four-body Efimov effect in a real-world system may be unlikely.

Our study has important implications for the field of few-body quantum mechanics. The absence of a four-body Efimov effect in the 2 + 2 fermionic system highlights the importance of understanding the full dynamics of few-body systems. It also provides insight into the limitations of current theoretical models and the need for more sophisticated techniques to explore complex quantum mechanical phenomena.

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the absence of a four-body Efimov effect in the 2 + 2 fermionic problem. This result highlights the importance of investigating the full dynamics of few-body systems, and provides valuable insight into the limitations of current theoretical models. Future research should continue to explore the potential existence of the four-body Efimov effect in more complex systems and under different conditions.","(335, 16)","In the free three-dimensional space, we consider a pair of identical $\uparrow$ fermions of some  mass $m_1$ and another pair of identical $\downarrow$ fermions with mass $m_2$, where $m_1 \neq m_2$. Our primary objective is to investigate the possibility of a four-fermion Efimov effect arising from the interaction between these two pairs of fermions. The Efimov effect is a well-documented phenomenon that describes the existence of an infinite number of weakly bound trimers in a system of three identical bosons or fermions interacting via a short-range potential. However, the extension of this effect to four-body systems has been a subject of ongoing research and debate.

To address this question, we employ a combination of analytical and numerical methods. First, we utilize the Faddeev-Yakubovsky (FY) equations, which are a set of coupled integro-differential equations that describe the scattering and bound-state properties of a four-body system. These equations are derived from the Schrödinger equation and provide a powerful tool for studying the low-energy behavior of four-body systems. We solve the FY equations using a numerical approach, which involves discretizing the integral equations and solving the resulting system of linear equations. This method allows us to obtain accurate results for the binding energies and wave functions of the four-body system.

Our numerical calculations are performed for a wide range of two-body interactions, including both attractive and repulsive potentials. We also vary the mass ratio $m_1/m_2$ to explore its impact on the four-body spectrum. By analyzing the results, we find that the four-body system does not exhibit the characteristic features of an Efimov effect, such as an infinite number of bound states or a specific scaling behavior of the binding energies. Instead, we observe a finite number of bound states, which are determined by the two-body interactions and the mass ratio.

Our findings have significant implications for the understanding of four-body systems and the Efimov effect. They suggest that the Efimov phenomenon is not a universal feature of four-body systems, but rather a unique property of three-body systems. This result has important consequences for the interpretation of experimental data and the development of theoretical models for four-body systems. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of considering the mass ratio and two-body interactions in four-body systems, as these factors play a crucial role in determining the binding properties of the system.

In addition to the numerical results, we also provide an analytical treatment of the four-body problem using the hyperspherical harmonics (HH) method.","(458, 18)","In the free three-dimensional space, we consider a pair of identical $\uparrow$ fermions of some (but not necessarily the same) mass $m$.

These equations are derived from the Schrödinger equation and provide a powerful tool for studying the low-energy behavior of four-body systems. We solve the FY equations using a numerical approach, which involves discretizing the integral equations and solving the resulting system of linear equations. This method allows us to obtain accurate results for the binding energies and wave functions of the four-body system.

Our numerical calculations are performed for a wide range of two-body interactions, including both attractive and repulsive potentials. We also vary the mass ratio $m_1/m_2$ to explore its impact on the four-body spectrum. By analyzing the results, we find that the four-body system does not exhibit the characteristic features of an Efimov effect, such as an infinite number of bound states or a specific scaling behavior of the binding energies. Instead, we observe a finite number of bound states, which are determined by the two-body interactions and the mass ratio.

Our findings have significant implications for the understanding of four-body systems and the Efimov effect. They suggest that the Efimov phenomenon is not a universal feature of four-body systems, but rather a unique property of three-body systems. This result has important consequences for the interpretation of experimental data and the development of theoretical models for four-body systems. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of considering the mass ratio and two-body interactions in four-body systems, as these factors play a crucial role in determining the binding properties of the system.

In addition to the numerical results, we also provide an analytical treatment of the four-body problem using the hyperspherical harmonics (HH) method.","In the free three-dimensional space, we consider a pair of identical $\uparrow$ fermions of some (but not necessarily the same) mass $m$.
The two fermions are separated by a distance $r$ and are initially in the ground state.
The interaction between the fermions is described by the following Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}
H = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} \left( \frac{\vec{p}_i \cdot \vec{p_j}}{r} \right)^2
\label{eq:hamiltonian}
\end{equation}$$
where $\vec{p}_{i}$ is the momentum of fermion $i$ and $m$ is the mass of the fermions.
The Hamiltonian $H$ is symmetric under interchange of the two fermions, i.e. $H = H^\dagger$.
We are interested in the ground-state energy $E_0$ of the system as a function of $r$.
In the limit $r \to 0$, the Hamiltonian reduces to the free-fermion Hamiltonian, which is known to exhibit the Efimov four-body effect.
In this limit, the ground state energy of the system is given by:

This extended abstract presents a logic, called Lp, that is capable of representing and reasoning ","This extended abstract presents a logic, called Lp, that is capable of representing and reasoning with a wide variety of both qualitative and quantitative statistical information. The advantage of this logical formalism is that it offers a declarative representation of statistical knowledge; knowledge represented in this manner can be used for a variety of reasoning tasks. The logic differs from previous work in probability logics in that it uses a probability distribution over the domain of discourse, whereas most previous work (e.g., Nilsson [2], Scott et al. [3], Gaifinan [4], Fagin et al.

[5]) has investigated the attachment of probabilities to the sentences of the logic (also, see Halpern [6] and Bacchus [7] for further discussion of the differences). The logic Lp possesses some further important features. First, Lp is a superset of first order logic, hence it can represent ordinary logical assertions. This means that Lp provides a mechanism for integrating statistical information and reasoning about uncertainty into systems based solely on logic.

Second, Lp possesses transparent semantics, based on sets and probabilities of those sets. Hence, knowledge represented in Lp can be understood in terms of the simple primative concepts of sets and probabilities. And finally, the there is a sound proof theory that has wide coverage (the proof theory is complete for certain classes of models). The proof theory captures a sufficient range of valid inferences to subsume most previous probabilistic uncertainty reasoning systems. For example, the linear constraints like those generated by Nilsson's probabilistic entailment [2] can be generated by the proof theory, and the Bayesian inference underlying belief nets [8] can be performed. In addition, the proof theory integrates quantitative and qualitative reasoning as well as statistical and logical reasoning. In the next section we briefly examine previous work in probability logics, comparing it to Lp. Then we present some of the varieties of statistical information that Lp is capable of expressing.

After this we present, briefly, the syntax, semantics, and proof theory of the logic. We conclude with a few examples of knowledge representation and reasoning in Lp, pointing out the advantages of the declarative representation offered by Lp. We close with a brief discussion of probabilities as degrees of belief, indicating how such probabilities can be generated from statistical knowledge encoded in Lp. The reader who is interested in a more complete treatment should consult Bacchus [7].","(464, 20)","In the context of decision making, uncertainty and imprecision are often present when dealing with statistical information. Lp, a logic for statistical information, has been developed to address these issues. In this paper, we provide an overview of the key features and benefits of Lp and highlight its suitability for decision making processes in a variety of domains.

One of the key strengths of Lp is its ability to represent and reason with both uncertain and imprecise information. This is achieved through its unique approach to probabilistic reasoning, which utilizes the mathematical theory of fuzzy sets. As a result, Lp is well-suited for situations where information is incomplete or vague, and supports the integration of evidence from multiple sources.

Another notable feature of Lp is its ability to handle logical contradictions that may arise when working with statistical information. Unlike other approaches that may simply ignore or eliminate contradictory information, Lp uses a paraconsistent logic to reason about inconsistencies in a principled way. This ensures that all available information is taken into account, even if it appears contradictory at first glance.

Lp is also designed to be computationally efficient, making it applicable to a broad range of real-world decision-making scenarios. This is achieved through the use of various techniques, such as approximation and optimization methods, that enable it to handle large-scale problems in a tractable and scalable manner.

Finally, we discuss several applications of Lp in diverse domains, showcasing its value in practice. Examples include its use in medical diagnosis, portfolio management, and environmental risk assessment. In each of these applications, Lp has demonstrated its ability to handle complex statistical information while providing decision support that is both interpretable and robust.

In summary, Lp is a logic for statistical information that provides a powerful framework for reasoning under uncertainty and imprecision. Its unique approach to probabilistic reasoning, paraconsistent logic, and computational efficiency make it well-suited for a wide range of real-world decision-making scenarios. Through its applications in various domains, Lp has demonstrated its value as a practical tool for decision support.","(379, 17)","This extended abstract presents a logic, called Lp, that is capable of representing and reasoning  about statistical information in a rigorous and expressive manner.

The Riemann $\Xi(z)$ function (even in $z$) admits a Fourier transform of an even kernel ","The Riemann $\Xi(z)$ function (even in $z$) admits a Fourier transform of an even kernel $\Phi(t)=4e^{9t/2}\theta''(e^{2t})+6e^{5t/2}\theta'(e^{2t})$. Here $\theta(x):=\theta_3(0,ix)$ and $\theta_3(0,z)$ is a Jacobi theta function, a modular form of weight $\frac{1}{2}$. (A) We discover a family of functions $\{\Phi_n(t)\}_{n\geqslant 2}$ whose Fourier transform on compact support $(-\frac{1}{2}\log n, \frac{1}{2}\log n)$, $\{F(n,z)\}_{n\geqslant2}$, converges to $\Xi(z)$ uniformly in the critical strip $S_{1/2}:=\{|\Im(z)|< \frac{1}{2}\}$. (B) Based on this we then construct another family of functions $\{H(14,n,z)\}_{n\geqslant 2}$ and show that it uniformly converges to $\Xi(z)$ in the critical strip $S_{1/2}$. (C) Based on this we construct another family of functions $\{W(n,z)\}_{n\geqslant 8}:=\{H(14,n,2z/\log n)\}_{n\geqslant 8}$ and show that if all the zeros of $\{W(n,z)\}_{n\geqslant 8}$ in the critical strip $S_{1/2}$ are real, then all the zeros of $\{H(14,n,z)\}_{n\geqslant 8}$ in the critical strip $S_{1/2}$ are real. (D) We then show that $W(n,z)=U(n,z)-V(n,z)$ and $U(n,z^{1/2})$ and $V(n,z^{1/2})$ have only real, positive and simple zeros. And there exists a positive integer $N\geqslant 8$ such that for all $n\geqslant N$, the zeros of $U(n,x^{1/2})$ are strictly left-interlacing with those of $V(n,x^{1/2})$. Using an entire function equivalent to Hermite-Kakeya Theorem for polynomials we show that $W(n\geqslant N,z^{1/2})$ has only real, positive and simple zeros. Thus $W(n\geqslant N,z)$ have only real and imple zeros. (E) Using a corollary of Hurwitz's theorem in complex analysis we prove that $\Xi(z)$ has no zeros in $S_{1/2}\setminus\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $S_{1/2}\setminus \mathbb{R}$ is a zero-free region for $\Xi(z)$. Since all the zeros of $\Xi(z)$ are in $S_{1/2}$, all the zeros of $\Xi(z)$ are in $\mathbb{R}$, i.e., all the zeros of $\Xi(z)$ are real.","(663, 11)","The Riemann zeta function, denoted as $\zeta(z)$, is one of the most essential functions in mathematics, and its properties have been studied for centuries. It is known that $\zeta(z)$ has non-trivial zeros, which lie on the critical line $\Re(z)=\frac{1}{2}$. Another function that is closely related to $\zeta(z)$ is the Riemann $\Xi(z)$ function, which is defined as the derivative of the logarithm of the Riemann zeta function.

The zeros of the Riemann $\Xi(z)$ function are closely tied to those of the Riemann zeta function, as they correspond to the critical points of the zeta function. In this paper, we investigate the properties of the zeros of the Riemann $\Xi(z)$ function and their relationship to the Riemann zeta function.

One of the most important results that we obtain is a formula for the number of zeros of the Riemann $\Xi(z)$ function that lie on a given vertical line in the complex plane. Our formula is expressed in terms of the values of the Riemann zeta function and the Hurwitz zeta function, which are closely related to each other. We also derive other formulas that give us a better understanding of the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann $\Xi(z)$ function.

Moreover, we investigate the behavior of the zeros of the Riemann $\Xi(z)$ function near the critical line $\Re(z)=\frac{1}{2}$. We show that the zeros exhibit a critical slowing down as they approach the critical line, which is a phenomenon known in physics as a 'critical point'. We also investigate the possible existence of zeros on the critical line and establish a lower bound for the number of zeros on the critical line.

Our results provide significant insight into the properties of the Riemann zeta function and its related functions. They shed light on the behavior of the non-trivial zeros of these functions and their connection to number theory and physics. The analysis presented in this paper has applications in a variety of fields, from cryptography to quantum mechanics. Overall, this is an important contribution to the ongoing study of the Riemann $\Xi(z)$ function and its zeros.","(445, 15)","The Riemann $\Xi(z)$ function (even in $z$) admits a Fourier transform of an even kernel  $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} e^{-\pi n^2 z^2}.$

Our primary goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic behavior of these zeros as the imaginary part of $z$ tends to infinity.
To achieve this, we employ a combination of techniques from complex analysis, harmonic analysis, and number theory.

We begin by expressing $\Xi(z)$ in terms of its Mellin transform, which allows us to derive an integral representation of the function.
This representation enables us to apply the Paley-Wiener theorem, a fundamental result in harmonic analysis, to establish a bound on the growth rate of the function.
Specifically, we show that $\Xi(z)$ grows at most like $e^{\pi z^2}$ as $\text{Im}(z) \to \infty.$
This bound is crucial in our subsequent analysis, as it enables us to control the growth of the function and thereby establish the existence of zeros on the critical line.

Next, we utilize the Hadamard product formula to express $\Xi(z)$ as an infinite product over its zeros.
This formula provides a powerful tool for analyzing the distribution of zeros, as it allows us to study the properties of the individual factors in the product.
We then apply the Jensen's formula, a result from complex analysis, to derive an asymptotic estimate for the number of zeros in a given rectangle in the complex plane.
This estimate enables us to establish a lower bound on the density of zeros along the critical line, which is a key ingredient in our subsequent analysis.

Building on these results, we introduce a new function, denoted by $\Psi(z),$ which is closely related to $\Xi(z)$ and plays a central role in our analysis.
We show that $\Psi(z)$ has a similar growth rate to $\Xi(z),$ and that its zeros are also distributed along the critical line.

Simplified silica (Zeosil 1165 MP) and SBR (140k carrying silanol end-groups) nanocomposites have been formulated ","Simplified silica (Zeosil 1165 MP) and SBR (140k carrying silanol end-groups) nanocomposites have been formulated by mixing of a reduced number of ingredients with respect to industrial applications. The thermo-mechanical history of the samples during the mixing process was monitored and adjusted to identical final temperatures. The filler structure on large scales up to micrometers was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and very small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). A complete quantitative model extending from the primary silica nanoparticle (of radius \approx 10 nm), to nanoparticles aggregates, up to micrometer-sized branches with typical lateral dimension of 150 nm is proposed. Image analysis of the TEM-pictures yields the fraction of zones of pure polymer, which extend between the branches of a large-scale filler network. This network is compatible with a fractal of average dimension 2.4 as measured by scattering. On smaller length scales, inside the branches, small silica aggregates are present. Their average radius has been deduced from a Kratky analysis, and it ranges between 35 and 40 nm for all silica fractions investigated here (\phi_si = 8-21% vol.). A central piece of our analysis is the description of the interaggregate interaction by a simulated structure factor for polydisperse spheres representing aggregates. A polydispersity of 30% in aggregate size is assumed, and interactions between these aggregates are described with a hard core repulsive potential. The same distribution in size is used to evaluate the polydisperse form factor.

Comparison with the experimental intensity leads to the determination of the average aggregate compacity (assumed identical for all aggregates in the distribution, between 31% and 38% depending on \phi_si), and thus aggregation number (ca. 45, with a large spread). Because of the effect of aggregate compacity and of pure polymer zones, the volume fraction of aggregates is higher in the branches than \phi_si. The repulsion between aggregates has a strong effect on the apparent isothermal compressibility: it leads to a characteristic low-q depression, which cannot be interpreted as aggregate mass decrease in our data. In addition, the reinforcement effect of these silica structures in the SBR-matrix is characterized with oscillatory shear and described with a model based on the same aggregate compacity. Finally, our results show that it is possible to analyze the complex structure of interacting aggregates in nanocomposites of industrial origin in a self-consistent and quantitative manner.","(437, 17)","This study investigates the multiscale filler structure in simplified industrial nanocomposite silica/styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) systems using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The filler structure is known to greatly affect the resulting properties of rubber composites, making it crucial to understand its organization at various length scales. 

Through SAXS experiments, we were able to observe the evolution of filler structures over a range of length scales, revealing both hierarchical and fractal features. In particular, we observed the formation of a silica network at the microscale and fractal aggregates at the nanoscale. Additionally, TEM analysis was used to provide a more detailed look at the filler structure at the nanoscale. 

Our results suggest that the filler structures in our simplified industrial nanocomposites depend on several factors, including the mixing conditions, filler concentration, and the presence of other additives. The hierarchical and fractal features also appear to be linked to the viscoelastic properties of the rubber composites. 

Further analysis of the SAXS and TEM data revealed a number of interesting findings. Notably, the presence of dispersed nanofillers in the rubber matrix was found to increase the crosslink density of the rubber, leading to enhanced mechanical properties. We also observed the role of surfactants, which can influence the organization of the filler structure, and the impact of filler-filler interactions on the final structure. 

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the importance of understanding the multiscale filler structure in simplified industrial nanocomposite silica/SBR systems.

The primary objective of this research is to elucidate the structural characteristics of these nanocomposites at various length scales, which is crucial for understanding their mechanical and thermal properties.

The nanocomposites were prepared using a solvent-based method, where the silica particles were dispersed in a solution of SBR in toluene. The mixture was then cast onto a glass substrate and allowed to dry under ambient conditions. The resulting films were characterized using SAXS and TEM to investigate the filler structure at different length scales.

SAXS measurements revealed that the silica particles exhibit a broad size distribution, ranging from 10 to 100 nm in diameter. The particle size distribution was found to be bimodal, indicating the presence of two distinct populations of particles. The larger particles, with diameters greater than 50 nm, were found to be agglomerated, while the smaller particles were well-dispersed within the SBR matrix.

TEM images provided further insight into the filler structure at the nanoscale. The images showed that the silica particles are not only agglomerated but also exhibit a high degree of surface roughness. The surface roughness was found to be more pronounced for the larger particles, which is consistent with the SAXS results. Additionally, the TEM images revealed the presence of a thin layer of SBR coating on the surface of the silica particles, which is believed to be responsible for the improved dispersion of the particles within the matrix.

The SAXS and TEM results were used to develop a multiscale model of the filler structure, which takes into account the particle size distribution, agglomeration, surface roughness, and SBR coating.

The nanocomposites were prepared using a solvent-based method, where the silica particles were dispersed in a solution of SBR in toluene. The mixture was then cast onto a glass substrate and allowed to dry under ambient conditions. The resulting films were characterized using SAXS and TEM to investigate the filler structure at different length scales.

SAXS measurements revealed that the silica particles exhibit a broad size distribution, ranging from 10 to 100 nm in diameter. The particle size distribution was found to be bimodal, indicating the presence of two distinct populations of particles. The larger particles, with diameters greater than 50 nm, were found to be agglomerated, while the smaller particles were well-dispersed within the SBR matrix.

TEM images provided further insight into the filler structure at the nanoscale. The images showed that the silica particles are not only agglomerated but also exhibit a high degree of surface roughness. The surface roughness was found to be more pronounced for the larger particles, which is consistent with the SAXS results. Additionally, the TEM images revealed the presence of a thin layer of SBR coating on the surface of the silica particles, which is believed to be responsible for the improved dispersion of the particles within the matrix.

We study the Landau-gauge Gribov ghost form-factor sigma(p^2) for SU(N) Yang-Mills theories in the d-dimensional ","We study the Landau-gauge Gribov ghost form-factor sigma(p^2) for SU(N) Yang-Mills theories in the d-dimensional case. We find a qualitatively different behavior for d=3,4 w.r.t. d=2. In particular, considering any (sufficiently regular) gluon propagator D(p^2) and the one-loop-corrected ghost propagator G(p^2), we prove in the 2d case that sigma(p^2) blows up in the infrared limit p -> 0 as -D(0)\ln(p^2). Thus, for d=2, the no-pole condition \sigma(p^2) < 1 (for p^2 > 0) can be satisfied only if D(0) = 0. On the contrary, in d=3 and 4, sigma(p^2) is finite also if D(0) > 0. The same results are obtained by evaluating G(p^2) explicitly at one loop, using fitting forms for D(p^2) that describe well the numerical data of D(p^2) in d=2,3,4 in the SU(2) case. These evaluations also show that, if one considers the coupling constant g^2 as a free parameter, G(p^2) admits a one-parameter family of behaviors (labelled by g^2), in agreement with Boucaud et al. In this case the condition sigma(0) <= 1 implies g^2 <= g^2_c, where g^2_c is a 'critical' value. Moreover, a free-like G(p^2) in the infrared limit is obtained for any value of g^2 < g^2_c, while for g^2 = g^2_c one finds an infrared-enhanced G(p^2). Finally, we analyze the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) for sigma(p^2) and show that, for infrared-finite ghost-gluon vertices, one can bound sigma(p^2). Using these bounds we find again that only in the d=2 case does one need to impose D(0) = 0 in order to satisfy the no-pole condition. The d=2 result is also supported by an analysis of the DSE using a spectral representation for G(p^2). Thus, if the no-pole condition is imposed, solving the d=2 DSE cannot lead to a massive behavior for D(p^2). These results apply to any Gribov copy inside the so-called first Gribov horizon, i.e. the 2d result D(0) = 0 is not affected by Gribov noise. These findings are also in agreement with lattice data.","(448, 17)","In this paper, we investigate the properties of the Gribov ghost form factor in the context of the no-pole condition in Landau gauge. Our results show that the form factor exhibits non-analytic behavior at zero momentum, giving rise to a constraint on the two-dimensional gluon propagator. We derive this constraint through a careful analysis of the ghost form factor in the infrared region, where it is found to diverge and exhibit a power-law behavior. We show that this divergence is related to the no-pole condition in Landau gauge and discuss its implications for the renormalization of the two-dimensional gluon propagator.

We also investigate the behavior of the ghost form factor at finite momentum and find that it exhibits a resonance-like structure, which we interpret as a manifestation of the transverse modes of the gluon field. We analyze this resonance structure in detail and show that it is related to the value of the ghost-gluon vertex at zero momentum. We argue that the properties of the ghost form factor and the no-pole condition provide important insights into the nature of the infrared dynamics of Yang-Mills theory in Landau gauge.

Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the non-perturbative functional renormalization group approach to Yang-Mills theory in the infrared limit. We argue that the no-pole condition and the associated properties of the Gribov ghost form factor provide important constraints on the non-perturbative flow of the theory and may help to shed light on the nature of the confinement mechanism.

In summary, our work has shed light on the no-pole condition in Landau gauge and its implications for the Gribov ghost form factor and the two-dimensional gluon propagator.

This condition has significant implications for the behavior of the gluon propagator in the infrared regime.

To address this problem, we employ a combination of analytical and numerical methods. First, we derive an exact expression for the ghost form-factor in terms of the eigenvalues of the Faddeev-Popov operator. We then use this expression to analyze the behavior of the form-factor under the NPC constraint. Our analysis reveals that the NPC imposes a non-trivial constraint on the ghost form-factor, leading to a suppression of the form-factor at small momenta.

We also investigate the implications of the NPC for the 2d gluon propagator. Our results indicate that the NPC constraint leads to a significant reduction in the gluon dressing function at small momenta, resulting in a more rapid approach to the free-field limit. This finding has important implications for our understanding of the infrared behavior of Yang-Mills theories.

Furthermore, we explore the connection between the NPC and the existence of a mass gap in the theory.

Core helium burning is the dominant source of energy of extreme horizontal branch stars, as ","Core helium burning is the dominant source of energy of extreme horizontal branch stars, as the hydrogen envelope is too small to contribute to the nuclear energy output. The evolution of each mass in the HR diagram occurs along vertical tracks that, when the core helium is consumed, evolve to higher Teff and then to the white dwarf stage. The larger is the mass, the smaller is the Teff of the models, so that the zero age horizontal branch (ZAHB) is ""horizontal"". In this paper we show that, if the helium mass fraction (Y) of the envelope is larger than Y~0.5, the shape of the tracks changes completely: the hydrogen burning becomes efficient again also for very small envelope masses, thanks to the higher molecular weight and to the higher temperatures of the hydrogen shell. The larger is Y, the smaller is the envelope mass that provides strong H-shell burning. These tracks have a curled shape, are located at a Teff following the approximate relation Teff=8090+ 32900xY, and become more luminous for larger envelope masses. Consequently, the ZAHB of the very high helium models is ""vertical"" in the HR diagram. Synthetic models based on these tracks nicely reproduce the location and shape of the ""blue hook"" in the globular cluster wCen, best fit by a very high Teff (bluer) sequence with Y=0.80 and a cooler (redder) one with Y=0.65. Although these precise values of Y may depend on the color-Teff conversions, we know that the helium content of the progenitors of the blue hook stars can not be larger than Y~0.38-0.40, if they are descendants of the cluster blue main sequence. Consequently, this interpretation implies that all these objects must in fact be progeny of the blue main sequence, but they have all suffered further deep mixing, that has largely and uniformly increased their surface helium abundance, during the red giant branch evolution. A late helium flash can not be the cause of this deep mixing, as the models we propose have hydrogen rich envelopes much more massive than those required for a late flash. We discuss different models of deep mixing proposed in the literature, and conclude that our interpretation of the blue hook can not be ruled out, but requires a much deeper investigation before it can be accepted.","(430, 12)","Omega Centauri is a massive globular cluster in the Milky Way galaxy, hosting a myriad of interesting phenomena waiting to be explored. Among these phenomena, the blue hook stars represent a unique population, known for their distinct evolutionary properties and still subject to intense study. This paper aims to investigate the evolutionary status of the blue hook stars in Omega Centauri, shedding light on their origins and subsequent evolution.

By making use of several spectroscopic techniques, we have analyzed a sample of blue hook stars in Omega Centauri to extract their detailed chemical makeup and crucial astrophysical parameters such as age, mass, and luminosity. Our results show that the majority of blue hook stars in Omega Centauri are formed through the binary star mass transfer mechanism, while a small fraction is a result of the merger of two low-mass stars. This finding challenges the traditional paradigm that suggests that these stars are formed via a direct and single stellar evolution channel.

Moreover, our results reveal that the blue hook stars' chemical patterns differ from those of the Main Sequence stars, indicating that they originate from a different stellar population. Additionally, we find that the blue hook stars exhibit a considerably low oxygen abundance, which contradicts the higher values expected for stars of similar age and mass. This discrepancy may be a direct connection to the blue hook stars' peculiar evolutionary pathways and the impact of binary interactions on their chemical enrichment history.

In terms of their evolutionary status, our investigation suggests that the majority of blue hook stars in Omega Centauri have evolved off the Main Sequence stage, ending up in a state of helium core burning or are on the verge of it. These states correspond to specific phases of stellar evolution, characterized by a range of observable features that could help identify these stars in future studies.

Using a combination of archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, we have compiled a sample of 25 blue hook stars within Omega Centauri, along with a control sample of 50 extreme horizontal branch stars. The photometric properties of these stars were analyzed using the DAOPHOT package, while spectroscopic data were obtained using the X-Shooter spectrograph.

We find that blue hook stars are characterized by lower luminosities, higher temperatures, and lower surface gravities than their extreme horizontal branch counterparts. These differences are statistically significant, with p-values < 0.01 for all three parameters. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that blue hook stars may be experiencing enhanced mass loss due to strong stellar winds, which could be responsible for their observed properties.

A fundamental problem in analysis is to decide whether a smooth solution exists for the ","A fundamental problem in analysis is to decide whether a smooth solution exists for the Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions. In this paper we shall study this problem. The Navier-Stokes equations are given by: $u_{it}(x,t)-\rho\triangle u_i(x,t)-u_j(x,t) u_{ix_j}(x,t)+p_{x_i}(x,t)=f_i(x,t)$ , $div\textbf{u}(x,t)=0$ with initial conditions $\textbf{u}|_{(t=0)\bigcup\partial\Omega}=0$.

The solution $u_i(x,t)$ of this problem is given by: $u_i(x,t) = \int_0^t \int_\Omega G(x,t;\xi,\tau)~\Big(w_i(\xi,\tau) + \frac{dp(\xi,\tau)}{d\xi_i}\Big)d\xi d\tau$ where $G(x,t;\xi,\tau)$ is the Green function. We consider the following N-Stokes-2 problem: find a solution $\textbf{w}(x,t)\in \textbf{L}_2(Q_t), p(x,t): p_{x_i}(x,t)\in L_2(Q_t)$ of the system of equations: $w_i(x,t)-G\Big(w_j(x,t)+\frac{dp(x,t)}{dx_j}\Big)\cdot G_{x_j}\Big(w_i(x,t)+\frac{dp(x,t)}{dx_i}\Big)=f_i(x,t)$ satisfying almost everywhere on $Q_t.$ Where the v-function $\textbf{p}_{x_i}(x,t)$ is defined by the v-function $\textbf{w}_i(x,t)$. Using the following estimates for the Green function: $|G(x,t;\xi ,\tau)| \leq\frac{c}{(t-\tau)^{\mu}\cdot |x-\xi|^{3-2\mu}}; |G_{x}(x,t;\xi,\tau)|\leq\frac{c}{(t-\tau)^{\mu}\cdot|x-\xi|^{3-(2\mu-1)}}(1/2<\mu<1),$ from this system of equations we obtain: $w(t)<f(t)+b\Big(\int_0^{t}\frac{w(\tau)}{(t-\tau)^{\mu}} d\tau\Big)^2$; $w(t)=\|\textbf{w}(x,t)\|_{L_2(\Omega)}, f(t)=\|\textbf{f}(x,t)\|_{L_2(\Omega)}.$ Further, using the replacement of the unknown function by \textbf{Riccati}, from this inequality we obtain the a priori estimate. By the Leray-Schauder's method and this a priori estimate the existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved.","(660, 8)","The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluids, and their solutions play a significant role in various fields of study, such as engineering, physics, and mathematics. However, the existence and smoothness of solutions to these equations remain an open problem. In this paper, we explore the current theoretical and numerical approaches to these questions.

The question of existence can be approached using techniques from functional analysis. The Navier-Stokes equations can be expressed as an initial value problem, where a unique solution exists if and only if the initial data satisfies certain compatibility conditions. However, proving the compatibility conditions can be challenging, and several global existence results remain unproved.

In terms of smoothness, the basic question is whether solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are regular or if singularities can occur. Regularity results have been established for low-dimensional flows and specific regimes such as small data solutions. For general three-dimensional flows, no conclusive results are known, and regularity may depend on the size of the data that generates the flow. Furthermore, the formation of singularities could potentially have significant practical consequences, such as breakage of fluid structures and energy dissipation.

To address these challenging problems, numerical simulations have been developed to study fluid flows and provide insight into the qualitative behavior of solutions. Computational methods such as finite element or spectral methods rely on discretizing the Navier-Stokes equations and solving them numerically using iterative algorithms. However, simulating fluid motion with high Reynolds number and complex geometries is still computationally expensive, which limits the accuracy and the range of applicability of the simulations.

We study the molecular correlations in a lattice model of a solution of a low-solubility ","We study the molecular correlations in a lattice model of a solution of a low-solubility solute, with emphasis on how the thermodynamics is reflected in the correlation functions. The model is treated in Bethe-Guggenheim approximation, which is exact on a Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). The solution properties are obtained in the limit of infinite dilution of the solute. With $h_{11}(r)$, $h_{12}(r)$, and $h_{22}(r)$ the three pair correlation functions as functions of the separation $r$ (subscripts 1 and 2 referring to solvent and solute, respectively), we find for $r \geq 2$ lattice steps that $h_{22}(r)/h_{12}(r) \equiv h_{12}(r)/h_{11}(r)$. This illustrates a general theorem that holds in the asymptotic limit of infinite $r$. The three correlation functions share a common exponential decay length (correlation length), but when the solubility of the solute is low the amplitude of the decay of $h_{22}(r)$ is much greater than that of $h_{12}(r)$, which in turn is much greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. As a consequence the amplitude of the decay of $h_{22}(r)$ is enormously greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. The effective solute-solute attraction then remains discernible at distances at which the solvent molecules are essentially no longer correlated, as found in similar circumstances in an earlier model. The second osmotic virial coefficient is large and negative, as expected. We find that the solvent-mediated part $W(r)$ of the potential of mean force between solutes, evaluated at contact, $r=1$, is related in this model to the Gibbs free energy of solvation at fixed pressure, $\Delta G_p^*$, by $(Z/2) W(1) + \Delta G_p^* \equiv p v_0$, where $Z$ is the coordination number of the lattice, $p$ the pressure, and $v_0$ the volume of the cell associated with each lattice site. A large, positive $\Delta G_p^*$ associated with the low solubility is thus reflected in a strong attraction (large negative $W$ at contact), which is the major contributor to the second osmotic virial coefficient. In this model, the low solubility (large positive $\Delta G_p^*$) is due partly to an unfavorable enthalpy of solvation and partly to an unfavorable solvation entropy, unlike in the hydrophobic effect, where the enthalpy of solvation itself favors high solubility, but is overweighed by the unfavorable solvation entropy.","(537, 12)","This research paper investigates the molecular correlations and solvation phenomena in simple fluids. Simple fluids are defined as those which do not contain a complicated mixture of molecular structures, thereby allowing for a more straightforward exploration of the fundamental interactions between molecules. The primary objective is to understand the extent to which the interactions between molecules influence solvation, which is the process by which a solid, liquid, or gas is dissolved in a solvent.

In order to conduct this investigation, molecular simulations have been employed, which allow for a systematic exploration of the effects of different parameters on the solvation process. Specifically, the simulations are based on the use of molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods, which are well-established tools for studying the behavior of simple fluids.

The results of the simulations demonstrate that molecular correlations are a crucial factor in determining the extent to which solvation occurs in different situations. In particular, it has been observed that molecular correlations strongly influence the structural and thermodynamic properties of the solvent, which has a direct impact on the solubility of the solute.

Moreover, this research paper highlights the importance of considering the specific molecular interactions that occur in different solvents, as they can significantly affect solvation behavior. For example, it has been shown that hydrogen bonding is an essential factor in determining solvation behavior in water, whereas dispersion forces play a more significant role in hydrocarbon solvents.

Overall, this research paper contributes to a better understanding of the molecular-level interactions that drive solvation behavior in different simple fluids. By employing molecular simulations and exploring the impact of different parameters, we gain insight into the fundamental principles that govern solvation phenomena, which has important implications for a wide range of industrial and scientific applications.","(326, 11)","We study the molecular correlations in a lattice model of a solution of a low-solubility ionic compound in a polar solvent.

Our lattice model consists of a cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions, where each lattice site can be occupied by either a solvent molecule or an ionic compound molecule. The solvent molecules interact with each other through a Lennard-Jones potential, while the ionic compound molecules interact with the solvent molecules through a Coulomb potential.

We perform Monte Carlo simulations to generate equilibrium configurations of the solution at various temperatures and concentrations.

We find that the RDFs and PCFs exhibit a rich structure, reflecting the complex interplay between the solvent-solvent, solvent-ionic compound, and ionic compound-ionic compound interactions.

To gain further insights into the molecular dynamics of the solution, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to track the motion of the solvent and ionic compound molecules over time.

We refer to these as the $R$-restricted Stirling numbers of the second and first kind and the $R$-restricted Lah numbers, respectively.

Note that the classical Stirling numbers of the second kind and first kind, and Lah numbers are ${n \brace k} = {n \brace k}_{\mathbb{N}}$, ${n \brack k} = {n \brack k}_{\mathbb{N}} $ and $L(n,k) = L(n,k)_{\mathbb{N}}$, respectively.

We report results from an updated study of the suppressed decays B- to D K- ","We report results from an updated study of the suppressed decays B- to D K- and B- to D* K- followed by D to K+pi-, where D(*) indicates a D(*)0 or an anti-D(*)0 meson, and D* decays to D pi0 or D gamma. These decays are sensitive to the CKM unitarity triangle angle gamma, due to interference between the b to c transition B- to D(*)0K- followed by the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decay D0 to K+pi-, and the b to u transition B- to anti-D(*)0K- followed by the Cabibbo-favored decay anti-D0 to K+pi-. We also report an analysis of the decay B- to D(*)pi- with the D decaying into the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed mode D to K+pi-. Our results are based on 467 million Upsilon (4S) to B anti-B decays collected with the BaBar detector at SLAC. We measure the ratios R(*) of the suppressed ([K+pi-]_D K-/pi-) to favored ([K-pi+]_D K-/pi-) branching fractions as well as the CP asymmetries A(*) of those modes. We see indications of signals for the B- to D K- and B- to D*K-, D*->D pi0 suppressed modes, with statistical significances of 2.1 and 2.2 sigma, respectively, and we measure: R_{DK} = (1.1\pm 0.6 \pm 0.2)\times 10^{-2}, A_{DK} = -0.86 \pm 0.47 \ ^{+0.12}_{-0.16}, R*_{(D pi0)K} = (1.8\pm 0.9 \pm 0.4)\times 10^{-2}, A*_{(D pi0)K} = +0.77 \pm 0.35\pm 0.12, R*_{(D gamma)K} = (1.3\pm 1.4\pm 0.8 )\times 10^{-2}, A*_{(D gamma)K} = +0.36 \pm 0.94\ ^{+0.25}_{-0.41}, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. We use a frequentist approach to obtain the magnitude of the ratio r_B = |A(B- to anti-D0 K-) / A(B- to D0K-)|= (9.5^{+5.1}_{-4.1})%, with r_B<16.7% at 90% confidence level. In the case of B- to D* K- we find r*_B = |A(B^- to anti-D*0 K-)/A(B- to D*0 K-)|=(9.6^{+3.5}_{-5.1})%, with r*_B<15.0% at 90% confidence level.","(497, 8)","The study of b --> u transitions in B- --> DK- and B- --> D*K- decays has emerged as a central topic in particle physics research. Flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes like these provide a powerful window into the Standard Model of particle physics and offer the chance to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we report on a search for the b --> u transition in these decays using data collected from the Belle experiment at the KEK-B laboratory in Japan.

The study comprises a sample of 772 x 10^6 B- B-bar pairs, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 711 fb^-1. The analysis uses a variety of techniques, including a multivariate technique to enhance the signal-to-background ratio and a likelihood fit to extract the b --> u signal yield. The residual background is found to be dominated by other FCNC processes.

The result obtained in the paper is the first evidence for the b --> u transition in the B- --> DK- decay, with a significance of 3.9 standard deviations. The significance for the B- --> D*K- decay is 2.5 standard deviations. These measurements are in good agreement with the Standard Model predictions and are consistent with previous measurements by other experiments. The measurement of the B- --> DK- decay is particularly important since it is a direct measurement of the CKM matrix element |Vub|.

Finally, we present an angular analysis of the B- --> D*K- decay, which is sensitive to the presence of new physics beyond the Standard Model. No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed.

In conclusion, we report the first evidence for the b --> u transition in the B- --> DK- decay and a measurement of the B- --> D*K- decay. These measurements are in good agreement with the Standard Model predictions and offer a new level of sensitivity to the CKM matrix element |Vub|. Furthermore, the angular analysis provides a more stringent test of the Standard Model and sets new constraints on the presence of new physics beyond the Standard Model.","(391, 15)","We report results from an updated study of the suppressed decays B- to D K-  and B- to D* K-, focusing on the search for b to u transitions in these processes.

Our analysis is based on a dataset of approximately 470 million B meson decays collected by the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider. We employ a novel approach to reconstruct the D and D* mesons, utilizing a combination of charged kaon identification and vertex reconstruction techniques to enhance the signal-to-background ratio. The D and D* candidates are then combined with the reconstructed B meson decay vertex to form the B to D K- and B to D* K- decay modes, respectively.

To identify potential b to u transitions, we apply a series of selection criteria to the reconstructed decays, including requirements on the invariant mass of the D K- and D* K- systems, as well as constraints on the kinematic variables of the B meson decay. We also implement a multivariate analysis using a boosted decision tree algorithm to further enhance the signal purity and reduce the impact of background contributions.

Our results are presented in terms of the measured branching fractions for the two decay modes, as well as the corresponding upper limits on the b to u transition rates. We find that the observed branching fractions are consistent with the expectations from the Standard Model, with no evidence for significant deviations.

If R is a nonseparating simple closed curve on the boundary of a genus two ","If R is a nonseparating simple closed curve on the boundary of a genus two handlebody H and H[R] has incompressible boundary, then there exists a unique arc omega in bdry(H), meeting R only in its endpoints, such that, omega is isotopic in bdry(H), keeping its endpoints on R, to a nontrivial wave based at R in each Heegaard diagram of R on bdry(H) which has no cut-vertex. Then surgery on R along its ""distinguished-wave"" omega yields a pair of simple closed curves, say m_1 and m_2, in bdry(H), each representing an ""omega-determined-slope"" m on bdry(H[R]), that depends only on R and H.

A few consequences: 1) Only Dehn filling of H[R] at slope m can yield S^3, (S^1 X S^2) # L(p,q), or S^1 X S^2. So H[R] embeds in at most one of S^3, (S^1 X S^2) # L(p,q), or S^1 X S^2. And, if such an embedding exists, it is unique.

2) Theta curves arising from unknotting tunnels of tunnel-number-one knots in S^3, S^1 X S^2, or (S^1 X S^2) # L(p,q), have canonical component knots. 3) One can recognize (1,1) tunnels of (1,1) knots in S^3 or S^1 X S^2. 4) Algorithms for recognizing genus two Heegaard diagrams of S^3, S^1 X S^2, or (S^1 X S^2) # L(p,q) that use waves can be streamlined. 5) Efficient procedures for computing the depth of an unknotting tunnel of a knot in S^3, S^1 X S^2, or (S^1 X S^2) # L(p,q) exist.

Finally, if H[R_1] is homeomorphic to H[R_2], but (H,R_1) and (H,R_2) are not homeomorphic, then the omega-determined slopes on bdry(H[R_1]) and bdry(H[R_2]) may differ.

However, computation suggests that, if 'R' is a set of simple closed curves on bdry(H) such that R_1 in 'R' and R_2 in 'R' means H[R_1] is homeomorphic to H[R_2], then at most two distinct slopes appear as omega-determined slopes for curves in 'R', and that, if such distinct omega-determined slopes exist, they are never more than distance one apart.","(490, 10)","The study of distinguished waves and slopes in genus two has great potential to contribute to the field of algebraic curves and surfaces. In this paper, we explore these concepts in depth, focusing specifically on the genus two case. We begin by defining what we mean by distinguished waves and slopes, and introduce a number of key results from existing literature in the field.

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these concepts in the context of genus two algebraic curves. We begin by establishing the existence of distinguished slopes, and proving some key properties of their associated moduli spaces. Next, we discuss the construction of model curves using distinguished slopes, which we show to be an effective and useful method for understanding the properties of genus two curves.

One of the key contributions of our work is the development of a theory of distinguished waves on genus two curves. We show that these waves can be constructed using techniques similar to those used in the construction of model curves, and we investigate the properties of these waves and their associated moduli spaces. We also show how distinguished waves can be used to relate different families of genus two curves, and provide examples of how this technique can be used in practice.

Throughout our paper, we focus on concrete examples to illustrate the concepts and techniques we introduce. We make use of computer algebra systems to generate and analyze data, and we provide code and data files to help readers reproduce our results. We also include a number of open problems and directions for further research, to encourage others to build on our work and explore these concepts in even greater depth.

In conclusion, our paper provides a thorough exploration of the concepts of distinguished waves and slopes in genus two, and establishes a number of new results in the field. We believe that our work will be of great interest to researchers in algebraic curves and surfaces, and we look forward to seeing how our results are built upon in future research.","(373, 14)","If R is a nonseparating simple closed curve on the boundary of a genus two 3-manifold M, then it is known that there exists a Heegaard splitting of M along R. In this paper, we investigate the properties of the distinguished waves and slopes associated with such a splitting. Our main goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the geometric and topological features of these waves and slopes, and to explore their implications for the study of 3-manifolds.

We begin by reviewing the existing literature on Heegaard splittings and distinguished waves. A Heegaard splitting is a decomposition of a 3-manifold into two handlebodies, each of which is a 3-dimensional handlebody. Distinguished waves, on the other hand, are certain types of curves on the boundary of the handlebodies that play a crucial role in the study of Heegaart splittings.

$Local^{3}$ Index Theorem means $Local(Local(Local \;Index \; Theorem)))$. $Local \; Index \; Theorem$ is the ","$Local^{3}$ Index Theorem means $Local(Local(Local \;Index \; Theorem)))$.

$Local \; Index \; Theorem$ is the Connes-Moscovici local index theorem \cite{Connes-Moscovici1}, \cite{Connes-Moscovici2}. The second ""Local"" refers to the cyclic homology localised to a certain separable subring of the ground algebra, while the last one refers to Alexander-Spanier type cyclic homology.

The Connes-Moscovici work is based on the operator $R(A) = \mathbf{P} - \mathbf{e}$ associated to the elliptic pseudo-differential operator $A$ on the smooth manifold $M$, where $\mathbf{P}$, $\mathbf{e}$ are idempotents, see \cite{Connes-Moscovici1}, Pg. 353. The operator $R(A)$ has two main merits: it is a smoothing operator and its distributional kernel is situated in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the diagonal in $M \times M$. The operator $R(A)$ has also two setbacks: -i) it is not an idempotent (and therefore it does not have a genuine Connes-Chern character); -ii) even if it were an idempotent, its Connes-Chern character would belong to the cyclic homology of the algebra of smoothing operators (with \emph{arbitrary} supports, which is \emph{trivial}. This paper presents a new solution to the difficulties raised by the two setbacks. For which concerns -i), we show that although $R(A)$ is not an idempotent, it satisfies the identity $ (\mathbf{R}(A))^{2} \;=\; \mathbf{R}(A) - [\mathbf{R}(A) . e + e .\mathbf{R}(A) ]. $ We show that the operator $R(A)$ has a genuine Chern character provided the cyclic homology complex of the algebra of smoothing operators is \emph{localised} to the separable sub-algebra $\Lambda = \mathbb{C} + \mathbb{C} . e$, see Sect. 8.1.

For which concerns -ii), we introduce the notion of \emph{local} cyclic homology; this is constructed on the foot-steps of the Alexander-Spanier homology, i.e. by filtering the chains of the cyclic homology complex of the algebra of smoothing operators by their distributional support, see Sect. 7.

Using these new instruments, we give a reformulation of the Connes-Moscovici local Index Theorem, see Theorem 23, Sect. 9. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the \emph{local} cyclic homology of the algebra of smoothing operators is at least as big as the Alexander-Spanier homology of the base manifold. The present reformulation of Connes-Moscovici local index theorem opens the way to new investigations, see Sect. 10.","(544, 21)","The $Local^{3}$ Index Theorem is a fundamental theorem in spectral geometry and was first developed by Alain Connes in 1985. The theorem concerns the spectral properties of certain non-compact manifolds with singularities, and has important applications in physics and mathematics.

The $Local^{3}$ Index Theorem provides a formula for the index of an operator on a manifold with corners. The index is a topological invariant that counts the difference between the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of the operator. This formula involves the so-called ""Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary condition"" which is a generalization of the classical Dirichlet condition for elliptic operators.

One of the main applications of the $Local^{3}$ Index Theorem is in the study of the geometric quantization of symplectic manifolds. In this context, the index gives an obstruction to the existence of a polarizing section, which is a key concept in the quantization procedure.

Another important application of the $Local^{3}$ Index Theorem is in the study of the signature operator on four-manifolds. The signature operator is a natural elliptic operator that measures the difference between the number of positive and negative spinors on a Riemannian four-manifold. The $Local^{3}$ Index Theorem can be used to compute the index of the signature operator on a manifold with corners, and hence provides a powerful tool for studying the topology of four-manifolds.

Recently, the $Local^{3}$ Index Theorem has also been applied to the study of the AdS/CFT correspondence, which is a conjectured duality between a certain type of string theory and a conformal field theory in one dimension lower. In particular, the theorem can be used to compute the index of certain operators on the boundary of the anti-de Sitter space, which is a key ingredient in testing the AdS/CFT correspondence.

In conclusion, the $Local^{3}$ Index Theorem is a fundamental result in spectral geometry with important applications in topology, physics and string theory. Its formula for the index of an operator on a manifold with corners has proved to be a powerful tool in the study of geometric quantization, four-manifold topology and the AdS/CFT correspondence.","(403, 14)","$Local^{3}$ Index Theorem means $Local(Local(Local \;Index \; Theorem)))$. $Local \; Index \; Theorem$ is the 1st version of the Index Theorem. $Local^{2}$ Index Theorem is the 2nd version. $Local^{3}$ is the 3rd version. This paper is about $Local^{3}$. 

Abstract: 
The Local Index Theorem (LIT) is a fundamental result in index theory, providing a deep understanding of the relationship between the geometry of a manifold and the spectrum of its Dirac operator. However, the original LIT has several limitations, particularly when dealing with manifolds that are not compact or have non-trivial topology. To address these limitations, we introduce the Local^3 Index Theorem (LLIT), a refined version of the LIT that incorporates additional geometric and topological information. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive treatment of the LLIT, including its formulation, proof, and applications.

The LLIT is motivated by the need to extend the LIT to a broader class of manifolds, including those with non-trivial topology and non-compact boundaries. To achieve this, we employ a novel combination of techniques from index theory, differential geometry, and algebraic topology. Specifically, we develop a new framework for computing the local index of a Dirac operator on a manifold with boundary, which takes into account the geometry of the boundary and the topology of the manifold. This framework is then used to prove the LLIT, which provides a precise formula for the local index in terms of the geometry and topology of the manifold.

One of the key innovations of the LLIT is its use of a new type of index, which we call the ""local^3 index."" This index is a refinement of the traditional local index, taking into account not only the geometry of the manifold but also its topology and the behavior of the Dirac operator near the boundary. The local^3 index is defined using a combination of analytical and algebraic tools, including the use of pseudodifferential operators and K-theory. We show that the local^3 index satisfies a number of desirable properties, including invariance under diffeomorphisms and additivity under disjoint unions.

The LLIT has a number of important implications for index theory and its applications.

The linear Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions are given by: $u_{it}(x,t)-\rho \triangle u_i(x,t)-p_{x_i}(x,t)=$ $w_i(x,t)$ , ","The linear Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions are given by: $u_{it}(x,t)-\rho \triangle u_i(x,t)-p_{x_i}(x,t)=$ $w_i(x,t)$ , $div \textbf{u}(x,t)=0,i=1,2,3$ with initial conditions: $\textbf{u}|_{(t=0)\bigcup\partial\Omega}=0$. The Green function to the Dirichlet problem $\textbf{u}|_{(t=0)\bigcup\partial\Omega}=0$ of the equation $u_{it}(x,t)-\rho\triangle u_i(x,t)=f_i(x,t)$ present as: $G(x,t;\xi,\tau)=Z(x,t;\xi,\tau)+V(x,t;\xi,\tau).$ Where $Z(x,t;\xi,\tau)=\frac{1}{8\pi^{3/2}(t-\tau)^{3/2}}\cdot e^{-\frac{(x_1-\xi_1)^2+(x_2-\xi_2)^2+(x_3-\xi_3)^2}{4(t-\tau)}}$ is the fundamental solution to this equation and $V(x,t;\xi,\tau)$ is the smooth function of variables $(x,t;\xi,\tau)$. The construction of the function $G(x,t;\xi,\tau)$ is resulted in the book [1 p.106]. By the Green function we present the Navier-Stokes equation as: $u_i(x,t)=\int_0^t\int_{\Omega}\Big(Z(x,t;\xi,\tau)+V(x,t;\xi,\tau)\Big)\frac{dp(\xi,\tau)}{d\xi}d\xi d\tau +\int_0^t\int_{\Omega}G(x,t;\xi,\tau)w_i(\xi,\tau)d\xi d\tau$. But $div \textbf{u}(x,t)=\sum_1^3 \frac{du_i(x,t)}{dx_i}=0.$ Using these equations and the following properties of the fundamental function: $Z(x,t;\xi,\tau)$: $\frac{dZ(x,t;\xi,\tau)}{d x_i}=-\frac{d Z(x,t; \xi,\tau)}{d \xi_i},$ for the definition of the unknown pressure p(x,t) we shall receive the integral equation. From this integral equation we define the explicit expression of the pressure: $p(x,t)=-\frac{d}{dt}\triangle^{-1}\ast\int_0^t\int_{\Omega}\sum_1^3 \frac{dG(x,t;\xi,\tau)}{dx_i}w_i(\xi,\tau)d\xi d\tau+\rho\cdot\int_0^t\int_{\Omega}\sum_1^3\frac{dG(x,t;\xi,\tau)}{dx_i}w_i(\xi,\tau)d\xi d\tau.$ By this formula the following estimate: $\int_0^t\sum_1^3\Big\|\frac{\partial p(x,\tau)}{\partial x_i}\Big\|_{L_2(\Omega)}^2 d \tau<c\cdot\int_0^t\sum_1^3\|w_i(x,\tau)\|_{L_2(\Omega)}^2 d\tau$ holds.","(620, 6)","The Navier-Stokes equation is a fundamental model used for the description of fluid motion.

We begin by providing a detailed description of the linear Navier-Stokes equation, including its assumptions and related theories. We then present the estimates of the solution, which include both upper and lower bounds on the solution's behavior.

Our approach involves rigorous mathematical analysis, which relies on the theory of partial differential equations and functional analysis. We formulate the problem as a well-posed mathematical question and apply various techniques to obtain estimates on the solution.

To demonstrate the applicability of our results, we present several numerical examples showing the behavior of the estimated solutions. We show that our estimates can serve as a reliable tool for predicting the behavior of fluid flows under certain conditions.

We provide new and improved congruences for these sums that extend previous work in the field. Specifically, we study congruences involving sums over all positive integers and over odd positive integers only.

Our approach is based on the generation function method, which we use to derive closed-form expressions for intermediate functions related to the sums in question. We then use these expressions to establish congruences that are more general and stronger than previous results.

Our main results provide congruences involving prime powers, which generalize existing results involving only prime numbers. Furthermore, we show that certain congruences involving sums over odd integers can be expressed in terms of congruences involving sums over all integers. This interplay between congruences over different sets of integers is a novel contribution to the field.

Several examples are provided to illustrate our results. In particular, we consider congruences involving prime powers for sums of products of Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers, as well as congruences for harmonic sums corresponding to arithmetic sequences. These examples demonstrate the broad applicability of our results and the potential for further exploration in related areas.

Finally, we discuss open problems and directions for future research. One interesting direction is to extend our results to other types of sums and to consider various deformation parameters. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore the potential connections between our work and other areas of number theory and combinatorics, such as modular forms and partitions.

Two unavoidable processes punctuate our century: The unprecedented urbanisation of our planet (United Nations, 2014) ","Two unavoidable processes punctuate our century: The unprecedented urbanisation of our planet (United Nations, 2014) and the spread of ubiquitous computing (Weiser, 1991) and urban data streams. This process of urbanisation corresponds with the process of digitalisation of urban life: while urbanisation acts on a physical infrastructural level, the digital develops as a kind of metastructure above the infrastructure. This metastructural level offers a flexible framework through which information is continuously and operatively being symbolized. Today, Information technology and the availability of abundant urban data streams could be considered as forerunners of our time, having unprecedented impacts comparable to the ones brought by the steam engine at the dawn of industrialisation and the electrification of cities. It is therefore no longer conceivable to think of the physical structure of the city without including its digital counterpart. Against this background, we will explore the role of computational power and information technologies as dominant factors in the formation of computational urban models and normative city theories. We will show how these models and theories, emerging mainly during the 19th and 20th centuries, present leaping correspondences with more ancient conceptions of the city, when observed from a meta-level or episteme (Foucault, 2002) approach. First, and for the sake of clarity, we will deal with some methodological elucidations around the concepts of theory, model and episteme, and how we will refer conceptually to these terms throughout this paper. Secondly, we will review these evolving technological and computational levels of abstraction and their influence on the different conceptions of the city. Thirdly, we will develop the hypothesis of a conceptual gap, between our current technological capacity -- grounded on the abundance and availability of urban data streams -- and the state of the art in urban modelling and city theory. Lastly, building upon Foucault's concept of episteme (Foucault, 1970) and genealogy (Foucault, 1977b), we will explore this gap by speculating around the possibility of an inversion in computational urban modelling and city theory. And above all, we will question the terms in which we can think of the city, in an age where the world can be virtually conceived as fully urban, and the continuity and abundance of urban data streams giving account of it can be taken for granted. How are we articulating the phenomena we call city on top of this generic common ground?","(441, 13)","This research paper explores the intersection of normative city theories and computational urban models in order to develop strategies for a harmonious coexistence with the ever-increasing flow of urban data streams. By inverting traditional approaches, we propose a new method for analyzing urban systems that prioritizes dynamic data-driven solutions over fixed theoretical constructs. 

Our study draws from a diverse set of sources to construct a multifaceted framework for understanding the complex interplay between urban data and spatial organization. This includes an overview of normative city theories, which have long been used as the basis for urban planning but have often struggled to keep pace with the rapidly changing needs of modern cities. We also review contemporary computational urban models, which provide new ways of analyzing spatial data but can sometimes be limited by their reliance on fixed assumptions.

We then present a series of case studies, drawing on examples from around the globe, to illustrate the potential impact of our approach. These studies demonstrate the ways in which urban data streams can be harnessed to promote sustainable development, improve transportation networks, and enhance public safety. We also examine the potential challenges and ethical concerns that may arise from a data-driven approach to city planning.

Overall, our findings suggest that by inverting normative city theories and adopting a computational approach, we can develop strategies for a more effective and dynamic coexistence with urban data streams. This requires a willingness to embrace uncertainty and change, as well as an openness to new forms of collaboration and knowledge production. By doing so, we can create cities that are more resilient, sustainable, and responsive to the needs of their residents.","(300, 11)","Two unavoidable processes punctuate our century: The unprecedented urbanisation of our planet (United Nations, 2014)  and the exponential growth of digital data (Manyika et al., 2011). These phenomena have led to the development of normative city theories (NCTs) and computational urban models (CUMs), which aim to understand, predict, and optimise urban dynamics. However, both NCTs and CUMs have been critiqued for their limitations in capturing the complexities and nuances of real-world urban systems (Batty, 2013; Graham & Marvin, 2001). This paper seeks to address these limitations by inverting the traditional approach to urban theory and modelling, instead focusing on the coexistence of NCTs, CUMs, and urban data streams.

To achieve this, we employed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. We conducted in-depth interviews with urban planners, policymakers, and data scientists to understand their perspectives on the current state of urban theory and modelling. We also collected and analysed large-scale urban data sets from various sources, including social media, sensor networks, and administrative records. These data sets were used to develop and test novel computational models that integrate NCTs and urban data streams. Our results show that the inverted approach can lead to more accurate and robust predictions of urban dynamics, as well as new insights into the complex relationships between urban form, function, and behaviour.

One of the key findings of this study is the importance of considering the temporal and spatial dimensions of urban data streams. By analysing the temporal patterns of urban data, we were able to identify subtle changes in urban dynamics that were not captured by traditional NCTs or CUMs. For example, our analysis of social media data revealed a strong correlation between the timing of urban events (e.g., festivals, protests) and changes in urban sentiment. Similarly, our analysis of sensor network data showed that the spatial distribution of urban activities (e.g., traffic flow, pedestrian movement) is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including urban morphology, land use, and socio-economic characteristics.

Our results also highlight the potential of urban data streams to inform urban planning and policy-making.

Within the framework of a global French program oriented towards the development of renewable energies, ","Within the framework of a global French program oriented towards the development of renewable energies, Martinique Island (Lesser Antilles, France) has been extensively investigated (from 2012 to 2013) through an integrated multi-methods approach, with the aim to define precisely the potential geothermal ressources, previously highlighted (Sanjuan et al., 2003). Amongst the common investigation methods deployed, we carried out three magnetotelluric (MT) surveys located above three of the most promising geothermal fields of Martinique, namely the Anses d'Arlet, the Montagne Pel{\'e}e and the Pitons du Carbet prospects. A total of about 100 MT stations were acquired showing single or multi-dimensional behaviors and static shift effects. After processing data with remote reference, 3-D MT inversions of the four complex elements of MT impedance tensor without pre-static-shift correction, have been performed for each sector, providing three 3-D resistivity models down to about 12 to 30 km depth. The sea coast effect has been taken into account in the 3-D inversion through generation of a 3-D resistivity model including the bathymetry around Martinique from the coast up to a distance of 200 km. The forward response of the model is used to calculate coast effect coefficients that are applied to the calculated MT response during the 3-D inversion process for comparison with the observed data. 3-D resistivity models of each sector, which are inherited from different geological history, show 3-D resistivity distribution and specificities related to its volcanological history. In particular, the geothermal field related to the Montagne Pel{\'e}e strato-volcano, is characterized by a quasi ubiquitous conductive layer and quite monotonic typical resistivity distribution making interpretation difficult in terms of geothermal targets. At the opposite, the resistivity distribution of Anse d'Arlet area is radically different and geothermal target is thought to be connected to a not so deep resistive intrusion elongated along a main structural axis. Beside these interesting deep structures, we demonstrate, after analyzing the results of the recent heliborne TEM survey covering the whole Martinique, that surface resistivity distribution obtained from 3-D inversion reproduce faithfully the resistivity distribution observed by TEM. In spite of a very different sampling scale, this comparison illustrates the ability of 3-D MT inversion to take into account and reproduce static shift effects in the sub-surface resistivity distribution.","(421, 11)","This paper presents the results of 3-D Magnetotelluric investigations conducted for geothermal exploration in Martinique, Lesser Antilles. The study aimed to identify characteristic deep resistivity structures and match them with the shallow resistivity distribution. The research involved data acquisition through surveys and modeling using inversion processing.

The Magnetotelluric method enables the measurement of the Earth's electrical resistivity distribution, from which information on geological structures can be inferred. The study area is part of the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc, which is known for its high geothermal potential. The Magnetotelluric data were collected along six profiles using both land and marine stations. The acquired data were processed to obtain impedance tensors, which were further inverted to obtain resistivity models of the subsurface.

The results revealed distinct deep resistivity structures, which corresponded to known geological features. The low resistivity zones indicated the occurrence of hydrothermal systems beneath the survey area. The shallow resistivity distribution matched Heliborne TEM (Time-domain electromagnetic) results. The shallow resistivity structures were characterized by high resistivity zones, which are typical features of altered or metamorphosed rocks that are associated with hydrothermal systems.

The correlation between the deep and shallow resistivity structures provides evidence for the presence of hydrothermal systems in the study area. These findings may have significant implications for geothermal exploration, as they provide insights into the nature of the subsurface. The results suggest that the region's geothermal potential lies in the areas around the low resistivity zones, which likely represent high-temperature geothermal reservoirs.

In conclusion, the study demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of the Magnetotelluric method in exploring geothermal resources. The 3-D resistivity models produced from the Magnetotelluric data provide valuable information on the geological structures of the subsurface. The findings indicate potential high-temperature geothermal reservoirs in the study area and provide a basis for future exploration efforts.","(330, 17)","Within the framework of a global French program oriented towards the development of renewable energies, 3-D magnetotelluric (MT) investigations were conducted on the island of Martinique, located in the Lesser Antilles. The primary objective of this research was to identify characteristic deep resistivity structures and shallow resistivity distribution matching heliborne transient electromagnetic (TEM) results, with the ultimate goal of enhancing geothermal exploration in the region.

To achieve this objective, a 3-D MT survey was carried out over an area of approximately 100 km^2, covering the northern part of the island. The survey involved the deployment of 24 MT stations, each equipped with three components of electric field and two components of magnetic field sensors. Data acquisition was performed over a period of several weeks, with a sampling rate of 1 Hz. The collected data were then processed using a 3-D inversion algorithm to obtain resistivity models of the subsurface.

The results of the 3-D MT inversion revealed a complex resistivity structure beneath the study area, characterized by the presence of several resistive and conductive bodies. The resistive bodies were found to be associated with granitic and metamorphic rocks, while the conductive bodies were linked to sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The resistivity models also indicated the presence of a conductive layer at a depth of approximately 1-2 km, which was interpreted as a hydrothermal alteration zone. This zone was found to be spatially correlated with areas of high heat flow and seismicity, suggesting a possible link between the hydrothermal activity and the geothermal potential of the region.

The 3-D MT results were compared with heliborne TEM data acquired over the same area, and a good match was observed between the two datasets. The TEM data provided additional information on the shallow resistivity distribution, which was found to be consistent with the MT results. The combination of 3-D MT and TEM data allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface resistivity structure and its relationship to the geothermal system.

The implications of this research are significant, as they provide new insights into the subsurface resistivty structure and geothermal potential of Martinique. The results of this study can be used to inform future geothermal exploration efforts in the region, potentially leading to the development of new geothermal resources. Furthermore, the methodology employed in this study can be applied to other regions with similar geological settings, providing a valuable tool for geothermal exploration and resource assessment.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of 3-D M T investigations in characterizing the deep resistivity structure and shallow resistivity","(462, 17)","Within the framework of a global French program oriented towards the development of renewable energies, 3-D magnetotellurics (MT) surveys were carried out in the Lesser Antilles (Martinique, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Saint-Barthélemy, Saint-Martin, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon) in order to characterize deep resistivity structures and shallow resistivity distribution matching heliborne time-domain electromagnetics (TDEM) results.

The 3C MT data were used to map the deep resistivity structure of the crust and upper mantle.
The shallow resistivity structure was mapped using the TDEM data.

The deep resistivity of the crust is characterized by a low resistivity (< 10 ohm-m) and a low conductivity (< 0.1 S/m).
The upper mantle is characterized by high resistivity (> 100 ohm m) and high conductivity (> 0.5 S/m)
The resistivity distribution of the upper mantle is similar to that of the crust.

To achieve this objective, a 3-D MT survey was carried out over an area of approximately 100 km^2, covering the northern part of the island. The survey involved the deployment of 24 MT stations, each equipped with three components of electric field and two components of magnetic field sensors. Data acquisition was performed over a period of several weeks, with a sampling rate of 1 Hz. The collected data were then processed using a 3-D inversion algorithm to obtain resistivity models of the subsurface.

The results of the 3-D MT inversion revealed a complex resistivity structure beneath the study area, characterized by the presence of several resistive and conductive bodies. The resistive bodies were found to be associated with granitic and metamorphic rocks, while the conductive bodies were linked to sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The resistivity models also indicated the presence of a conductive layer at a depth of approximately 1-2 km, which was interpreted as a hydrothermal alteration zone. This zone was found to be spatially correlated with areas of high heat flow and seismicity, suggesting a possible link between the hydrothermal activity and the geothermal potential of the region.

The 3-D MT results were compared with heliborne TEM data acquired over the same area, and a good match was observed between the two datasets. The TEM data provided additional information on the shallow resistivity distribution, which was found to be consistent with the MT results. The combination of 3-D MT and TEM data allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface resistivity structure and its relationship to the geothermal system.

The implications of this research are significant, as they provide new insights into the subsurface resistivty structure and geothermal potential of Martinique. The results of this study can be used to inform future geothermal exploration efforts in the region, potentially leading to the development of new geothermal resources. Furthermore, the methodology employed in this study can be applied to other regions with similar geological settings, providing a valuable tool for geothermal exploration and resource assessment.

The MT surveys were performed with a 3-component (3C) array with a 100 m spacing. The MT data were processed using a 3D MT inversion software.
The 3C MT data were used to map the deep resistivity structure of the crust and upper mantle.
The shallow resistivity structure was mapped using the TDEM data.
The results of the MT and TDEM inversions were compared.
The main results of this study are the following:
The deep resistivity of the crust is characterized by a low resistivity (< 10 ohm-m) and a low conductivity (< 0.1 S/m).
The upper mantle is characterized by high resistivity (> 100 ohm m) and high conductivity (> 0.5 S/m)
The resistivity distribution of the upper mantle is similar to that of the crust.
The TDEM results are consistent with the MT results.","(462, 17)","(217, 9)"

This is the first paper of a series in which we plan to study spectral ","This is the first paper of a series in which we plan to study spectral asymptotics for sub-Riemannian Laplacians and to extend results that are classical in the Riemannian case concerning Weyl measures, quantum limits, quantum ergodicity, quasi-modes, trace formulae.Even if hypoelliptic operators have been well studied from the point of view of PDEs, global geometrical and dynamical aspects have not been the subject of much attention. As we will see, already in the simplest case, the statements of the results in the sub-Riemannian setting are quite different from those in the Riemannian one.

Let us consider a sub-Riemannian (sR) metric on a closed three-dimensional manifold with an oriented contact distribution. There exists a privileged choice of the contact form, with an associated Reeb vector field and a canonical volume form that coincides with the Popp measure. We establish a Quantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of any associated sR Laplacian under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. The limit measure is given by the normalized Popp measure.This is the first time that such a result is established for a hypoelliptic operator, whereas the usual Shnirelman theorem yields QE for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a closed Riemannian manifold with ergodic geodesic flow.To prove our theorem, we first establish a microlocal Weyl law, which allows us to identify the limit measure and to prove the microlocal concentration of the eigenfunctions on the characteristic manifold of the sR Laplacian. Then, we derive a Birkhoff normal form along this characteristic manifold, thus showing that, in some sense, all 3D contact structures are microlocally equivalent. The quantum version of this normal form provides a useful microlocal factorization of the sR Laplacian. Using the normal form, the factorization and the ergodicity assumption, we finally establish a variance estimate, from which QE follows.We also obtain a second result, which is valid without any ergodicity assumption: every Quantum Limit (QL) can be decomposed in a sum of two mutually singular measures: the first measure is supported on the unit cotangent bundle and is invariant under the sR geodesic flow, and the second measure is supported on the characteristic manifold of the sR Laplacian and is invariant under the lift of the Reeb flow.

Moreover, we prove that the first measure is zero for most QLs.","(420, 10)","In this paper, we study spectral asymptotics for sub-Riemannian Laplacians in the 3D contact case, focusing on quantum ergodicity and quantum limits. Our investigation is motivated by the need to understand the behavior of a system in the presence of singularities, which can lead to nontrivial phenomena. We demonstrate that the spectra of such Laplacians exhibit strong regularity properties, both in the quantum and classical regimes. Our main result is a new proof of quantum ergodicity for the 3D contact case, which implies that the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian become uniformly distributed in phase space. This extends previous results obtained in other settings, and sheds new light on the behavior of Laplacians on manifolds with degenerate metrics. We also establish a range of new results concerning the structure of the spectrum, including the existence of quantum limits, restrictions on the growth of eigenvalues, and the relationship between the Laplacian and the geodesic flow. Our approach is based on a combination of geometric and analytic techniques, and relies heavily on the use of microlocal analysis and semiclassical analysis. As a consequence, our results have implications for a wide range of problems in mathematical physics and geometry, including the study of wave propagation, scattering theory, and geometric quantization. We conclude by discussing some open questions and future directions for research in this area.","(244, 9)","This is the first paper of a series in which we plan to study spectral  asymptotics for sub- Riemannian  Laplacians.

The ejecta of the first probably very massive stars polluted the Big Bang primordial element ","The ejecta of the first probably very massive stars polluted the Big Bang primordial element mix with the first heavier elements. The resulting ultra metal-poor abundance distribution provided the initial conditions for the second stars of a wide range of initial masses reaching down to intermediate and low masses. The importance of these second stars for understanding the origin of the elements in the early universe are manifold. While the massive first stars have long vanished the second stars are still around and currently observed. They are the carriers of the information about the first stars, but they are also capable of nuclear production themselves. For example, in order to use ultra or extremely metal-poor stars as a probe for the r-process in the early universe a reliable model of the s-process in the second stars is needed.

Eventually, the second stars may provide us with important clues on questions ranging from structure formation to how the stars actually make the elements, not only in the early but also in the present universe. In particular the C-rich extremely metal-poor stars, most of which show the s-process signature, are thought to be associated with chemical yields from the evolved giant phase of intermediate mass stars. Models of such AGB stars at extremely low metallicity now exist, and comparison with observation show important discrepancies, for example with regard to the synthesis of nitrogen. This may hint at burning and mixing aspects of extremely metal-poor evolved stars that are not yet included in the standard picture of evolution, as for example the hydrogen-ingestion flash. The second stars of intermediate mass may have also played an important role in the formation of heavy elements that form through slow neutron capture reaction chains (s-process). Comparison of models with observations reveal which aspects of the physics input and assumptions need to be improved. The s-process is a particularly useful diagnostic tool for probing the physical processes that are responsible for the creation of elements in stars, like for example rotation. As new observational techniques and strategies continue to penetrate the field, for example the multi-object spectroscopy, or the future spectroscopic surveys, the extremely metal-poor stars will play an increasingly important role to address some of the most fundamental and challenging, current questions of astronomy.","(408, 14)","The second generation of stars are denoted by those formed from the remnants of previous stellar generations, bearing distinct chemical compositions and histories. In this research, we investigate the process of star formation within early galaxies, where the presence of primordial gas clouds and varying levels of heavy element enrichment play a significant role in shaping subsequent stellar populations. By simulating the physical conditions and evolutionary pathways of these galaxies through cosmological time, we reveal the complex interplay of feedback mechanisms between stars and their surrounding environment. Our findings demonstrate the sensitivity of star formation to small changes in environmental and chemical conditions, with even minute variations leading to the formation of distinct stellar populations and the subsequent enrichment of galactic gas reservoirs. Crucially, we find that the role of the second-generation stars in shaping galactic evolution is often underappreciated, with the era of their formation playing a key role in setting the stage for the diversity of stellar populations observed across the universe. Through a combination of observations and simulations, we suggest that the second-generation stars may hold the key to unlocking some of the most pressing questions in modern astrophysics, from the origins of heavy elements to the mechanisms driving galaxy formation and evolution.

Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) comprise a network of sensors subcutaneously implanted or placed near ","Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) comprise a network of sensors subcutaneously implanted or placed near the body surface and facilitate continuous monitoring of health parameters of a patient. Research endeavours involving WBAN are directed towards effective transmission of detected parameters to a Local Processing Unit (LPU, usually a mobile device) and analysis of the parameters at the LPU or a back-end cloud. An important concern in WBAN is the lightweight nature of WBAN nodes and the need to conserve their energy. This is especially true for subcutaneously implanted nodes that cannot be recharged or regularly replaced. Work in energy conservation is mostly aimed at optimising the routing of signals to minimise energy expended. In this paper, a simple yet innovative approach to energy conservation and detection of alarming health status is proposed. Energy conservation is ensured through a two-tier approach wherein the first tier eliminates `uninteresting' health parameter readings at the site of a sensing node and prevents these from being transmitted across the WBAN to the LPU. A reading is categorised as uninteresting if it deviates very slightly from its immediately preceding reading and does not provide new insight on the patient's well being. In addition to this, readings that are faulty and emanate from possible sensor malfunctions are also eliminated. These eliminations are done at the site of the sensor using algorithms that are light enough to effectively function in the extremely resource-constrained environments of the sensor nodes. We notice, through experiments, that this eliminates and thus reduces around 90% of the readings that need to be transmitted to the LPU leading to significant energy savings. Furthermore, the proper functioning of these algorithms in such constrained environments is confirmed and validated over a hardware simulation set up. The second tier of assessment includes a proposed anomaly detection model at the LPU that is capable of identifying anomalies from streaming health parameter readings and indicates an adverse medical condition. In addition to being able to handle streaming data, the model works within the resource-constrained environments of an LPU and eliminates the need of transmitting the data to a back-end cloud, ensuring further energy savings. The anomaly detection capability of the model is validated using data available from the critical care units of hospitals and is shown to be superior to other anomaly detection techniques.","(417, 15)","An increasing number of people are relying on technology to keep track of their personal health information and share it with healthcare professionals if necessary.

This paper presents an energy-efficient health monitoring approach using WBANs. The proposed approach focuses on minimizing the energy consumption of WBANs while ensuring accurate and reliable health monitoring. The methodology employed in this study involves the design and implementation of a novel energy-efficient protocol for WBANs. This protocol utilizes a combination of data aggregation and compression techniques to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network, thereby minimizing energy consumption.

The proposed protocol consists of two main components: a data aggregation module and a data compression module. The data aggregation module collects data from multiple sensors and aggregates it into a single packet, reducing the number of packets transmitted over the network. The data compression module compresses the aggregated data using a lossless compression algorithm, further reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. The compressed data is then transmitted over the network using a low-power wireless communication protocol.

The performance of the proposed protocol was evaluated using a simulation-based approach. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol reduces energy consumption by up to 70% compared to traditional WBAN protocols. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the proposed protocol maintains accurate health monitoring capabilities, with an average error rate of less than 5%.

The implications of this study are significant, as the proposed energy-efficient protocol can be used to extend the battery life of WBAN devices, enabling continuous health monitoring without the need for frequent battery replacements. This can lead to improved patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and enhanced quality of life for individuals with chronic diseases. Furthermore, the proposed protocol can be used in various applications, including wearable devices, implantable devices, and IoT-based health monitoring systems.

However, the energy efficiency of WBANs remains a significant challenge, as the limited battery life of these devices restricts their continuous operation.

This paper presents an energy-efficient health monitoring approach using WBANs. The proposed approach focuses on minimizing the energy consumption of WBANs while ensuring accurate and reliable health monitoring. The methodology employed in this study involves the design and implementation of a novel energy-efficient protocol for WBANs. This protocol utilizes a combination of data aggregation and compression techniques to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network, thereby minimizing energy consumption.

The proposed protocol consists of two main components: a data aggregation module and a data compression module. The data aggregation module collects data from multiple sensors and aggregates it into a single packet, reducing the number of packets transmitted over the network. The data compression module compresses the aggregated data using a lossless compression algorithm, further reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. The compressed data is then transmitted over the network using a low-power wireless communication protocol.

The performance of the proposed protocol was evaluated using a simulation-based approach. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol reduces energy consumption by up to 70% compared to traditional WBAN protocols. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the proposed protocol maintains accurate health monitoring capabilities, with an average error rate of less than 5%.

The implications of this study are significant, as the proposed energy-efficient protocol can be used to extend the battery life of WBAN devices, enabling continuous health monitoring without the need for frequent battery replacements. This can lead to improved patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and enhanced quality of life for individuals with chronic diseases.

The absorption of free linear chains in a polymer brush was studied with respect to ","The absorption of free linear chains in a polymer brush was studied with respect to chain size $L$ and compatibility $\chi$ with the brush by means of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and Density Functional Theory (DFT) / Self-Consistent Field Theory (SCFT) at both moderate, $\sigma_g = 0.25$, and high, $\sigma_g = 1.00$, grafting densities using a bead-spring model.

Different concentrations of the free chains $0.0625 \le \phi_o \le 0.375$ are examined. Contrary to the case of $\chi = 0$ when all species are almost completely ejected by the polymer brush irrespective of their length $L$, for $\chi < 0$ we find that the degree of absorption (absorbed amount) $\Gamma(L)$ undergoes a sharp crossover from weak to strong ($\approx 100%$) absorption, discriminating between oligomers, $1\le L\le 8$, and longer chains. For a moderately dense brush, $\sigma_g = 0.25$, the longer species, $L > 8$, populate predominantly the deep inner part of the brush whereas in a dense brush $\sigma_g = 1.00$ they penetrate into the ""fluffy"" tail of the dense brush only. Gyration radius $R_g$ and end-to-end distance $R_e$ of absorbed chains thereby scale with length $L$ as free polymers in the bulk. Using both MC and DFT/SCFT methods for brushes of different chain length $32 \le N \le 256$, we demonstrate the existence of unique {\em critical} value of compatibility $\chi = \chi^{c}<0$. For $\chi^{c}(\phi_o)$ the energy of free chains attains the {\em same} value, irrespective of length $L$ whereas the entropy of free chain displays a pronounced minimum. At $\chi^{c}$ all density profiles of absorbing chains with different $L$ intersect at the same distance from the grafting plane. The penetration/expulsion kinetics of free chains into the polymer brush after an instantaneous change in their compatibility $\chi$ displays a rather rich behavior. We find three distinct regimes of penetration kinetics of free chains regarding the length $L$: I ($1\le L\le 8$), II ($8 \le L \le N$), and III ($L > N$), in which the time of absorption $\tau$ grows with $L$ at a different rate. During the initial stages of penetration into the brush one observes a power-law increase of $\Gamma \propto t^\alpha$ with power $\alpha \propto -\ln \phi_o$ whereby penetration of the free chains into the brush gets {\em slower} as their concentration rises.","(511, 11)","The absorption and expulsion of oligomers and linear macromolecules in a polymer brush have been the subject of extensive research. This phenomenon occurs due to the interaction between the brush and the surrounding environment, resulting in changes in the conformation of the polymer chains. In this paper, we analyze the factors that affect the kinetics and thermodynamics of these processes, and their impact on the physical and chemical properties of the system.

One of the key factors that govern the absorption and expulsion of macromolecules in a polymer brush is the strength of the adhesive interactions between the brush and the solvent. The strength of these interactions depends on a variety of factors, such as the chemical nature of the brush and solvent, the temperature, and the concentration of solutes. A detailed understanding of the thermodynamics of these interactions is critical for the design of new materials with tailored solvation properties.

Another important variable is the molecular weight and size of the macromolecules that are being absorbed or expelled. For example, linear chains may have different absorption and expulsion kinetics than branched or cyclic polymers, due to differences in their shape and flexibility. Similarly, the size and shape of the pores or defects in the brush structure can affect the rate of mass transfer, and thus, the absorption and expulsion kinetics.

In this paper, we present a theoretical model that describes the absorption and expulsion of macromolecules in a polymer brush. The model takes into account the key variables that affect mass transfer, such as the concentration gradient, the diffusion coefficient of the solutes, the porosity of the brush, and the strength of the adhesive interactions. Our results show that the kinetics and thermodynamics of the process are strongly dependent on these variables, and provide insights into the factors that can be used to tune the solvation properties of the brush.

Finally, we discuss the potential applications of polymer brushes with tailored solvation properties, such as in drug delivery, chromatography, and sensors. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to design new materials that exhibit enhanced selectivity, sensitivity, and efficiency in a wide range of applications. Overall, our study provides a fundamental understanding of the absorption and expulsion of macromolecules in a polymer brush, and opens up new directions for the development of novel materials with tailored solvation properties.","(431, 15)","The absorption of free linear chains in a polymer brush was studied with respect to ionic and non-ionic oligomers and linear macromolecules. This study aimed to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms governing the interactions between the polymer brush and the absorbed molecules, as well as the effects of molecular weight, charge, and solvent quality on the absorption process.

To address this research question, a series of experiments were conducted using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to measure the adsorption isotherms and chain conformations of the absorbed molecules. The polymer brush was synthesized via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) and characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

The results showed that the absorption of ionic oligomers was significantly influenced by the charge density of the polymer brush, with higher charge densities leading to increased adsorption. In contrast, the absorption of non-ionic linear macromolecules was found to be largely independent of the polymer brush's charge density. The molecular weight of the absorbed molecules also played a crucial role, with higher molecular weights resulting in reduced adsorption due to increased steric hindrance.

Furthermore, the solvent quality was found to have a profound impact on the absorption process, with good solvent conditions leading to enhanced adsorption and poor solvent conditions resulting in decreased adsorption. The AFM measurements revealed that the absorbed molecules exhibited a range of conformations, from highly stretched to highly compact, depending on the molecular weight and solvent quality.

The DLS measurements provided valuable insights into the dynamics of the absorbed molecules, showing that the relaxation times of the chains increased with increasing molecular weight and decreasing solvent quality.

(abridged) We studied the energy and frequency dependence of the Fourier time lags and intrinsic ","(abridged) We studied the energy and frequency dependence of the Fourier time lags and intrinsic coherence of the kHz QPOs in the NS LMXBs 4U 1608-52 and 4U 1636-53 using RXTE data. In both sources we confirmed energy-dependent soft lags of 10-100 \mu s for the lower kHz QPO. We also found that the time lags of the upper kHz QPO are independent of energy and inconsistent with the soft lags of the lower kHz QPO. The intrinsic coherence of the lower kHz QPO remains constant at 0.6 from 5 to 12 keV, and then drops to zero, while for the upper kHz QPO the intrinsic coherence is consistent with zero across the full energy range. The intrinsic coherence of the upper kHz QPO is consistent with zero over the full frequency range of the QPO, except in 4U 1636-53 at ~780 Hz where it increases to 0.13. In 4U 1636-53, for the lower kHz QPO the 4-12 keV photons lag the 12-20 keV ones by 25 \mu s in the QPO frequency range 500-850 Hz, with the lags decreasing to 15 \mu s at higher frequencies. In 4U 1608-52 the soft lags of the lower kHz QPO remain constant at 40 \mu s. In 4U 1636-53, for the upper kHz QPO the 12-20 keV photons lag the 4-12 keV ones by 11 +/- 3 \mu s, independent of QPO frequency; we found consistent results for the time lags of the upper kHz QPO in 4U 1608-52. The intrinsic coherence of the lower kHz QPO increases from ~0-0.4 at 600 Hz to 1 and 0.6 at 800 Hz in 4U 1636-53 and 4U 1608-52, respectively. In 4U 1636-53 it decreases to 0.5 at 920 Hz, while in 4U 1608-52 we do not have data above 800 Hz. We discuss our results in the context of scenarios in which the soft lags are either due to reflection off the accretion disc or up-/down-scattering in a hot medium close to the neutron star. We finally explore the connection between, on one hand the time lags and the intrinsic coherence of the kHz QPOs, and on the other the QPOs' amplitude and quality factor in these two sources.","(391, 11)","This research paper studies the time lags of kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations in the low-mass X-ray binaries 4U 1608-52 and 4U 1636-53. These phenomena are observed in neutron stars and are important for understanding the behavior and properties of these systems. The data was gathered through the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite, which provided high-precision light curves of these binaries. The time lags were measured using Fourier spectral analysis and time lag spectra. A comparison was made between the time lags of different frequencies and the energy spectra to determine the correlations between them.

The results show that the time lags are present in both 4U 1608-52 and 4U 1636-53, indicating that these quasi-periodic oscillations are a common feature of low-mass X-ray binaries. The time lags were found to be dependent on the frequency and energy of the oscillations. The time lags at lower frequencies were larger than those at higher frequencies. It was also found that the energy dependence of the time lags was different for the two binaries. These results suggest that the time lags may be produced by different mechanisms in each binary.

To investigate this further, a spectral analysis was performed to determine the energy spectra of both binaries. The results showed that the energy spectra of 4U 1608-52 and 4U 1636-53 are similar, but differ in the details of their shape and parameters. These differences may be related to the different mechanisms responsible for the time lags in each binary.

The study of time lags in kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations can provide important insights into the physics of neutron stars and help us understand the fundamental properties of these systems.

The kHz QPOs are believed to originate from the innermost regions of the accretion disk surrounding the compact object, and their study can provide valuable insights into the physical processes occurring in these systems.

Our analysis was based on data collected by the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) onboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite. We used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the kHz QPOs, and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to calculate the time lags between different energy bands. The time lags were then analyzed as a function of energy and frequency to investigate their dependence on these parameters.

We found that the time lags of the upper kHz QPO (uQPO) in both sources exhibit a positive correlation with energy, indicating that the uQPO originates from a region closer to the compact object than the lower kHz QPO (lQPO). This result is consistent with the ""hot inner accretion flow"" (HIAF) model, where the uQPO is produced in a hot, optically thin region near the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), while the lQPO is generated in a cooler, optically thick region further out in the disk.

In addition, we observed a negative correlation between the time lags and the frequency of the lQPO in both sources, suggesting that the lQPO frequency is inversely proportional to the mass of the compact object. This result supports the ""diskoseismology"" model, where the lQPOs are caused by density waves propagating through the disk, and the frequency of these waves is determined by the mass and spin of the compact object.

Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the physics of LMXBs.

The M vs T curve shows a broad peak around T = 160 K. The anisotropy constant, K$_1$, estimated at T = 300 K, is 0.25 MJ/m$^3$. Theoretical analysis of Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ system has been carried out and extended to the full range of Fe$_5$Si$_{1-x}$P$_x$B$_2$, Fe$_5$P$_{1-x}$S$_x$B$_2$, and (Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_5$SiB$_2$ compositions. The electronic band structures have been calculated using the Full-Potential Local-Orbital Minimum-Basis Scheme (FPLO-14). The calculated total magnetic moments are 9.20, 9.15, 9.59 and 2.42$\mu_B$ per formula units of Fe$_5$SiB$_2$, Fe$_5$PB$_2$, Fe$_5$SB$_2$, and Co$_5$SiB$_2$, respectively. In agreement with experiment, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE's) calculated for T = 0 K changes from a negative (easy-plane) anisotropy -0.28 MJ/m$^3$ for Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ to the positive (easy-axis) anisotropy 0.35 MJ/m$^3$ for Fe$_5$PB$_2$. Further increase of the number of p-electrons in Fe$_5$P$_{1-x}$S$_x$B$_2$ leads to an increase of MAE up to 0.77 MJ/m$^3$ for the hypothetical Fe$_5$P$_{0.4}$S$_{0.6}$B$_2$ composition. Volume variation and fixed spin moment calculations (FSM) performed for Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ show an inverse relation between MAE and magnetic moment in the region down to about 15\% reduction of the spin moment. The alloying of Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ with Co is proposed as a practical realization of magnetic moment reduction, which ought to increase MAE. MAE calculated in virtual crystal approximation (VCA) for a full range of (Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_5$SiB$_2$ compositions reaches the maximum value of 1.16 MJ/m$^3$ at Co concentration x = 0.3, with the magnetic moment 7.75$\mu_B$ per formula unit.

We conducted a comprehensive characterization of the samples using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and Mössbauer spectroscopy (MS). The XRD patterns confirmed the formation of the Fe$_5$SiB$_2$ phase as the major component, and the presence of secondary phases of Fe-based and phosphate, sulfide, or carbide compounds. The SEM images revealed a fine-grained and homogeneous microstructure for the undoped sample and a coarser and segmented microstructure for the doped samples.

The samples were prepared by arc-melting high-purity elements in an argon atmosphere and then annealing at 1000°C for 24 hours. The composition of the samples was verified using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The magnetic properties of the alloys were investigated by substituting P, S, or Co into the Fe$_5$ SiB$_2$ lattice. The results show that the substitution of P or S leads to a decrease in the saturation magnetization, while the substitution of Co results in an increase. The effective magnetic moment and the Curie temperature are also affected by the substitution. The magnetic anisotropy of the alloys was studied by measuring the magnetization as a function of the angle between the applied field and the crystallographic axes. The results indicate that the magnetic easy axis is along the c-axis for all the alloys. The magnetic hardness of the alloys was evaluated by measuring the coercivity, H$_{\text{c}}$, which was found to be highest for the Co-substituted alloy.

In this paper, we describe a scheme for propagating belief functions in certain kinds of ","In this paper, we describe a scheme for propagating belief functions in certain kinds of trees using only local computations. This scheme generalizes the computational scheme proposed by Shafer and Logan1 for diagnostic trees of the type studied by Gordon and Shortliffe, and the slightly more general scheme given by Shafer for hierarchical evidence. It also generalizes the scheme proposed by Pearl for Bayesian causal trees (see Shenoy and Shafer). Pearl's causal trees and Gordon and Shortliffe's diagnostic trees are both ways of breaking the evidence that bears on a large problem down into smaller items of evidence that bear on smaller parts of the problem so that these smaller problems can be dealt with one at a time. This localization of effort is often essential in order to make the process of probability judgment feasible, both for the person who is making probability judgments and for the machine that is combining them. The basic structure for our scheme is a type of tree that generalizes both Pearl's and Gordon and Shortliffe's trees. Trees of this general type permit localized computation in Pearl's sense. They are based on qualitative judgments of conditional independence. We believe that the scheme we describe here will prove useful in expert systems. It is now clear that the successful propagation of probabilities or certainty factors in expert systems requires much more structure than can be provided in a pure production-system framework. Bayesian schemes, on the other hand, often make unrealistic demands for structure. The propagation of belief functions in trees and more general networks stands on a middle ground where some sensible and useful things can be done. We would like to emphasize that the basic idea of local computation for propagating probabilities is due to Judea Pearl. It is a very innovative idea; we do not believe that it can be found in the Bayesian literature prior to Pearl's work. We see our contribution as extending the usefulness of Pearl's idea by generalizing it from Bayesian probabilities to belief functions. In the next section, we give a brief introduction to belief functions. The notions of qualitative independence for partitions and a qualitative Markov tree are introduced in Section III. Finally, in Section IV, we describe a scheme for propagating belief functions in qualitative Markov trees.","(417, 18)","The propagation of belief functions has been traditionally approached in centralized settings. However, with the advent of decentralized systems, a distributed approach to propagate belief functions becomes desirable. This paper proposes a novel distributed algorithm to propagate belief functions in a decentralized environment.

The proposed algorithm leverages a combination of techniques from graph theory, optimization, and machine learning to efficiently and accurately propagate belief functions. The algorithm consists of two phases: the first phase involves constructing a graph-based representation of the belief functions, while the second phase involves the actual propagation of the belief functions over the graph.

The graph-based representation of belief functions is constructed using a probabilistic graphical model, which allows for capturing the dependencies between different factors that influence the belief functions. The constructed model is then optimized using a combination of convex optimization techniques and machine learning algorithms, which enables efficient and accurate propagation of the belief functions.

The algorithm's efficiency is guaranteed through the use of a distributed consensus protocol that allows for nodes to share information and reach agreement on the propagated belief functions. Moreover, the algorithm is designed to be fault-tolerant, meaning that it can handle node failures and network partitions, ensuring reliable and robust belief function propagation.

We evaluate the proposed algorithm using various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its efficacy in accurately propagating belief functions in a distributed setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate the algorithm's scalability by testing it on increasingly larger datasets, showing that it can handle a high number of nodes and edges efficiently.

Overall, the proposed distributed approach to propagate belief functions represents a significant advancement in the field of decentralized systems. The algorithm's efficacy, scalability, and fault-tolerance make it a promising solution for various applications that require the propagation of belief functions, such as sensor networks, social networks, and decision-making systems.","(337, 13)","In this paper, we describe a scheme for propagating belief functions in certain kinds of  probabilistic graphical models using a distributed approach.

Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithm called Distributed Belief Propagation (DBP) that enables the efficient and scalable propagation of belief functions across a network of interconnected nodes. Each node in the network represents a variable or a set of variables in the probabilistic graphical model, and the DBP algorithm allows these nodes to exchange information and update their local belief functions in a decentralized manner.

The DBP algorithm consists of two main components: a local update rule and a message-passing protocol. The local update rule enables each node to update its local belief function based on the information received from its neighbors, while the message-passing protocol governs the exchange of information between nodes. We show that the DBP algorithm converges to the correct solution under certain conditions and provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence properties.

To evaluate the performance of the DBP algorithm, we conducted extensive experiments on a variety of probabilistic graphical models, including Bayesian networks, Markov random fields, and conditional random fields.

The connected system of Boltzman equations for the interacting system of electrons, positrons and photons ","The connected system of Boltzman equations for the interacting system of electrons, positrons and photons in high external electric E and arbitrary magnetic H fields is solved. The consideration is made under the conditions of arbitrary heating and the mutual drag of carriers and photons.

The non-stationary and non-uniform distribution function (DF) of photons for the all considered cases is obtained. It is shown that the DF of photons have the stationary limit for the drift velocities $(\overset{\to }\to{u}\overset{\to}\to{q}/\hbar \omega_q) <1$ and becomes exponentially grown by the time for the drift velocities $(\overset{\to}\to{u}\overset{\to}\to{q}/\hbar \omega_q) \geq 1$. It is shown that the mutual drag of carriers and photons leads to the formation of ''quasi-particles''\_ the ''electron dressed by photons'' and ''positron dressed by photons'', i.e. the mutual drag plays the role of the dressing mechanism of carriers and leads to the renormalization of the mass and frequency of photons.

As a result of analyses of the phenomena of connected by the mutual drag system of carriers and photons we receive some fundamental results: a) the finiteness of the mass of photon (i.e. the rest mass of photons do not equal to zero); b) reality of takhyons as a quasi-particles with the real mass in amplifying system (or regime); c) identity of the mechanism of relativity and the Doppler effect which coincides with the renormalization of frequency or mass as a result of the mutual drag of carriers and photons at external field (force). These conclusions were received as a result of the fact that the relativistic factor enters to the expressions of the DF of photons and other physical expressions in the first order in the form $[ 1-(u^2/c^2) ] ^{-1}$, instead the $[ 1-(u^2/c^2) ] ^{-1/2}$ in Einstein theory. It is shown that the relativistic effect of deceleration of time really taking place for the relaxation time of carriers or for the life time of carriers, or for the period of electromagnetic oscillations. The latest is a direct result of the Doppler effect. Also it is shown that the velocity of light is an averaged velocity of photons at the ground state, as well as a velocity of sound for the phonons.","(456, 12)","This research paper presents a theoretical model for the interacting system of electrons, positrons, and photons in high external electric and arbitrary magnetic fields. We investigate the complex dynamics of these particles under such extreme conditions using perturbation theory and numerical simulations. Our results reveal novel physical phenomena, such as the generation of electron-positron pairs due to the strong electric field and the emergence of Landau levels in the presence of a magnetic field. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of photon emission and absorption on the dynamics of the charged particles.

We show that the energy and momentum conservation laws in our system are valid, verifying the reliability of our theoretical approach. We also investigate the impact of magnetic field strength and angle on the motion of particles. Our analysis demonstrates the critical influence of magnetic field components on the electron trajectories, causing them to spiral and change direction. Additionally, we observe that the emission of photons results in a decrease of energy for the particles, ultimately leading to their capture by the external fields.

Moreover, we explore the significance of electron-positron pair production and their subsequent annihilation. Our results indicate the formation of a regular pattern of pairs along the direction of the electric field. These pairs influence other electrons, creating a more complicated system, which we investigate using higher-order perturbation theory and numerical simulations. We observe fascinating effects of photon emission and absorption on the dynamics of the particles, including the possibility of particle acceleration and deceleration.

On Zariski Main Theorem in Algebraic Geometry and Analytic Geometry. We fill a surprising gap ","On Zariski Main Theorem in Algebraic Geometry and Analytic Geometry. We fill a surprising gap of Complex Analytic Geometry by proving the analogue of Zariski Main Theorem in this geometry, i.e. proving that an holomorphic map from an irreducible analytic space to a normal irreducible one is an open embedding if and only if all its fibers are discrete and it induces a bimeromorphic map on its image. We prove more generally the ""Generalized Zariski Main Theorem for analytic spaces"", which claims that an holomorphic map from an irreducible analytic space to a irreducible locally irreducible one is an open embedding if and only if it is flat and induces a bimeromorphic map on its image. Thanks to the ""analytic criterion of regularity"" of Serre-Samuel in GAGA [12] and to ""Lefschetz Principle"", we finally deduce the ""Generalized Zariski Main Theorem for algebraic varieties of characteristical zero"", which claims that a morphism from such an irreducible variety to an irreducible unibranch one is an open immersion if and only if it is birational and flat.

In the algebraic setting, we consider the Zariski topology, a topology in which closed sets are defined by the vanishing of certain polynomials. We demonstrate how the Zariski Main Theorem is a crucial tool in the study of algebraic varieties, as it allows for the identification of open sets which are isomorphic to affine spaces.

In the analytic setting, we consider the classical notion of analytic sets, and define the notion of a proper map between such sets. We then show how the Zariski Main Theorem can be used to provide a characterization of proper maps.

We fill a surprising gap  in our understanding of the interplay between algebraic geometry and analytic geometry by providing a novel proof of the Zariski main theorem, a fundamental result in algebraic geometry that has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the relationship between these two fields. This theorem, first proven by Oscar Zariski in the 1940s, establishes a deep connection between the geometric and algebraic properties of algebraic varieties, and has had a profound impact on the development of modern algebraic geometry.

Our proof relies on a combination of techniques from algebraic geometry, analytic geometry, and commutative algebra, and provides a fresh perspective on the relationship between these fields. We begin by establishing a series of key lemmas, each of which provides a crucial insight into the structure of algebraic varieties. We then use these lemmas to prove a series of intermediate theorems, each of which builds on the previous one to provide a more complete understanding of the relationships between algebraic and analytic geometry.

Cells have evolved a metabolic control of DNA replication to respond to a wide range ","Cells have evolved a metabolic control of DNA replication to respond to a wide range of nutritional conditions. Accumulating data suggest that this poorly understood control depends, at least in part, on Central Carbon Metabolism (CCM). In Bacillus subtilis , the glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PykA) is intricately linked to replication. This 585 amino-acid-long enzyme comprises a catalytic (Cat) domain that binds to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP to produce pyruvate and ATP, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function.

Interestingly, the C-terminal domain termed PEPut interacts with Cat and is homologous a domain that, in other metabolic enzymes, are phosphorylated at a conserved TSH motif at the expense of PEP and ATP to drive sugar import and catalytic or regulatory activities. To gain insights into the role of PykA in replication, DNA synthesis was analyzed in various Cat and PEPut mutants grown in a medium where the metabolic activity of PykA is dispensable for growth.

Measurements of replication parameters ( ori/ter ratio, C period and fork speed) and of the pyruvate kinase activity showed that PykA mutants exhibit replication defects resulting from side chain modifications in the PykA protein rather than from a reduction of its metabolic activity. Interestingly, Cat and PEPut have distinct commitments in replication: while Cat impacts positively and negatively replication fork speed, PEPut stimulates initiation through a process depending on Cat-PEPut interaction and growth conditions. Residues binding to PEP and ADP in Cat, stabilizing the Cat-PEPut interaction and belonging to the TSH motif of PEPut were found important for the commitment of PykA in replication. In vitro , PykA affects the activities of replication enzymes (the polymerase DnaE, helicase DnaC and primase DnaG) essential for initiation and elongation and genetically linked to pykA . Our results thus connect replication initiation and elongation to CCM metabolites (PEP, ATP and ADP), critical Cat and PEPut residues and to multiple links between PykA and the replication enzymes DnaE, DnaC and DnaG. We propose that PykA is endowed with a moonlighting activity that senses the concentration of signaling metabolites and interacts with replication enzymes to convey information on the cellular metabolic state to the replication machinery and adjust replication initiation and elongation to metabolism. This defines a new type of replication regulator proposed to be part of the metabolic control that gates replication in the cell cycle.","(427, 13)","Glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PK) is an enzyme well known for its critical role in energy metabolism through catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, resulting in ATP synthesis. However, novel findings have shown that PK also plays a non-glycolytic role in DNA replication initiation and elongation.

In the context of DNA replication, PK interacts with various proteins and participates in the formation of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) and replication forks, demonstrating its significance in DNA synthesis and cell division. Specifically, PK has been found to directly bind and activate the pre-RC initiator protein Cdc6, promoting the assembly of the pre-RC in a manner dependent on its kinase activity. Moreover, PK has been observed to interact with the DNA polymerase alpha complex and regulate its activity, indicating its role in regulating DNA synthesis.

In addition, PK has also been implicated in DNA damage response and repair. Specifically, PK can phosphorylate the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein in response to DNA damage, promoting the activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk2 and consequently leading to cell cycle arrest. Notably, PK-mediated ATM phosphorylation occurs in a DNA damage-dependent manner and provides a link between metabolism and DNA damage response.

Overall, the moonlighting activities of PK in DNA replication initiation, elongation, and DNA damage response represent a novel and exciting area of research with the potential to elucidate our current understanding of cellular metabolism and DNA synthesis. Despite recent advances, further studies are necessary to determine the precise mechanisms through which PK regulates replication and DNA damage response and to investigate the potential of PK as a target for cancer therapy.","(302, 10)","Cells have evolved a metabolic control of DNA replication to respond to a wide range  of internal and external signals.

These studies revealed a direct interaction between PK and the minichromosome maintenance protein 2 (MCM2), a key component of the pre-replicative complex.

We next investigated the effect of PK on DNA replication using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro DNA replication assays revealed that PK stimulated DNA replication in a concentration-dependent manner, with maximal stimulation observed at 100 nM PK. In contrast, higher concentrations of PK inhibited DNA replication, suggesting a biphasic response to PK activity. In vivo studies using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed these findings, showing that PK overexpression stimulated DNA replication, while PK knockdown inhibited DNA replication.

This article is devoted to the study of the following semilinear equation with measure data ","This article is devoted to the study of the following semilinear equation with measure data which originates in the gravitational Maxwell gauged $O(3)$ sigma model, $$-\Delta u + A_0(\prod^k_{j=1}|x-p_j|^{2n_j} )^{-a} \frac{e^u}{(1+e^u)^{1+a}} = 4\pi\sum_{j=1}^k n_j\delta_{p_j} - 4\pi\sum^l_{j=1}m_j\delta_{q_j} \quad{\rm in}\;\; \mathbb{R}^2.\qquad(E)$$ In this equation the $\{\delta_{p_j}\}_{j=1}^k$ (resp. $\{\delta_{q_j}\}_{j=1}^l$ ) are Dirac masses concentrated at the points $\{p_j\}_{j=1}^k$, (resp.

$\{q_j\}_{j=1}^l$), $n_j$ and $m_j$ are positive integers, and $a$ is a nonnegative real number. We set $ N=\sum^k_{j=1}n_j $ and $M= \sum^l_{j=1}m_j$.

In previous works \cite{C,Y2}, some qualitative properties of solutions of $(E)$ with $a=0$ have been established. Our aim in this article is to study the more general case where $a>0$. The additional difficulties of this case come from the fact that the nonlinearity is no longer monotone and the data are signed measures. As a consequence we cannot anymore construct directly the solutions by the monotonicity method combined with the supersolutions and subsolutions technique. Instead we develop a new and self-contained approach which enables us to emphasize the role played by the gravitation in the gauged $O(3)$ sigma model. Without the gravitational term, i.e. if $a=0$, problem $(E)$ has a layer's structure of solutions $\{u_\beta\}_{\beta\in(-2(N-M),\, -2]}$, where $u_\beta$ is the unique non-topological solution such that $u_{\beta}=\beta\ln |x|+O(1)$ for $-2(N-M)<\beta<-2$ and $u_{-2}=-2\ln |x|-2\ln\ln |x|+O(1)$ at infinity respectively. On the contrary, when $a>0$, the set of solutions to problem $(E)$ has a much richer structure: besides the topological solutions, there exists a sequence of non-topological solutions in type I, i.e. such that $u $ tends to $-\infty$ at infinity, and of non-topological solutions of type II, which tend to $\infty$ at infinity. The existence of these types of solutions depends on the values of the parameters $N,\, M,\, \beta$ and on the gravitational interaction associated to $a$.","(549, 14)","In this paper, we investigate the qualitative properties of solutions to semilinear elliptic equations arising from the gravitational Maxwell gauged O(3) sigma model. The model under consideration is a natural extension of the well-known O(3) sigma model, in which a gauge field is introduced to couple to the Maxwell field. We show that the solutions to the semilinear elliptic equations exhibit a surprising range of behaviors, depending on the values of certain parameters in the model.

Our analysis begins with a detailed study of the model's energy functional, which is given by a sum of kinetic and potential terms. We use variational methods to derive necessary conditions for the existence of solutions to the semilinear elliptic equations, and we prove the local and global existence of solutions under suitable assumptions. We then investigate the stability of these solutions under small perturbations, using energy estimates and a perturbation argument.

Our results have significant implications for the understanding of the dynamics of the gravitational Maxwell gauged O(3) sigma model. In particular, we find that the solutions can display a variety of qualitative behaviors, including concentration of energy, symmetry breaking, and blow-up. We also show that the solutions can be used to construct interesting physical quantities, such as solitons and vortices. Furthermore, our analysis provides insights into the relationship between the O(3) sigma model and the gravitational Maxwell gauged O(3) sigma model, and suggests possible avenues for future research.

Overall, our work contributes to the ongoing study of non-linear partial differential equations, and demonstrates the importance of understanding the qualitative properties of solutions to these equations in the context of physical models. Our results pave the way for new developments in the theory of soliton solutions, and suggest new ways of characterizing the behavior of complicated physical systems.","(339, 12)","This article is devoted to the study of the following semilinear equation with measure data  \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u = f(x,u,\nabla u) + \mu &amp; \mbox{in } \Omega, \\ u = 0 &amp;\mbox{on } \partial \Omega, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*}

This paper presents a model of capital accumulation for a large number of heterogenous producer-consumers ","This paper presents a model of capital accumulation for a large number of heterogenous producer-consumers in an exchange space in which interactions depend on agents' positions. Each agent is described by his production, consumption, stock of capital, as well as the position he occupies in this abstract space. Each agent produces one differentiated good whose price is fixed by market clearing conditions. Production functions are Cobb-Douglas, and capital stocks follow the standard capital accumulation dynamic equation.

Agents consume all goods but have a preference for goods produced by their closest neighbors. Agents in the exchange space are subject both to attractive and repulsive forces. Exchanges drive agents closer, but beyond a certain level of proximity, agents will tend to crowd out more distant agents. The present model uses a formalism based on statistical field theory developed earlier by the authors. This approach allows the analytical treatment of economic models with an arbitrary number of agents, while preserving the system's interactions and complexity at the individual level. Our results show that the dynamics of capital accumulation and agents' position in the exchange space are correlated.

Interactions in the exchange space induce several phases of the system. A first phase appears when attractive forces are limited. In this phase, an initial central position in the exchange space favors capital accumulation in average and leads to a higher level of capital, while agents far from the center will experience a slower accumulation process. A high level of initial capital drives agents towards a central position, i.e. improve the terms of their exchanges: they experience a higher demand and higher prices for their product.

As usual, high capital productivity favors capital accumulation, while higher rates of capital depreciation reduce capital stock. In a second phase, attractive forces are predominant. The previous results remain, but an additional threshold effect appears. Even though no restriction was imposed initially on the system, two types of agents emerge, depending on their initial stock of capital. One type of agents will remain above the capital threshold and occupy and benefit from a central position. The other type will remain below the threshold, will not be able to break it and will remain at the periphery of the exchange space. In this phase, capital distribution is less homogenous than in the first phase.","(427, 22)","The accumulation of capital is a topic of great interest to economists, and many different models and approaches have been developed over the years. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of statistical field theory as a way of analyzing the dynamics of capital accumulation. This approach provides a powerful tool for understanding the complex interactions between different economic agents, and for predicting the behavior of the system as a whole.

At its core, statistical field theory is a mathematical framework that allows us to describe the evolution of a system of interacting particles. Instead of treating each individual particle separately, the approach focuses on the underlying statistical distributions governing the behavior of the system as a whole. This makes it particularly well-suited for studying complex systems such as the economy.

In the case of capital accumulation, the statistical field approach allows us to model the interaction between different firms and investors in a dynamic way. By treating the economy as a statistical field, we can capture the patterns of investment and growth that emerge from the interactions between different agents. This can help us to understand the underlying dynamics of the system, and to make predictions about the behavior of the economy in the future.

One of the key advantages of the statistical field approach is its ability to represent the complex patterns of feedback and interaction that occur in the economy. This includes the interdependence between different sectors of the economy, the effects of regulations and policy decisions, and the impact of external shocks such as changes in trade policy or natural disasters. By accounting for these factors in a dynamic way, the approach allows us to build models that are more realistic and robust than traditional static models.

Overall, the statistical field approach to capital accumulation represents a promising avenue for future research in this area. By providing a powerful tool for modeling the behavior of complex economic systems, it has the potential to help us better understand the underlying dynamics of capital accumulation and to make more accurate predictions about the future behavior of the economy. However, further research will be needed to refine and improve the approach, particularly in the context of real-world economic systems with their many idiosyncrasies and complexities.","(411, 15)","This paper presents a model of capital accumulation for a large number of heterogenous producer-consumers  using a statistical field approach. The goal of this research is to develop a framework that can accurately capture the complex dynamics of capital accumulation in a multi-agent system, taking into account the interactions between individual agents and the aggregate behavior of the system as a whole.

The proposed model is based on the concept of a statistical field, which represents the collective behavior of a large number of interacting agents. In this context, the statistical field is used to describe the distribution of capital among the agents, as well as the flow of capital between them. The model is formulated using a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the evolution of the capital distribution over time.

The PDEs are derived from a set of assumptions about the behavior of individual agents, including their investment decisions, consumption patterns, and interactions with other agents. These assumptions are based on a combination of theoretical and empirical insights from economics, sociology, and physics. The PDEs are then solved numerically using a finite difference method, which allows for the simulation of the capital accumulation process over a wide range of parameters and initial conditions.

The results of the simulations show that the model is able to capture a wide range of phenomena associated with capital accumulation, including the emergence of wealth inequality, the formation of economic clusters, and the impact of external shocks on the system. The model also reproduces some of the key features of real-world economies, such as the Pareto distribution of wealth and the presence of power-law tails in the distribution of capital.

One of the key findings of this research is that the statistical field approach provides a more accurate and robust description of capital accumulation than traditional models based on mean-field approximations. This is because the statistical field approach takes into account the spatial and temporal correlations between individual agents, which are essential for capturing the complex dynamics of the system.

The implications of this research are far-reaching and have significant implications for our understanding of capital accumulation and economic development. The model provides a new framework for analyzing the dynamics of wealth inequality and the impact of economic policies on the distribution of capital. It also offers a new perspective on the role of innovation and technological change in driving economic growth and capital accumulation.

The goal of this research is to develop a framework that can accurately capture the complex dynamics of capital accumulation in a multi-agent system, taking into account the interactions between individual agents and the aggregate behavior of the system as a whole.

The proposed model is based on the concept of a statistical field, which represents the collective behavior of a large number of interacting agents. In this context, the statistical field is used to describe the distribution of capital among the agents, as well as the flow of capital between them. The model is formulated using a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the evolution of the capital distribution over time.

The PDEs are derived from a set of assumptions about the behavior of individual agents, including their investment decisions, consumption patterns, and interactions with other agents. These assumptions are based on a combination of theoretical and empirical insights from economics, sociology, and physics. The PDEs are then solved numerically using a finite difference method, which allows for the simulation of the capital accumulation process over a wide range of parameters and initial conditions.

The results of the simulations show that the model is able to capture a wide range of phenomena associated with capital accumulation, including the emergence of wealth inequality, the formation of economic clusters, and the impact of external shocks on the system. The model also reproduces some of the key features of real-world economies, such as the Pareto distribution of wealth and the presence of power-law tails in the distribution of capital.

One of the key findings of this research is that the statistical field approach provides a more accurate and robust description of capital accumulation than traditional models based on mean-field approximations. This is because the statistical field approach takes into account the spatial and temporal correlations between individual agents, which are essential for capturing the complex dynamics of the system.

The implications of this research are far-reaching and have significant implications for our understanding of capital accumulation and economic development. The model provides a new framework for analyzing the dynamics of wealth inequality and the impact of economic policies on the distribution of capital. It also offers a new perspective on the role of innovation and technological change in driving economic growth and capital accumulation.

Furthermore, the statistical field approach can be applied to a wide range of fields beyond economics, including sociology, biology, and physics. This research has the potential to shed new light on the complex dynamics of social and biological systems, and to provide new insights into the behavior of complex systems in general.

Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$, and let ","Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$, and let $d(u,w)$ denote the length of a $u-w$ geodesic in $G$. For any $v\in V(G)$ and $e=xy\in E(G)$, let $d(e,v)=\min\{d(x,v),d(y,v)\}$. For distinct $e_1, e_2\in E(G)$, let $R\{e_1,e_2\}=\{z\in V(G):d(z,e_1)\neq d(z,e_2)\}$. Kelenc et al.

[Discrete Appl. Math. 251 (2018) 204-220] introduced the edge dimension of a graph: A vertex subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ is an edge resolving set of $G$ if $|S\cap R\{e_1,e_2\}|\ge 1$ for any distinct $e_1, e_2\in E(G)$, and the edge dimension $edim(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum cardinality among all edge resolving sets of $G$.

For a real-valued function $g$ defined on $V(G)$ and for $U\subseteq V(G)$, let $g(U)=\sum_{s\in U}g(s)$. Then $g:V(G)\rightarrow[0,1]$ is an edge resolving function of $G$ if $g(R\{e_1,e_2\})\ge1$ for any distinct $e_1,e_2\in E(G)$. The fractional edge dimension $edim_f(G)$ of $G$ is $\min\{g(V(G)):g\mbox{ is an edge resolving function of }G\}$. Note that $edim_f(G)$ reduces to $edim(G)$ if the codomain of edge resolving functions is restricted to $\{0,1\}$.

We introduce and study fractional edge dimension and obtain some general results on the edge dimension of graphs. We show that there exist two non-isomorphic graphs on the same vertex set with the same edge metric coordinates. We construct two graphs $G$ and $H$ such that $H \subset G$ and both $edim(H)-edim(G)$ and $edim_f(H)-edim_f(G)$ can be arbitrarily large. We show that a graph $G$ with $edim(G)=2$ cannot have $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ as a subgraph, and we construct a non-planar graph $H$ satisfying $edim(H)=2$. It is easy to see that, for any connected graph $G$ of order $n\ge3$, $1\le edim_f(G) \le \frac{n}{2}$; we characterize graphs $G$ satisfying $edim_f(G)=1$ and examine some graph classes satisfying $edim_f(G)=\frac{n}{2}$. We also determine the fractional edge dimension for some classes of graphs.","(617, 17)","Graph theory is a fundamental field of mathematics that deals with the study of mathematical structures called graphs. Of particular interest are the concepts of edge dimension and fractional edge dimension, which are important parameters for many applications in computer science, communication networks and social networks. In this paper, we investigate these two parameters by providing new theoretical results, algorithms and applications.

First, we define the edge dimension of a graph as the smallest integer k such that the edges of the graph can be represented as the union of k matchings. This definition leads to several interesting properties, such as the fact that the edge dimension of a bipartite graph is equal to its maximum degree. We also study the complexity of computing the edge dimension of a graph, and propose a dynamic programming algorithm that solves this problem in polynomial time.

Second, we introduce the concept of fractional edge dimension, which is a real-valued parameter that measures the extent to which the edges of a graph can be covered by matchings of fractional size. We prove that the fractional edge dimension of a graph is always less than or equal to its edge dimension, and show that there exist graphs whose fractional edge dimension is strictly smaller than their edge dimension.

Finally, we present several applications of edge dimension and fractional edge dimension in various contexts. For example, we show how edge dimension can be used to study the complexity of network routing problems in communication networks, and how fractional edge dimension can be used to model the spread of diseases in social networks.

In this paper, we investigate the edge dimension of various classes of graphs, including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, cycles, and trees.

This paper is a continuation of our previous work [21], where we have established that, ","This paper is a continuation of our previous work [21], where we have established that, for the second-order degenerate hyperbolic equation (\p_t^2-t^m\Delta_x)u=f(t,x,u), locally bounded, piecewise smooth solutions u(t,x) exist when the initial data (u,\p_t u)(0,x) belongs to suitable conormal classes. In the present paper, we will study low regularity solutions of higher-order degenerate hyperbolic equations in the category of discontinuous and even unbounded functions. More specifically, we are concerned with the local existence and singularity structure of low regularity solutions of the higher-order degenerate hyperbolic equations \p_t(\p_t^2-t^m\Delta_x)u=f(t,x,u) and (\p_t^2-t^{m_1}\Delta_x)(\p_t^2-t^{m_2}\Delta_x)v=f(t,x,v) in \R_+\times\R^n with discontinuous initial data \p_t^iu(0,x)=\phi_i(x) (0\le i\le 2) and \p_t^jv(0,x)=\psi_j(x) (0\le j\le 3), respectively; here m, m_1, m_2\in\N, m_1\neq m_2, x\in\R^n, n\ge 2, and f is C^\infty smooth in its arguments. When the \phi_i and \psi_j are piecewise smooth with respect to the hyperplane \{x_1=0\} at t=0, we show that local solutions u(t,x), v(t,x)\in L^{\infty}((0,T)\times\R^n) exist which are C^\infty away from \G_0\cup \G_m^\pm and \G_{m_1}^\pm\cup\G_{m_2}^\pm in [0,T]\times\R^n, respectively; here \G_0=\{(t,x): t\ge 0, x_1=0\} and the \Gamma_k^\pm = \{(t,x): t\ge 0, x_1=\pm \f{2t^{(k+2)/2}}{k+2}\} are two characteristic surfaces forming a cusp.

When the \phi_i and \psi_j belong to C_0^\infty(\R^n\setminus\{0\}) and are homogeneous of degree zero close to x=0, then there exist local solutions u(t,x), v(t,x)\in L_{loc}^\infty((0,T]\times\R^n) which are C^\infty away from \G_m\cup l_0 and \G_{m_1}\cup\G_{m_2} in [0,T]\times\R^n, respectively; here \Gamma_k=\{(t,x): t\ge 0, |x|^2=\f{4t^{k+2}}{(k+2)^2}\} (k=m, m_1, m_2) is a cuspidal conic surface and l_0=\{(t,x): t\ge 0, |x|=0\} is a ray.","(490, 5)","This research paper investigates the existence and singular structure of low regularity solutions of higher-order degenerate hyperbolic equations. Degenerate hyperbolic equations arise naturally in various fields such as fluid mechanics, physics, and geometry. The behavior of solutions near singularities has been of great interest in mathematics and is crucial for understanding the dynamics and regularity of solutions to these equations. 

We introduce a new methodology for studying the behavior of solutions to higher-order degenerate hyperbolic equations. Our approach relies on understanding the geometric structure and regularity properties of the characteristic variety associated with these equations. We provide a detailed analysis of this characteristic variety and show that it plays a key role in determining the existence and nature of singularities.

Our results demonstrate that the singular structure of solutions to higher-order degenerate hyperbolic equations is more complex than previously thought. We identify a range of singularities that may occur, including removable and non-removable singularities, jump discontinuities, and wave front tracking. By providing a thorough analysis of the geometric properties of the characteristic variety, we are able to characterize the type and location of singularities that can arise in solutions of these equations.

We also consider the regularity properties of solutions and establish the sharpness of some known results regarding the regularity of solutions to degenerate hyperbolic equations. Our findings reveal that solutions to these equations may have lower regularity than previously believed. Specifically, we compute explicit examples of solutions that belong to Sobolev spaces of negative order.

Specifically, we consider the case where the initial data belongs to the Sobolev space $H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ with $s < \frac{n}{2}$.

Our investigation is motivated by the fact that, in many physical applications, the initial data may not have sufficient regularity to guarantee the existence of smooth solutions. For instance, in the context of fluid dynamics, the initial velocity field may be highly irregular due to the presence of shocks or vortices. In such cases, it is essential to understand the behavior of solutions with low regularity initial data, as they may exhibit singularities that are not present in the smooth case.

To tackle this problem, we employ a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. On the analytical side, we use the method of energy estimates to derive a priori bounds on the solution in terms of the initial data. This allows us to show that the solution remains bounded in certain Sobolev norms, even when the initial data has low regularity. On the numerical side, we use a high-order finite difference scheme to approximate the solution and study its behavior numerically.

ASXDF1100.053.1 is an unlensed optically dark millimetre-bright SMG with $K_{\rm AB}>25.7$ ($2\sigma$), which was expected to lie at $z=$5-7 based on its radio-submm photo-$z$. Our data detected line emission due to $^{12}$CO($J=$5-4) and ($J=$6-5), providing a $z_{\rm CO}= 5.2383\pm0.0005$.

Energy-coupled SED modelling indicates properties of $L_{\rm IR}=8.3^{+1.5}_{-1.4}\times10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$, SFR $=630^{+260}_{-380}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, $M_{\rm dust}=4.4^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$, $M_{\rm stellar}=3.5^{+3.6}_{-1.4}\times10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, and $T_{\rm dust}=37.4^{+2.3}_{-1.8}$ K. The CO luminosity allows us to estimate a gas mass $M_{\rm gas}=3.1\pm0.3\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, suggesting a gas-to-dust mass ratio of around 70, fairly typical for $z\sim2$ SMGs.

ASXDF1100.053.1 has $R_{\rm e, mm}=1.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ kpc, so its surface $L_{\rm IR}$ density $\Sigma_{\rm IR}$ is $1.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}\times10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-2}$. These properties indicate that ASXDF1100.053.1 is a massive dusty star-forming (SF) galaxy with an unusually compact starburst. It lies close to the SF main sequence at $z\sim5$, with low $M_{\rm gas}$/$M_{\rm stellar}=0.09$, SFR/SFR$_{\rm MS} (R_{\rm SB})=0.6$, and a gas-depletion time $\tau_{\rm dep}$ of $\approx 50$ Myr, modulo assumptions about the stellar initial mass function in such objects. ASXDF1100.053.1 has extreme values of $M_{\rm gas}/M_{\rm stellar}$, $R_{\rm SB}$, and $\tau_{\rm dep}$ compared to SMGs at $z\sim$2-4, and those of ASXDF1100.053.1 are the smallest among SMGs at $z>5$. ASXDF1100.053.1 is likely a late-stage dusty starburst prior to passivisation. The number of $z=$5.1-5.3 unlensed SMGs now suggests a number density $dN/dz=30.4\pm19.0$ deg$^{-2}$, barely consistent with the latest cosmological simulations.","(544, 10)","We present the discovery of an optically dark submillimetre galaxy (SMG) at a redshift $z=5.24$ in the NOEMA Large Programme entitled Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA-NEMA). The galaxy was originally detected in the AzTEC survey with the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE). The AzTEC survey is one of the deepest and most extensive extragalactic (sub-)millimetre surveys ever carried out. The volume density of optically faint or dark submillimetre galaxies is a key observational constraint on the total rate of star formation in the early Universe, and a key piece of information to test current galaxy formation models.

Using the high-sensitivity and high-angular resolution of NOEMA, we were able to accurately determine the redshift of the SMG through CO line observations. The CO line is a powerful tracer of molecular gas, which in turn is the fuel for star formation in galaxies. We estimated the total molecular gas mass of the SMG, and found that it is similar to that of other dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshift. The star-formation rate inferred from the molecular gas and dust emissions is at a level of several hundred solar masses per year, which is amongst the highest for any galaxy known at this redshift. This indicates that the SMG is currently undergoing a late-stage starburst phase, fueled by a massive, gas-rich merger. 

Despite the clear evidence of vigorous star formation, the galaxy is not detected in deep optical images from the Subaru and HST telescopes. This implies that the galaxy is very dusty, with the dust obscuring the ultraviolet and visible light emitted by stars that are being formed. Our finding highlights the importance of submillimeter continuum and redshift measurements for understanding the properties and evolution of dusty, high-redshift galaxies. 

The NOEMA observations also allowed us to constrain the size of the molecular gas reservoir in the SMG. We found that the gas distribution is significantly more compact than the dust continuum emission, indicating that the dusty star-forming region forms a relatively small fraction of the total gas reservoir in the galaxy. Based on this result, we speculate that the galaxy may undergo a rapid quenching of its star formation activity, fueled by the exhaustion of its gas supply. Our finding suggests that compact, optically dark submillimetre galaxies at high redshift offer an important window into the late-stage processes of massive-galaxy formation.","(430, 16)","We have obtained 1 and 3 mm spectral scans of ASXDF1100.053.1 using NOEMA. ASXDF1100.053.1 is 1 of the brightest submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) detected by the AzTEC survey on the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Our NOEMA observations confirm the detection of CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission lines, which are indicative of a massive star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 5.24. This galaxy is optically dark, meaning that it is not detected in deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. The lack of optical detection suggests that the galaxy has undergone significant dust obscuration, likely due to the presence of a large amount of gas and dust in the interstellar medium.

Our NOEMA observations reveal a complex velocity structure in the CO emission lines, indicating the presence of multiple velocity components within the galaxy. We interpret this as evidence of a late-stage starburst, where the galaxy has undergone a period of intense star formation before being quenched. This is supported by the detection of a strong [CII] emission line, which is often used as a tracer of star formation activity. The [CII] line is observed to be blueshifted with respect to the CO lines, suggesting that the starburst is occurring in a region of the galaxy that is moving away from us.

We estimate the star formation rate (SFR) of the galaxy to be approximately 1000 solar masses per year, based on the luminosity of the CO and [CII] lines. This is one of the highest SFRs observed in a galaxy at such a high redshift. We also estimate the molecular gas mass to be approximately 10^11 solar masses, based on the CO luminosity. This is a significant amount of gas, and suggests that the galaxy may be in the process of forming a large number of stars before being quenched.

Our results have implications for our understanding of galaxy evolution at high redshifts. The detection of an optically-dark galaxy with such a high SFR suggests that these galaxies may be more common than previously thought. This has significant implications for models of galaxy evolution, which often rely on the assumption that galaxies are optically bright. Our results also suggest that the quenching of star formation in galaxies may be a more complex process than previously thought, involving multiple stages of star formation and gas consumption.

Single electron sources enable electron quantum optics experiments where single electrons emitted in a ballistic ","Single electron sources enable electron quantum optics experiments where single electrons emitted in a ballistic electronic interferometer plays the role of a single photons emitted in an optical medium in Quantum Optics. A qualitative step has been made with the recent generation of single charge levitons obtained by applying Lorentzian voltage pulse on the contact of the quantum conductor. Simple to realize and operate, the source emits electrons in the form of striking minimal excitation states called levitons. We review the striking properties of levitons and their possible applications in quantum physics to electron interferometry and entanglement.

Copyright line will be provided by the publisher 1 Single electron sources In this introduction, we will distinguish single charge sources from coherent single electrons sources. The former have been developed for quantum metrology where the goal is to transfer an integer charge at high frequency f through a conductor with good accuracy to realize a quantized current source whose current I = ef shows metrological accuracy. The latter, the coherent single electrons source, aims at emitting (injecting) a single electron whose wave-function is well defined and controlled to realize further single electron coherent manipulation via quantum gates. The gates are provided by electronic beam-splitters made with Quantum Point Contacts or provided by electronic Mach-Zehnder and Fabry-Prot interferometers. Here it is important that the injected single electron is the only excitation created in the conductor. The frequency f of injection is not chosen to have a large current, as current accuracy is not the goal, but only to get sufficient statistics on the electron transfer events to extract physical information. 1.1 single charge sources for current standards The first manipulation of single charges trace back to the early 90's where physicists took advantage of charge quan-tization of a submicronic metallic island nearly isolated from leads by tunnel barriers.

We investigate the generation, manipulation, and detection of levitons in different types of devices, including quantum point contacts, quantum dots, and edge channels. Quantitative understanding of the dynamics of levitons is crucial for their application in quantum information processing, and we demonstrate methods to reliably generate levitons with high fidelity and distinguish them from other electronic excitations in the system.

Furthermore, we explore how levitons can be used to probe fundamental physics of one-dimensional quantum systems, such as the emergence of Luttinger liquid behavior, and novel effects at the single-electron level. By demonstrating the feasibility of these experiments, we hope to inspire researchers to explore new avenues in the field of electron quantum optics using levitons.

We also investigate the potential applications of levitons in technological devices, such as quantum metrology, sensing, and information processing. In particular, we propose a scheme for implementing a leviton-based electron interferometer that can be used as a phase-sensitive detector with high sensitivity and minimal perturbation to the system. The proposed interferometer has the potential to revolutionize the field of electron interferometry and expand the range of applications to measure electronic properties beyond the traditional DC transport measurements.

In the first of the series, we studied the phenomena of persistence, and the asymptotic spreading for solutions. In the second of the series, we investigate the existence, uniqueness and stability of strictly positive entire solutions.

In the current part of the series, we discuss the existence of transition front solutions of (0.1) connecting $(0,0)$ and $(u^*(t),v^*(t))$ in the case of space homogeneous logistic source. We show that for every $\chi>0$ with $\chi\mu\big(1+\frac{\sup_{t\in R}a(t)}{\inf_{t\in R}a(t)}\big)<\inf_{t\in R}b(t)$, there is a positive constant $c^{*}_{\chi}$ such that for every $\underline{c}>c^{*}_{\chi}$ and every unit vector $\xi$, (0.1) has a transition front solution of the form $(u(x,t),v(x,t))=(U(x\cdot\xi-C(t),t),V(x\cdot\xi-C(t),t))$ satisfying that $C'(t)=\frac{a(t)+\kappa^2}{\kappa}$ for some number $\kappa>0$, $\liminf_{t-s\to\infty}\frac{C(t)-C(s)}{t-s}=\underline{c}$, and$$\lim_{x\to-\infty}\sup_{t\in R}|U(x,t)-u^*(t)|=0 \quad \text{and}\quad \lim_{x\to\infty}\sup_{t\in R}|\frac{U(x,t)}{e^{-\kappa x}}-1|=0.$$Furthermore, we prove that there is no transition front solution $(u(x,t),v(x,t))=(U(x\cdot\xi-C(t),t),V(x\cdot\xi-C(t),t))$ of (0.1) connecting $(0,0)$ and $(u^*(t),v^*(t))$ with least mean speed less than $2\sqrt{\underline{a}}$, where $\underline{a}=\liminf_{t-s\to\infty}\frac{1}{t-s}\int_{s}^{t}a(\tau)d\tau$.","(599, 5)","In this paper, we investigate a parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis model with space-time dependent logistic sources defined on $\mathbb{R}^N$, focusing on the emergence and propagation of transition fronts.

Context: Quantifying the gas content inside the dust gaps of transition disks is important to ","Context: Quantifying the gas content inside the dust gaps of transition disks is important to establish their origin. Aims: We seek to constrain the surface density of warm gas in the disk of HD 139614, a Herbig Ae star with a transition disk exhibiting a dust gap from 2.3 to 6 AU. Methods: We have obtained ESO/VLT CRIRES high-resolution spectra of CO ro-vibrational emission.

We derived constraints on the disk's structure by modeling the line-profiles, the spectroastrometric signal, and the rotational diagrams using flat Keplerian disk models. Results: We detected v=1-0 12CO, 2-1 12CO, 1-0 13CO, 1-0 C18O, and 1-0 C17O ro-vibrational lines. 12CO v=1-0 lines have an average width of 14 km/s, Tgas of 450 K and an emitting region from 1 to 15 AU. 13CO and C18O lines are on average 70 and 100 K colder, 1 and 4 km/s narrower, and are dominated by emission at R>6 AU. The 12CO v=1-0 line-profile indicates that if there is a gap in the gas it must be narrower than 2 AU. We find that a drop in the gas surface density (delta_gas) at R<5-6 AU is required to simultaneously reproduce the line-profiles and rotational diagrams of the three CO isotopologs.

Delta_gas can range from 10^-2 to 10^-4 depending on the gas-to-dust ratio of the outer disk. We find that at 1<R<6 AU the gas surface density profile is flat or increases with radius. We derive a gas column density at 1<R<6 AU of NH=3x10^19 - 10^21 cm^-2. We find a 5sigma upper limit on NCO at R<1 AU of 5x10^15 cm^-2 (NH<5x10^19 cm^-2). Conclusions: The dust gap in the disk of HD 139614 has gas. The gas surface density in the disk at R<6 AU is significantly lower than the surface density expected from HD 139614's accretion rate assuming a viscous alpha-disk model. The gas density drop, the non-negative density gradient of the gas inside 6 AU, and the absence of a wide (>2 AU) gas gap suggest the presence of an embedded <2 MJ planet at around 4 AU.","(402, 16)","In this paper, we investigate a potential gas density drop in the inner 6 AU of the transition disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 139614. This star is known to host a protoplanetary disk with a depleted inner cavity, suggestive of planet formation. We analyze new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of HD 139614 at a resolution of 0.035 arcseconds, which allowed us to resolve the possibility of a gas density gap. Our analysis confirms that there is, in fact, a sharp depletion in gas density within the disk, with a depth of approximately 50% at 3 AU. 

The most plausible explanation for this gas density gap is the presence of a giant planet inside the disk, which has cleared out the gas in its immediate vicinity. Such a planet would be located within the disk's inner cavity, in line with the predictions of current planet formation theories. We estimate the planet's mass to be in the range of 2 to 7 Jupiter masses, based on the observed gap width and depth. This is consistent with the minimum mass required for a planet to carve a significant gap in a protoplanetary disk. 

Our observations of HD 139614 provide further evidence for ongoing planet formation in the disk. The presence of a giant planet inside the disk's cavity has important implications for planet formation models. It suggests that the gas giants may be forming relatively quickly, within a few million years, and that they may play an important role in shaping the overall structure of the disk. More high-resolution observations of HD 139614 and other similar systems are required to confirm our findings and to better understand the processes involved in planet formation. 

Overall, our study of the disk around HD 139614 provides important insights into the early stages of planet formation and supports the current models of giant planet formation. It also highlights the potential of high-resolution observations with ALMA to uncover new details about circumstellar disks and their role in planet formation.","(367, 14)","Context: Quantifying the gas content inside the dust gaps of transition disks is important to  understand the formation and evolution of planets within these systems. The Herbig Ae star, HD 139614, hosts a well-studied transition disk with a prominent dust gap at 6 AU. Recent studies suggest the presence of a giant planet embedded within this disk.

Research Question: What is the gas density distribution within the first 6 AU of HD 139614's transition disk, and how does it relate to the proposed giant planet?

Methodology: We employed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the 1.3 mm continuum and CO J=2-1 line emission towards HD 139614. The data were reduced using the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package, and the resulting images were analyzed to determine the gas density distribution.

Findings: Our ALMA observations reveal a significant drop in gas density within the first 5 AU of the disk, coinciding with the location of the dust gap. The gas density decreases by a factor of 2.5 compared to the outer regions of the disk. Furthermore, we detect a subtle asymmetry in the gas distribution, suggesting the presence of a massive object perturbing the disk.

Discussion: The observed gas density drop is consistent with the predictions of hydrodynamic simulations, which suggest that a giant planet can carve out a gap in the disk by accreting material and creating a pressure gradient. The detected asymmetry supports the idea that the giant planet is embedded within the disk, with its gravitational influence affecting the surrounding gas.

Implications: Our findings provide further evidence for the existence of a giant planet within the HD 139614 transition disk.

We discuss the results of a campaign to monitor spectral variations in the low-luminosity Seyfert~1 ","We discuss the results of a campaign to monitor spectral variations in the low-luminosity Seyfert~1 galaxy NGC~4593, at X-rays, ultraviolet, optical and near IR frequencies. The observations and data analysis have been described in a companion paper (Santos-Lle\'o et al. 1994; Paper~1). The active nucleus in this galaxy is strongly and rapidly variable in all wavebands, implying that the continuum source is unusually compact. Its energy distribution from 1.2~$\mu$m to 1200~\AA\/ obeys a power-law whose index is significantly steeper than is usual in Seyfert's or QSO's; the ``big bump'' is either absent or shifted to wavelengths shorter than 1200~\AA\/. The variations of the soft-X~ray {\em excess\/} do not correlate with those of the UV or hard X-ray continuum. The far UV and optical fluxes are well correlated, while the correlation between the hard X-rays and 1447 \AA\ continuum is only marginally significant. Moreover, the optical flux cannot lag behind the UV by more than 6 days. These results cannot be accommodated in the framework of the standard geometrically thin accretion disk model. Rather, they suggest that the bulk of the UV and optical flux originates from thermal reprocessing of X-rays irradiating the disk. The soft X-ray excess is probably the only spectral component which originates from viscous dissipation inside the disk and the near infrared is probably emitted by hot dust heated by the UV radiation. Such a model is consistent with NGC~4593 having a relatively small black-hole mass of the order of $2\times10^{6}{\rm M_{\odot}}$ as inferred from the line variability study. The high ionization/excitation emission lines are very broad and strongly variable and their variations correlate with those of the continuum. The low excitation lines are significantly narrower and remain constant within the accuracy of our measurements. These results suggest a stratified BLR, where the degree of ionization and the velocity dispersion of the gas increase toward small radii. The \lya\ line responds to the variations of the continuum with a delay $\leq 4$ days. To a first order approximation, the BLR in NGC~4593 is well modelled with two different zones at distances of $\sim$~15 and 3 lt-ds from the ionizing source respectively.","(414, 17)","The Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593 has been observed through multi-frequency monitoring in order to investigate the properties of its compact nucleus. This study is a follow-up to a previous one in which a relation between flux variability and spectral index was detected in the radio bands. In this paper, we present our observations obtained between 2014 and 2015, using the radio telescopes located in Australia, India, and Korea. We also made dedicated observations in the optical/UV and X-ray domains. We analyzed the variability of the source and found a general anticorrelation between the X-ray and radio bands, which supports the idea of a common origin for the emission in these two regimes. We also found evidence of a significant delay between the variations in the optical/UV and X-ray fluxes, which implies that the fluctuations in these two bands may originate from different regions. Our data allowed us to produce the multi-frequency spectral energy distribution of NGC 4593, which is consistent with a compact, non-thermal, and variable nucleus. By modeling the spectral energy distribution, we estimated the physical parameters of the emitting region, such as its size, magnetic field, and electron density. Our results suggest a relatively small size for the nucleus of NGC 4593, which is consistent with previous studies based on reverberation mapping. However, this is not in agreement with some recent investigations that proposed a larger size for the nucleus, based on modeling of the observed spectra. Our findings highlight the importance of multi-frequency and -wavelength monitoring of Seyfert galaxies in order to better understand the nature of their nuclei and the mechanisms responsible for the observed emission.","(298, 11)","We discuss the results of a campaign to monitor spectral variations in the low-luminosity Seyfert~1  galaxy NGC~4593 over a period of several months using a combination of optical and near-infrared spectroscopy.

Our observations revealed significant variability in the continuum emission of NGC~4593 on timescales of days to weeks, with amplitudes of up to 20\% in the optical and 15\% in the near-infrared. These variations were accompanied by changes in the emission-line fluxes, particularly in the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, which showed increases of up to 30\% and 25\%, respectively. We also detected a correlation between the continuum and emission-line variations, suggesting that the latter are driven by changes in the accretion rate onto the SMBH.

To model the observed variability, we employed a combination of relativistic accretion disk and corona models, which provided a good fit to the data.

Context: Tables are ubiquitous formats for data. Therefore, techniques for writing correct programs over tables, ","Context: Tables are ubiquitous formats for data. Therefore, techniques for writing correct programs over tables, and debugging incorrect ones, are vital.

Our specific focus in this paper is on rich types that articulate the properties of tabular operations. We wish to study both their expressive power and _diagnostic quality_.

Inquiry: There is no ""standard library"" of table operations. As a result, every paper (and project) is free to use its own (sub)set of operations. This makes artifacts very difficult to compare, and it can be hard to tell whether omitted operations were left out by oversight or because they cannot actually be expressed. Furthermore, virtually no papers discuss the quality of type error feedback.

Approach: We combed through several existing languages and libraries to create a ""standard library"" of table operations. Each entry is accompanied by a detailed specification of its ""type,"" expressed independent of (and hence not constrained by) any type language. We also studied and categorized a corpus of (student) program edits that resulted in table-related errors. We used this to generate a suite of erroneous programs. Finally, we adapted the concept of a datasheet to facilitate comparisons of different implementations.

Knowledge: Our benchmark creates a common ground to frame work in this area.

Language designers who claim to support typed programming over tables have a clear suite against which to demonstrate their system's expressive power. Our family of errors also gives them a chance to demonstrate the quality of feedback. Researchers who improve one aspect -- especially error reporting -- without changing the other can demonstrate their improvement, as can those who engage in trade-offs between the two. The net result should be much better science in both expressiveness and diagnostics. We also introduce a datasheet format for presenting this knowledge in a methodical way.

Grounding: We have generated our benchmark from real languages, libraries, and programs, as well as personal experience conducting and teaching data science. We have drawn on experience in engineering and, more recently, in data science to generate the datasheet.

Importance: Claims about type support for tabular programming are hard to evaluate. However, tabular programming is ubiquitous, and the expressive power of type systems keeps growing. Our benchmark and datasheet can help lead to more orderly science. It also benefits programmers trying to choose a language.","(447, 25)","Tables are commonly used to represent structured data in a wide range of computer applications. However, verifying the type correctness of tables at compile-time remains a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of tables and the lack of a suitable type system. In this paper, we propose a language design benchmark for type systems that support table typing.

We start by formalizing the notion of table typing and its relevant type rules. We then present several examples that illustrate the use of tables and their corresponding types in different scenarios, such as database applications and spreadsheet programs. We also discuss the limitations of existing type systems in handling table typing and the challenges of designing a type system that can handle this feature effectively.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed benchmark, we compare the performance of different language implementations using the proposed type system. We evaluate the implementations based on their ability to handle complex table structures, their performance in type checking and inference, and their support for modular programming. Our experiments show that some of the current state-of-the-art type systems can handle table typing effectively, while others may require additional extensions to support this feature.

In addition, we present a case study of a real-world application that uses tables and demonstrate how our proposed type system can improve the reliability and maintainability of the application.

There are two major routes to address the ubiquitous family of inverse problems appearing in ","There are two major routes to address the ubiquitous family of inverse problems appearing in signal and image processing, such as denoising or deblurring. A first route relies on Bayesian modeling, where prior probabilities are used to embody models of both the distribution of the unknown variables and their statistical dependence with the observed data. The estimation process typically relies on the minimization of an expected loss (e.g. minimum mean squared error, or MMSE). The second route has received much attention in the context of sparse regularization and compressive sensing: it consists in designing (often convex) optimization problems involving the sum of a data fidelity term and a penalty term promoting certain types of unknowns (e.g., sparsity, promoted through an 1 norm). Well known relations between these two approaches have lead to some widely spread misconceptions. In particular, while the so-called Maximum A Posterori (MAP) estimate with a Gaussian noise model does lead to an optimization problem with a quadratic data-fidelity term, we disprove through explicit examples the common belief that the converse would be true. It has already been shown [7, 9] that for denoising in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, for any prior probability on the unknowns, MMSE estimation can be expressed as a penalized least squares problem, with the apparent characteristics of a MAP estimation problem with Gaussian noise and a (generally) different prior on the unknowns. In other words, the variational approach is rich enough to build all possible MMSE estimators associated to additive Gaussian noise via a well chosen penalty. We generalize these results beyond Gaussian denoising and characterize noise models for which the same phenomenon occurs. In particular, we prove that with (a variant of) Poisson noise and any prior probability on the unknowns, MMSE estimation can again be expressed as the solution of a penalized least squares optimization problem. For additive scalar denois-ing the phenomenon holds if and only if the noise distribution is log-concave. In particular, Laplacian denoising can (perhaps surprisingly) be expressed as the solution of a penalized least squares problem. In the multivariate case, the same phenomenon occurs when the noise model belongs to a particular subset of the exponential family. For multivariate additive denoising, the phenomenon holds if and only if the noise is white and Gaussian.","(428, 15)","Bayesian estimation is a powerful technique for estimating the parameters of statistical models. It has proven to be particularly useful in settings where the amount of available data is limited or where there are strong prior beliefs about the unknown parameters. In this paper, we explore the relationship between Bayesian estimation and proximity operators.

Proximity operators are a type of nonlinear operator that can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems. These operators have been shown to be closely related to Bayesian estimation, particularly in the context of regularization. In fact, one can view many popular regularization techniques as using proximity operators to enforce constraints on the estimated parameters. 

In this paper, we highlight the connections between Bayesian estimation and proximity operators by examining several specific examples. We show that Bayesian estimation can be viewed as a type of proximal mapping, where the prior distribution is used as a regularizer. This approach allows us to impose structure on the estimated parameters in a way that is consistent with our prior beliefs.

We also investigate the role of proximity operators in the context of empirical Bayes methods. Empirical Bayes is a technique for estimating hyperparameters in hierarchical models, where parameters are estimated in a Bayesian framework. We show that proximity operators can be used to derive closed-form expressions for the hyperparameters in many cases, which can be more efficient than traditional methods such as maximum likelihood estimation.

Finally, we examine the use of proximity operators in nonparametric Bayesian models. Nonparametric models are useful in situations where the underlying distribution is unknown or where the data has a complex structure. We show that proximity operators can be used to develop efficient algorithms for inference in these models, allowing us to make accurate predictions and make informed decisions.

Overall, our analysis highlights the use of proximity operators in Bayesian estimation and illustrates their usefulness in a variety of settings. We believe that our results will be of interest to researchers in statistics, machine learning, and related fields who are interested in developing efficient and accurate inference methods.","(375, 17)","There are two major routes to address the ubiquitous family of inverse problems appearing in  signal processing, machine learning, and statistics: Bayesian estimation and non-Bayesian proximal methods.

We address the following general question: given a graph class C on which we can ","We address the following general question: given a graph class C on which we can solve Maximum Matching in (quasi) linear time, does the same hold true for the class of graphs that can be modularly decomposed into C ? A major difficulty in this task is that the Maximum Matching problem is not preserved by quotient, thereby making difficult to exploit the structural properties of the quotient subgraphs of the modular decomposition. So far, we are only aware of a recent framework in [Coudert et al., SODA'18] that only applies when the quotient subgraphs have bounded order and/or under additional assumptions on the nontriv-ial modules in the graph. As a first attempt toward improving this framework we study the combined effect of modular decomposition with a pruning process over the quotient subgraphs. More precisely, we remove sequentially from all such subgraphs their so-called one-vertex extensions (i.e., pendant, anti-pendant, twin, universal and isolated vertices). Doing so, we obtain a ""pruned modular decomposition"", that can be computed in O(m log n)-time. Our main result is that if all the pruned quotient subgraphs have bounded order then a maximum matching can be computed in linear time. This result is mostly based on two pruning rules on pendant and anti-pendant modules -- that are adjacent, respectively, to one or all but one other modules in the graph.

Furthermore, these two latter rules are surprisingly intricate and we consider them as our main technical contribution in the paper. We stress that the class of graphs that can be totally decomposed by the pruned modular decomposition contains all the distance-hereditary graphs, and so, it is larger than cographs. In particular, as a byproduct of our approach we also obtain the first known linear-time algorithms for Maximum Matching on distance-hereditary graphs and graphs with modular-treewidth at most one. Finally, we can use an extended version of our framework in order to compute a maximum matching, in linear-time, for all graph classes that can be modularly decomposed into cycles. Our work is the first to explain why the existence of some nice ordering over the modules of a graph, instead of just over its vertices, can help to speed up the computation of maximum matchings on some graph classes.","(419, 13)","In the field of graph theory, maximum matching algorithms are widely used to solve problems involving finding the largest possible matching between vertices in a graph. However, for certain types of graphs, such as planar and outerplanar graphs, the existing maximum matching algorithms may not be efficient enough. In this paper, we propose the use of a pruned modular decomposition technique to improve the efficiency of maximum matching algorithms on these graph classes.

A modular decomposition is a method of breaking down a graph into smaller pieces called modules. These modules are then used to identify certain characteristics of the graph, such as its connectedness or its tree-like structure. Pruning refers to the removal of unnecessary modules from this decomposition to improve the efficiency of subsequent algorithms.

Our proposed pruned modular decomposition algorithm has been shown to improve the performance of maximum matching algorithms on planar and outerplanar graphs. We tested our algorithm on a variety of graphs, comparing its performance to that of existing maximum matching algorithms. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of speed and the ability to handle particularly large graphs.

Moreover, we observed that our approach can be extended to graphs with larger tree-width, where the modular decomposition technique can still be used to identify tree-like structures in the graph, and the pruning of unnecessary modules leads to improved efficiency.

In conclusion, our proposed pruned modular decomposition technique can be used to improve the efficiency of maximum matching algorithms on planar and outerplanar graphs, and has potential to extend to a wider range of graphs with larger tree-width. Our results provide a significant step towards efficient graph theoretic algorithms on a wider range of graph classes.","(311, 12)","We address the following general question: given a graph class C on which we can 2-approximate the Maximum Matching (MM) problem in polynomial time, can we improve the running time of the 2-approximation algorithm by using a pruned version of the Modular Decomposition (MD) of the input graph? In other words, we investigate whether the MD can be used as a pre-processing step to reduce the size of the input graph before applying a known 2-approximating algorithm for the MM problem.

To answer this question, we start by recalling the definition of the MD of a graph. The MD is a partition of the vertices of a graph into modules, where a module is a subset of vertices such that any two vertices in the same module are connected by a path that does not contain any vertex outside the module. We also recall the definition of a pruned MD, which is obtained by removing some of the modules from the original MD while preserving the property that any two vertices connected by a path in the original graph are still connected in the pruned graph.

Our main contribution is to show that the pruned MD can be used to reduce the number of vertices in the input graph, which in turn allows us to speed up the running time of existing 2-approximative algorithms for the MM problem. To achieve this, we develop a new algorithm that takes as input a graph G and a pruned MD of G, and outputs a maximum matching of G. The algorithm works by first computing a maximum matching of each module in the pruned MD, and then combining these matchings to obtain a maximum matching of the entire graph.

Analysis of new precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from the Lick Automated Planet Finder (APF) ","Analysis of new precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from the Lick Automated Planet Finder (APF) and Keck HIRES have yielded the discovery of three new exoplanet candidates orbiting two nearby K dwarfs not previously reported to have companions (HD 190007 & HD 216520). We also report new velocities from both the APF and the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) for the previously reported planet host stars GJ 686 and HD 180617 and update the corresponding exoplanet orbital models. Of the newly discovered planets, HD 190007 b has a period of 11.72 days, an RV semi-amplitude of K = 5.64$\pm$0.55 m s$^{-1}$, a minimum mass of 16.46$\pm$1.66 $\rm M_{\oplus}$, and orbits the slightly metal-rich, active K4 dwarf star HD 190007 (d = 12.7 pc).

Both of these planets orbit the slightly metal-poor, inactive K0 dwarf star HD 216520 (d = 19.6 pc). We find that our updated best fit models for HD 180617 b and GJ 686 b are in good agreement with the previously published results. For HD 180617 b we obtain an orbital period of 105.91 days, an RV semi-amplitude of K = 2.696$\pm$0.22 m s$^{-1}$, and a minimum mass of 2.214$\pm$1.05 $\rm M_{\oplus}$.

Using an injection-recovery exercise, we find that HD 190007 b and HD 216520 b are unlikely to have additional planets with masses and orbital periods within a factor of two, in marked contrast to $\sim$85\% of planets in this mass and period range found with Kepler.","(465, 9)","The Lick Carnegie Exoplanet Survey (LCES) has collected data from a large sample of small planets beyond the solar system. In this paper, we present a collage of these planets and focus on their properties in the super-Earth and sub-Neptune mass regime. Our analysis utilizes radial velocity measurements from the Keck Observatory and the Carnegie Planet Finder Spectrograph, as well as photometric data from the TESS mission. 

We find that the LCES sample contains a diverse population of planets, ranging in mass from roughly 1 to 20 Earth masses and in orbital period from a few days to a few months. Many of these planets are found in multi-planet systems, and their masses and radii suggest a wide range of compositions, likely including water and hydrogen-rich atmospheres.

Our analysis also reveals some interesting correlations between planet mass and other properties. For example, we find that the distribution of planet masses in the LCES sample peaks around 4-5 Earth masses, which may indicate a transition in planet formation processes in this mass range. Additionally, we find a correlation between planet mass and the occurrence of atmospheric evaporation, which may play a role in dictating the overall population of small exoplanets.

The purpose of this paper is to point the effectiveness of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition, i.e. ","The purpose of this paper is to point the effectiveness of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition, i.e. the decomposition of a square matrix $U$ with coefficients in a field $k$ containing the eigenvalues of $U$ as a sum $U=D+N,$ where $D$ is a diagonalizable matrix and $N$ a nilpotent matrix which commutes with $D.$ The most general version of this decomposition shows that every separable element $u$ of a $k$-algebra $A$ can be written in a unique way as a sum $u=d+n,$ where $d \in A$ is absolutely semi-simple and where $n\in A$ is nilpotent and commutes with $d.$ In fact an algorithm, due to C. Chevalley, allows to compute this decomposition: this algorithm is an adaptation to this context of the Newton method, which gives here the exact value of the absolutely semi-simple part $d$ of $u$ after a finite number of iterations. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method by computing the decomposition of a $15 \times 15$ matrix having eigenvalues of multiplicity 3 which are not computable exactly. We also discuss the other classical method, based on the chinese remainder theorem, which gives the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition under the form $u=q(u) +[u-q(u)],$ with $q(u)$ absolutely semi-simple, $u-q(u)$ nilpotent, where $q$ is any solution of a system of congruence equations related to the roots of a polynomial $p\in k[x]$ such that $p(u)=0.$ It is indeed possible to compute $q$ without knowing the roots of $p$ by applying the algorithm discussed above to $\pi(x),$ where $\pi: k[x] \to k[x]/pk[x]$ is the canonical surjection. We obtain this way after 2 iterations the polynomial $q$ of degree 14 associated to the $15\times 15$ matrix mentioned above. We justify by historical considerations the use of the name ""Jordan-Chevalley decomposition"", instead of the name ""Dunford decomposition"" which also appears in the literature, and we discuss multiplicative versions of this decomposition in semi-simple Lie groups. We conclude this paper showing why this decomposition should play a central role in a linear algebra course, even at a rather elementary level. Our arguments are based on a teaching experience of more than 10 years in an engineering school located on the Basque Coast.","(477, 8)","This paper presents an effective decomposition technique for Jordan-Chevalley matrices in linear algebra and discusses its pedagogical implications for teaching this topic. The Jordan-Chevalley decomposition is a crucial tool in the study of linear transformations and matrices and provides a way to split a matrix into two parts: a diagonalizable part and a nilpotent part. While the decomposition is well-known in theory, its effective computation may require sophisticated algorithms due to the non-commuting nature of these two components. 

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to compute the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition in a more efficient manner using a block diagonalization technique combined with matrix exponentials. Our method allows for faster computation times and more intuitive interpretations of the decomposition coefficients. Additionally, we show how this technique can be applied in a variety of teaching contexts to enhance students' understanding of the spectral theory of matrices. 

Moreover, by incorporating the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition into the curriculum, we aim to deepen students' understanding of diagonalizable and nilpotent matrices, and their properties. We provide examples of how this can be done in undergraduate linear algebra courses, as well as discuss the potential benefits of this approach in advanced courses such as algebraic geometry, representation theory, and differential equations.

Seismic waves due to strong earthquakes propagating in surficial soil layers may both reduce soil ","Seismic waves due to strong earthquakes propagating in surficial soil layers may both reduce soil stiffness and increase the energy dissipation into the soil. To investigate seismic wave amplification in such cases, past studies have been devoted to one-directional shear wave propagation in a soil column (1D-propagation) considering one motion component only (1C-polarization). Three independent purely 1C computations may be performed ('1D-1C' approach) and directly superimposed in the case of weak motions (linear behaviour). This research aims at studying local site effects by considering seismic wave propagation in a 1-D soil profile accounting for the influence of the 3-D loading path and non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the soil. In the proposed '1D-3C' approach, the three components (3C-polarization) of the incident wave are simultaneously propagated into a horizontal multilayered soil. A 3-D non-linear constitutive relation for the soil is implemented in the framework of the Finite Element Method in the time domain. The complex rheology of soils is modelled by mean of a multisurface cyclic plasticity model of the Masing-Prandtl-Ishlinskii-Iwan type. The great advantage of this choice is that the only data needed to describe the model is the modulus reduction curve. A parametric study is carried out to characterize the changes in the seismic motion of the surficial layers due to both incident wavefield properties and soil non-linearities. The numerical simulations show a seismic response depending on several parameters such as polarization of seismic waves, material elastic and dynamic properties, as well as on the impedance contrast between layers and frequency content and oscillatory character of the input motion. The 3-D loading path due to the 3C-polarization leads to multi-axial stress interaction that reduces soil strength and increases non-linear effects. The non-linear behaviour of the soil may have beneficial or detrimental effects on the seismic response at the free surface, depending on the energy dissipation rate. Free surface time histories, stress-strain hysteresis loops and in-depth profiles of octahedral stress and strain are estimated for each soil column.

The combination of three separate 1D-1C non-linear analyses is compared to the proposed 1D-3C approach, evidencing the influence of the 3C-polarization and the 3-D loading path on strong seismic motions.","(390, 14)","Seismic ground motion modeling is a critical component of earthquake engineering, with far-reaching applications in seismology, structural dynamics, and other fields. In this study, we investigate the relative importance of two key factors in modeling strong seismic ground motion: the three-dimensional loading path and wavefield polarization. Specifically, we compare the results of different simulations for a range of earthquake scenarios, examining both the accuracy of the resulting ground motion predictions and their computational efficiency.

Our analysis reveals that while both loading path and polarization play important roles in ground motion modeling, the relative importance of each varies significantly depending on the specific seismic source and site conditions. In some cases, polarization dominates the resulting ground motion, while in others, the loading path is the primary driving force. These findings have important implications for earthquake engineering, as they suggest that different modeling strategies may be more appropriate for different types of earthquakes and site conditions.

We also investigate the computational performance of various modeling approaches, evaluating their accuracy and efficiency across a range of computational resources. Our results indicate that while more complex models incorporating both loading path and polarization information can improve the accuracy of ground motion predictions, they may also require significant computational resources, making them less practical for real-time earthquake engineering or other applications requiring rapid response times.

Overall, our study highlights the need for a flexible and adaptable approach to ground motion modeling, one that can account for the complex interplay of various factors affecting seismic wave propagation. By advancing our understanding of the relative importance of loading path and polarization, and the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency, our research represents an important step forward in earthquake engineering and related fields.","(314, 10)","Seismic waves due to strong earthquakes propagating in surficial soil layers may both reduce soil 3D loading paths and modify wavefield polarizations. However, the effects of these modifications on seismic ground motion characteristics remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the differences in seismic ground motion characteristics between three-dimensional (3D) loading paths and wavefield polarizations under strong seismic excitations.

To address this research question, a series of numerical simulations were conducted using a 3D finite difference method. The simulations involved modeling the propagation of seismic waves through a layered soil profile with varying degrees of anisotropy and nonlinearity. The results were then compared to those obtained from 1D and 2D simulations to assess the impact of 3D effects on seismic ground motion.

The findings of this study indicate that 3D effects can significantly alter the characteristics of seismic ground motion, particularly in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA), spectral acceleration (SA), and seismic intensity measures (SIMs). In general, 3D simulations resulted in higher PGA and SA values compared to their 1D counterparts, while 2D simulations exhibited intermediate values. Furthermore, the results showed that wavefield polarization has a significant impact on the distribution of seismic energy within the soil profile, leading to variations in PGA and SA across different directions.

The photometry from 2MASS, UCAC3 and SuperCosmos catalogues together with the proper motions from the ","The photometry from 2MASS, UCAC3 and SuperCosmos catalogues together with the proper motions from the Tycho-2, XPM and UCAC3 catalogues are used to select the all-sky samples of 34 white dwarfs, 1996 evolved and 7769 unevolved subdwarfs candidates for R from 9 to 17 magnitude. The samples are separated from the main sequence with admixture less than 10% owing to the detailed analysis of the distribution of the stars in the different color index (CI) vs.

reduced proper motion (RPM) diagrams for various latitudes with special attention to the estimation of admixtures in the samples and with Monte-Carlo simulation. It is shown that the XPM and UCAC3 have the same level of proper motion accuracy. Most of the selected stars has at least 6-band photometry with accuracy is proved to be better than 0.2. The multi-color photometry allows us to eliminate some admixtures and reveal some binaries. The empirical calibrations of absolute magnitude versus CI and RPM for Hipparcos stars give us photometric distances and 3D distribution for all the stars. Although the selection method and uneven distribution of the XPM and UCAC3 data provide noticeable biases the preliminary conclusions are made. The subdwarfs show some concentration to the galactic centre hemisphere with voids because of extinction in the Gould belt and galactic plane. Some yet unexplained overdensities of the evolved subdwarfs are seen in several parts of the sky.

For 183 stars with radial velocities 3D motion and galactic orbits are calculated. For 56 stars with Fe/H collected from various sources we find the relations of the metallicity with CI, asymmetric drift velocity and orbital eccentricity. It is shown that most unevolved subdwarfs belong to the halo with the scale height of $8\pm1$ kpc and local mass density of halo subdwarfs of $2\cdot10^{-5} M\sun pc^{-3}$. Most evolved subdwarfs belong to the thick disk with the scale height of $1.25\pm0.1$ kpc. Main parameters of the selected stars are compiled into new SDWD catalogue for future investigations. Special attention should be paid to spectroscopic observations of these stars because 53% of the selected white dwarfs, 94% of evolved and 98% of unevolved subdwarfs are now classified for the first time whereas the existed spectral classification is wrong in many cases.","(409, 15)","This research paper aims to study subdwarfs and white dwarfs identified from four catalogues: 2MASS, Tycho-2, XPM, and UCAC3. The data for the analysis was compiled from these catalogs and used to characterize the subdwarfs and white dwarfs. The subdwarfs were identified using their kinematic properties, such as the proper motions and the parallaxes.

The 2MASS survey provided the near-infrared magnitudes of the subdwarfs which were used to estimate their metallicity values. A comparison of these values with the previous study results showed that the 2MASS magnitudes were consistent with the previous findings. The Tycho-2 catalog provided the astrometric and photometric data which was used to calculate the subdwarf distances via a statistical method. The XPM catalog provided the data to investigate the proper motions, and the UCAC3 catalog provided the data to check the astrometric solutions from the Tycho-2 and XPM catalogs.

The results reveal that the subdwarf candidates identified from the multi-catalog cross-match, are robust, and have high-confidence astrometric solutions. The distance estimates of the subdwarfs have median distance errors of less than 5%, while their proper motion measurements are precise.

The first activities of the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (""Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc"", LSC) started in ","The first activities of the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (""Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc"", LSC) started in the mid-eighties in a railway tunnel located under the Spanish Pyrenees; since then, it has become an international multidisciplinary facility equipped with different services for underground science. The research activity at LSC is about Astroparticle Physics, dark matter searches and neutrino Physics; but also activities in Nuclear Astrophysics, Geophysics, and Biology are carried out. The investigation of the neutrinoless double beta decay has been one of the main research lines of LSC since the beginning. Many unknowns remain in the characterization of the basic neutrino properties and the study of this rare decay process requiring Physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics can shed light on the lepton number conservation, the nature of the neutrinos as Dirac or Majorana particles and the absolute scale and ordering of the masses of the three generations. Here, the double beta decay searches performed at LSC for different emitters and following very different experimental approaches will be reviewed: from the very first experiments in the laboratory including the successful IGEX for $^{76}$Ge, which released very stringent limits to the effective neutrino mass at the time, to the present NEXT experiment for $^{136}$Xe and future project CROSS (""Cryogenic Rare-event Observatory with Surface Sensitivity"") for $^{130}$Te and $^{100}$Mo, both implementing innovative detector technologies to discriminate backgrounds. For the neutrinoless double beta decay channel and at 90% C.L., IGEX derived a limit to the half-life of $^{76}$Ge of $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 1.57 \times 10^{25}$ y while the corresponding expected limits are $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 1.0\times 10^{26}$ y for $^{136}$Xe from NEXT-100 (for an exposure of 500 kg.y) and $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 2.8 \times 10^{25}$ y for $^{100}$Mo from CROSS (for 5 y and 4.7 kg of isotope). Activities related to double beta decays searches carried out in other underground laboratories have also been developed at LSC and will be presented too, like the operation of the BiPo-3 detector for radiopurity measurements of thin sheets with very high sensitivity. For each one of these experiments, the concept, the experimental set-ups and relevant results will be discussed.","(467, 8)","Double beta decay is a rare nuclear process that has been studied extensively in recent years due to its potential implications for understanding fundamental particles and their interactions. Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC) in Spain has been at the forefront of such studies, with a number of experiments designed to investigate double beta decay processes. 

In this paper, we present results from three different experiments conducted at Canfranc Underground Laboratory: NEXT, EXO-200, and NEMO-3. The aim of these experiments was to search for neutrinoless double beta decay, a hypothesized process that would violate the conservation of lepton number. The experiments utilized a variety of detection technologies, including time projection chambers and high-purity germanium detectors.

The NEXT experiment utilized a large-scale high-pressure xenon gas TPC to search for neutrinoless double beta decay in ^136Xe. The EXO-200 experiment used liquid xenon as a detection medium, and focused on the isotope ^136Xe as well. Finally, NEMO-3, operated between 2002 and 2011, explored several different isotopes, including ^100Mo, ^82Se, and ^150Nd. 

The data obtained from these experiments was analyzed using various statistical techniques. To reduce background noise, the detectors were surrounded by shielding materials such as lead, and additional cuts were made to eliminate events that were likely due to natural radioactivity. Despite these efforts, no significant evidence of neutrinoless double beta decay was found. The resulting limits provide important constraints on the effective Majorana neutrino mass and the electron neutrino mass in different models.

Overall, the double beta decay experiments conducted at Canfranc Underground Laboratory illustrate the utility of underground facilities for rare event searches. The low levels of natural radioactivity and cosmic rays in the underground environment make it possible to achieve unprecedented levels of sensitivity in double beta decay searches. Future experiments will continue to push the limits of our understanding of these rare nuclear processes, and may ultimately shed light on some of the deepest mysteries of the universe.","(354, 15)","The first activities of the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (""Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc"", LSC) started in 1995, with the aim of searching for neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ) in 76Ge. Since then, several experiments have been conducted at the LSC, including the IGEX, NEMO-3, and GERDA experiments. In this paper, we present the results of our latest experiment, which aimed to further investigate the 0νββ process in 76Ge.

Our experiment utilized a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector array, consisting of 30 identical detectors, each with a mass of approximately 1 kg. The detectors were arranged in a modular structure, allowing for easy replacement and upgrade of individual detectors. The HPGe detectors were surrounded by a liquid scintillator veto system, designed to detect and reject background events caused by cosmic rays and other external sources. The entire setup was installed in the LSC, which is located at a depth of approximately 2300 meters, providing a natural shielding against cosmic radiation.

The data acquisition system was designed to record the energy and timing information of each event detected by the HPGe detectors. The data were then analyzed using a combination of offline algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify and reject background events. The analysis focused on the region of interest (ROI) around the expected Q-value of the 0\nu\beta\beta decay in 76Ge, which is approximately 2039 keV.

Our results show that the experimental sensitivity to the 0 ν β β decay in 76 Ge has been significantly improved compared to previous experiments at the LSC. The observed background rate in the ROI is consistent with expectations, and no statistically significant signal has been detected. We have also performed a detailed study of the background sources and their impact on the experiment's sensitivity.

The implications of our results are twofold. Firstly, they provide further constraints on the effective Majorana mass of the neutrino, which is a key parameter in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Secondly, they demonstrate the continued importance of underground laboratories like the LSC in the search for rare nuclear decays, which can provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of neutrinos and the underlying physics of the universe.

Aims. The method of deriving photometric metallicities using red giant branch stars is applied to ","Aims. The method of deriving photometric metallicities using red giant branch stars is applied to resolved stellar populations under the common assumption that they mainly consist of single-age old stellar populations. We explore the effect of the presence of mixed-age stellar populations on deriving photometric metallicities. Methods. We use photometric data sets for the five Galactic dwarf spheroidals Sculptor, Sextans, Carina, Fornax, and Leo II in order to derive their photometric metallicity distribution functions from their resolved red giant branches using isochrones of the Dartmouth Stellar Evolutionary Database. We compare the photometric metallicities with published spectroscopic metallicities based on the analysis of the near-infrared Ca triplet (Ca T), both on the metallicity scale of Carretta & Gratton and on the scale defined by the Dartmouth isochrones. In addition, we compare the photometric metallicities with published spectroscopic metallicities based on spectral synthesis and medium-resolution spectroscopy, and on high resolution spectra where available.

Results. The mean properties of the spectroscopic and photometric metallicity samples are comparable within the intrinsic scatter of each method although the mean metallicities of dSphs with pronounced intermediate-age population fractions may be underestimated by the photometric method by up to a few tenths of dex in [Fe/H]. The star-by-star differences of the spectroscopic minus the photometric metallicities show a wide range of values along the fiducial spectroscopic metallicity range, with the tendency to have systematically lower photometric metallicities for those dwarf spheroidals with a higher fraction of intermediate-age populations. Such discrepancies persist even in the case of the purely old Sculptor dSph, where one would na\""ively expect a very good match when comparing with medium or low resolution metallicity measurements.

Overall, the agreement between Ca T metallicities and photometric metallicities is very good in the metallicity range from ~ -2 dex to ~ -1.5 dex. We find that the photometric method is reliable in galaxies that contain small (less than 15%) intermediate-age stellar fractions. Therefore, in the presence of mixed-age stellar populations, one needs to quantify the fraction of the intermediate-age stars in order to assess their effect on determining metallicities from photometry alone. Finally, we note that the comparison of spectroscopic metallicities of the same stars obtained with different methods reveals similarly large discrepancies as the comparison with photometric metallicities.","(410, 15)","This study investigates the comparison between the spectroscopic and photometric metallicities in the context of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal companion galaxies. The metallicities provide valuable insights into the physical properties and evolutionary history of the galaxies. We analyzed the spectra and photometric data of a sample of nine Milky Way dwarf galaxies using the Calcium II triplet and the Washington photometric system, respectively.

Our results show that the photometric metallicities tend to be higher than the spectroscopic metallicities for the majority of the galaxies. However, we also find a significant scatter in the differences between the two methods. We examine possible sources of systematic errors, such as age uncertainties, non-uniform distributions of alpha-elements, and the presence of multiple populations, but they do not appear to fully explain the differences.

Furthermore, we investigate the impact of metallicity differences on the interpretation of galaxy properties. We find that the differences are particularly important for the interpretation of the abundance ratios of different elements, such as magnesium and iron. In addition, our results suggest that photometric metallicities may have an impact on the inferred dark matter content of the galaxies.

Finally, we use these findings to discuss the prospects of using the spectroscopic and photometric metallicities in future surveys. Our study emphasizes the importance of a careful analysis of the metallicities and their uncertainties, and the need for complementary methods to fully understand the peculiarities of individual galaxies. We conclude that future surveys should aim for a combination of spectroscopic and photometric metallicities, supplemented with other observables, to provide a comprehensive picture of the physical properties and evolution of galaxies.","(292, 12)","Aims. The method of deriving photometric metallicities using red giant branch stars is applied to 14 Milky Way dwarf spheroidal companions, and the results are compared to spectroscopic metallicities obtained from individual stars. This study aims to assess the reliability of photometric metallicities as a proxy for spectroscopic metallicities in these low-mass galaxies.

Methodology. Photometric metallicities were derived using the calcium triplet (CaT) method, which relies on the strength of the CaT lines in the near-infrared spectra of red giant branch stars. Spectroscopic metallicities were obtained from high-resolution spectra of individual stars using the equivalent width of the Ca II K line. The sample consists of 14 dwarf spheroidals, including Fornax, Sculptor, and Leo I, which are among the most well-studied companions of the Milky Way.

Results. The comparison between photometric and spectroscopic metallicities reveals a systematic offset, with photometric metallicities being higher than spectroscopic metallicities by an average of 0.2 dex. However, the scatter between the two methods is significant, with a standard deviation of 0.3 dex. The offset and scatter are found to be dependent on the metallicity of the galaxy, with higher-metallicity galaxies showing a larger offset and scatter. Furthermore, the photometric metallicities are found to be more sensitive to the quality of the photometry than the spectroscopic metallicities.

Discussion. The results of this study suggest that photometric metallicities derived using the CaT method may not be reliable proxies for spectroscopic metallicites, especially in high-metallicity galaxies. The systematic offset and scatter may be due to various factors, including the sensitivity of the CaT method to changes in temperature and gravity, as well as the difficulty in obtaining accurate photometry in crowded fields. The implications of these findings are significant, as photometric metallicities have been widely used to study the properties of distant galaxies and galaxy clusters.

We report on a sensitive search for H2 1-0 S(1), 1-0 S(0) and 2-1 S(1) ","We report on a sensitive search for H2 1-0 S(1), 1-0 S(0) and 2-1 S(1) ro-vibrational emission at 2.12, 2.22 and 2.25 micron in a sample of 15 Herbig Ae/Be stars employing CRIRES, the ESO-VLT near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph, at R~90,000. We detect the H2 1-0 S(1) line toward HD 100546 and HD 97048. In the other 13 targets, the line is not detected. The H2 1-0 S(0) and 2-1 S(1) lines are undetected in all sources. This is the first detection of near-IR H2 emission in HD 100546. The H2 1-0 S(1) lines observed in HD 100546 and HD 97048 are observed at a velocity consistent with the rest velocity of both stars, suggesting that they are produced in the circumstellar disk. In HD 97048, the emission is spatially resolved and it is observed to extend at least up to 200 AU. We report an increase of one order of magnitude in the H2 1-0 S(1) line flux with respect to previous measurements taken in 2003 for this star, which suggests line variability. In HD 100546 the emission is tentatively spatially resolved and may extend at least up to 50 AU. Modeling of the H2 1-0 S(1) line profiles and their spatial extent with flat keplerian disks shows that most of the emission is produced at a radius >5 AU. Upper limits to the H2 1-0 S(0)/ 1-0 S(1) and H2 2-1 S(1)/1-0 S(1) line ratios in HD 97048 are consistent with H2 gas at T>2000 K and suggest that the emission observed may be produced by X-ray excitation. The upper limits for the line ratios for HD 100546 are inconclusive. Because the H2 emission is located at large radii, for both sources a thermal emission scenario (i.e., gas heated by collisions with dust) is implausible. We argue that the observation of H2 emission at large radii may be indicative of an extended disk atmosphere at radii >5 AU. This may be explained by a hydrostatic disk in which gas and dust are thermally decoupled or by a disk wind caused by photoevaporation.","(415, 15)","This paper presents the results of our survey for near-infrared H2 emission in two Herbig Ae/Be stars, HD 97048 and HD 100546, with the goal of studying the emission from the outer disks. Using the high-resolution spectra obtained with the CRIRES instrument at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, we have detected the H2 emission lines in both stars and have analyzed their line profiles and spatial distributions.

In HD 97048, we have detected H2 emission in the red-shifted line wing, extending up to at least 500 AU from the central star. The line profile shows a double-peaked structure, indicating that the emission arises from a rotating disk. We have also detected H2 emission in the blue-shifted line wing, although at a lower significance level.

In HD 100546, we have detected H2 emission in the blue-shifted line wing, extending up to at least 200 AU from the central star. The line profile shows a single-peaked structure, suggesting that the emission arises from an infalling/outflowing gas. We have not detected H2 emission in the red-shifted line wing, which may indicate an inclination effect or a lower gas density in that part of the disk.

We have modeled the H2 emission using a simple disk model and have derived the physical parameters of the emitting gas. For HD 97048, we find that the disk is inclined by about 50 degrees with respect to the line of sight and has a size of about 600 AU. The gas temperature and density are estimated to be about 1000 K and 10^7 cm^-3, respectively. For HD 100546, we find that the emitting gas has a temperature of about 1500 K and a density of about 10^8 cm^-3.

Our results are consistent with the scenario that the H2 emission in Herbig Ae/Be stars arises from the hot and dense gas in the outer disks, near the dust sublimation radius. The disk structure and properties inferred from the H2 emission provide important constraints on the accretion and outflow processes in these objects. Further observations and modeling are needed to fully understand the physical nature of the emitting gas and its relation to the disk structure and evolution.","(392, 15)","We report on a sensitive search for H2 1-0 S(1), 1-0 S(0) and 2-1 S(1)  near-infrared emission lines in a sample of Herbig Ae (HAe) and Herbig Be (HBe) stars using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This study aims to investigate the presence of H2 emission in the outer disks of HAe and HBe stars, which can provide valuable insights into the physical and chemical processes occurring in these regions.

We employed a combination of spectroscopic and imaging techniques to search for H2 emission lines in the near-infrared spectra of our targets. The VLT observations were carried out using the ESPaDOnS and X-Shooter spectrographs, while the ALMA data were obtained using the Band 6 and Band 7 receivers. We analyzed the data using a range of techniques, including spectral line fitting, continuum subtraction, and image processing.

Our results show that H2 emission is detected in the outer disk of the HAe star HD 97048, but not in the HBe star HD 100546. The H2 emission in HD 97048 is found to be spatially extended, suggesting that it originates from the outer disk. We also detect H2 emission in several other HAe stars in our sample, although the emission is generally weaker and more variable than in HD 970048. In contrast, we do not detect any significant H2 emission in our sample of HBe stars.

We propose a novel theoretical biomolecular design to implement any Boolean circuit using the mechanism ","We propose a novel theoretical biomolecular design to implement any Boolean circuit using the mechanism of DNA strand displacement. The design is scalable: all species of DNA strands can in principle be mixed and prepared in a single test tube, rather than requiring separate purification of each species, which is a barrier to large-scale synthesis. The design is time-responsive: the concentration of output species changes in response to the concentration of input species, so that time-varying inputs may be continuously processed. The design is digital: Boolean values of wires in the circuit are represented as high or low concentrations of certain species, and we show how to construct a single-input, single-output signal restoration gate that amplifies the difference between high and low, which can be distributed to each wire in the circuit to overcome signal degradation. This means we can achieve a digital abstraction of the analog values of concentrations. Finally, the design is energy-efficient: if input species are specified ideally (meaning absolutely 0 concentration of unwanted species), then output species converge to their ideal concentrations at steady-state, and the system at steady-state is in (dynamic) equilibrium, meaning that no energy is consumed by irreversible reactions until the input again changes.

Drawbacks of our design include the following. If input is provided non-ideally (small positive concentration of unwanted species), then energy must be continually expended to maintain correct output concentrations even at steady-state. In addition, our fuel species - those species that are permanently consumed in irreversible reactions - are not ""generic""; each gate in the circuit is powered by its own specific type of fuel species. Hence different circuits must be powered by different types of fuel. Finally, we require input to be given according to the dual-rail convention, so that an input of 0 is specified not only by the absence of a certain species, but by the presence of another. That is, we do not construct a ""true NOT gate"" that sets its output to high concentration if and only if its input's concentration is low. It remains an open problem to design scalable, time-responsive, digital, energy-efficient molecular circuits that additionally solve one of these problems, or to prove that some subset of their resolutions are mutually incompatible.","(420, 13)","In this paper, we propose a novel approach to designing and implementing digital molecular circuits using DNA strand displacement. Our approach leverages recent advances in DNA nanotechnology and biochemistry to create circuits that are both scalable in size and energy-efficient in operation.

The key idea behind our approach is to use the unique properties of DNA molecules to implement circuit elements such as logic gates and signal amplifiers. Specifically, we take advantage of the specific binding properties of single-stranded DNA to design circuits that can be controlled and manipulated through the addition and removal of DNA strands. This allows our circuits to be reprogrammed on the fly and to respond quickly to changes in input signals.

To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we present a set of benchmark circuits that are capable of performing simple computational tasks such as addition and multiplication. These circuits have been simulated using standard circuit simulation tools and have been shown to be both reliable and highly energy-efficient.

We also explore the scalability of our approach by simulating larger circuits composed of multiple logic gates and signal amplifiers. These simulations suggest that our approach can be scaled to implement more complex circuits and systems.

Finally, we compare our approach to other digital molecular circuit designs and show that our circuits are both more energy-efficient and more responsive to changes in input signals. We conclude that our approach holds significant promise for the development of future digital molecular circuits and could lead to the creation of powerful, energy-efficient computing systems that are capable of operating at the molecular scale.","(280, 11)","We propose a novel theoretical biomolecular design to implement any Boolean circuit using the mechanism  of DNA strand displacement (DSD) in a scalable, time-responsive, digital, and energy-efficient manner. Our research aims to address the limitations of existing biomolecular computing approaches, which often suffer from low scalability, long computation times, and high energy consumption.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce a modular and hierarchical design framework for DSD-based molecular circuits. This framework enables the construction of large-scale circuits by combining smaller, pre-designed modules. Each module consists of a set of interacting DNA strands that perform specific computational operations, such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. These modules are then interconnected to form more complex circuits, allowing for the implementation of arbitrary Boolean functions.

A key innovation of our approach is the incorporation of a time-responsive mechanism, which enables the circuit to adapt its computation speed in response to changing environmental conditions. This is achieved through the introduction of a feedback loop that monitors the circuit's progress and adjusts the reaction rates accordingly. As a result, the circuit can dynamically adjust its computation time to match the requirements of the specific application, ensuring optimal performance and energy efficiency.

Our design also incorporates a digital logic framework, which allows for the precise control of molecular interactions and the elimination of analog noise. This is accomplished through the use of toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions, which enable the selective binding and release of DNA strands. By carefully designing the toehold sequences and reaction conditions, we can ensure that the molecular interactions occur in a highly controlled and predictable manner, resulting in accurate and reliable computation.

In addition to scalability, time-responsiveness, and digital logic, our design also prioritizes energy efficiency. We achieve this through the use of a minimal set of reaction components and the optimization of reaction conditions to minimize energy consumption. By carefully balancing the reaction rates and concentrations, we can reduce the overall energy expenditure of the circuit while maintaining its computational performance.

These circuits include a 4-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a 16-bit multiplier, and a 32-bit adder-subtractor. Our results show that these circuits can perform complex computations with high accuracy and speed, while consuming significantly less energy than traditional electronic circuits.

----- Ettore Majorana: Un cenno alle sue Opere (e Vita). Il secondo articolo rappresenta la versione italiana di parte del seminario su invito tenuto dall'autore alla ""Internat.Conf.Majorana's Legacy and Phys. of XXI Century"" che ha avuto luogo nell'ottobre 2006 presso il Dip. di Fis. della Univ. di Catania: Conferenza organizzata per celebrare il centenario della nascita (a Catania) del fisico teorico Ettore Majorana; probabilmente il piu` geniale teorico italiano del XX secolo (Enrico Fermi lo considero` il piu` brillante del suo tempo nel mondo), anche se a qualcuno Majorana e` ancora noto soprattutto per la sua misteriosa scomparsa, avvenuta nel 1938, quando aveva 31 anni. In questo scritto descriviamo in sintesi tanto il significato delle sue piu` importanti pubblicazioni, quanto la sua vita: i dati biografici essendo basati su lettere, documenti, testimonianze scoperti o raccolti dall'autore durante quasi 30 anni, e contenuti nel libro di E.Recami: ""Il Caso Majorana: Epistolario, Testimonianze, Documenti"" (pubblicato inizialmente da Mondadori, Milano, nel 1987 e 1991, e al presente pubblicato, nel 2002, da Di Renzo Editore, Roma: http://www.direnzo.it). Infine, si aggiungono informazioni e commenti circa i manoscritti scientifici lasciti inediti dal Majorana.","(465, 13)","This paper delves into the fascinating scientific and human persona of the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana. His contributions to the field of theoretical physics span across a broad range of topics including atomic and nuclear physics, quantum mechanics, and particle physics. Majorana's scientific output was intense and impressive, even if many of his ideas were left undeveloped due to his mysterious disappearance.

Beyond Majorana's scientific achievements, his personality was characterized by a deep introspection and fascination with philosophical and ethical issues. These aspects of his persona are explored through the analysis of his personal writings and interactions with his contemporaries. One example of his philosophical inquiries is his critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics, which he found incomplete and unsatisfactory.

Majorana's life was cut short by his sudden disappearance in 1938 under mysterious circumstances, which have remained a source of speculation and fascination among his colleagues and biographers. Nevertheless, his intellectual legacy has continued to influence theoretical physics, especially in the field of neutrino physics. His hypotheses on neutrino mass and oscillations have been confirmed by experimental evidence, although much of his work on particle physics remains unexplored.

Overall, Majorana's scientific and human personalities are intertwined; his intense intellectual curiosity and inner life greatly contributed to his contributions to physics. His disappearance is still a source of fascination, which has inspired artistic and literary works. Ultimately, Majorana's pioneering work in theoretical physics and his enigmatic persona will continue to captivate scientists and laypeople alike, ensuring his place in the annals of science and culture.","(287, 12)","This article, in English, represents part of the invited talk delivered by the author at 4th International Conference on Theoretical Physics, held in Varenna, Italy, in 1955. Ettore Majorana, an Italian theoretical physicist, was born in 1906 in Catania, Sicily, and died in 1938 at the age of 31 under mysterious circumstances. Despite his short career, Majorana made significant contributions to the field of theoretical physics, particularly in the areas of quantum mechanics and particle physics. This paper aims to provide an in-depth analysis of Majorana's scientific and human personality, shedding light on the factors that contributed to his remarkable achievements and tragic demise.

The methodology employed in this study involves a comprehensive review of Majorana's published works, including his papers on quantum mechanics, particle physics, and electromagnetism. Additionally, archival research was conducted to gather information about Majorana's personal life, including his family background, education, and relationships. Interviews with colleagues and acquaintances who knew Majorana personally were also conducted to gain a deeper understanding of his personality and behavior.

The findings of this study suggest that Majorana's scientific personality was characterized by a unique combination of intellectual curiosity, creativity, and rigor. His work on quantum mechanics, in particular, demonstrated a deep understanding of the subject matter and a willingness to challenge established theories. Majorana's contributions to particle physics, including the prediction of the existence of antiparticles, were also groundbreaking and influential. Furthermore, his work on electromagnetism showed a keen understanding of the subject and a ability to apply mathematical techniques to solve complex problems.

In addition to his scientific achievements, Majorana's human personality was marked by a number of distinctive traits. He was known to be introverted and reserved, preferring the company of a few close friends to large social gatherings. Majorana was also deeply committed to his work, often spending long hours in the laboratory or studying late into the night. Despite his intense focus on his research, Majorana was also known to be kind and compassionate, particularly towards his students and colleagues.

The implications of this study are far-reaching and multifaceted. On the one hand, Majorana's scientific achievements serve as a testament to the power of human ingenuity and creativity.

We call such a pair a {\it tridiagonal pair} on $V$. It is known that $d=\delta$ and for $0 \leq i \leq d$ the dimensions of $V_i$, $V_{d-i}$, $V^*_i$, $V^*_{d-i}$ coincide. The pair $A,A^*$ is called {\it sharp} whenever $\dim V_0=1$. It is known that if $K$ is algebraically closed then $A,A^*$ is sharp. Assuming $A,A^*$ is sharp, we use the data $\Phi=(A; \{V_i\}{i=0}^d; A^*; \{V^*_i\}{i=0}^d)$ to define a polynomial $P$ in one variable and degree at most $d$. We show that $P$ remains invariant if $\Phi$ is replaced by $(A;\{V_{d-i}\}{i=0}^d; A^*; \{V^*_i\}{i=0}^d)$ or $(A;\{V_i\}{i=0}^d; A^*; \{V^*_{d-i}\}{i=0}^d)$ or $(A^*; \{V^*_i\}{i=0}^d; A; \{V_i\}{i=0}^d)$. We call $P$ the {\it Drinfel'd polynomial} of $A,A^*$. We explain how $P$ is related to the classical Drinfel'd polynomial from the theory of Lie algebras and quantum groups. We expect that the roots of $P$ will be useful in a future classification of the sharp tridiagonal pairs.

Endow $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ with the Hamming metric, i.e., with the metric induced by the $\ell_1^n$ norm when one identifies $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ with $\{0,1\}^n\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Denote by $\ell_2^n(\mathbb{F}_2^n)$ the $n$-fold Pythagorean product of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$, i.e., the space of all $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in \prod_{j=1}^n \mathbb{F}_2^n$, equipped with the metric $$ \forall\, x,y\in \prod_{j=1}^n \mathbb{F}_2^n,\qquad d_{\ell_2^n(\mathbb{F}_2^n)}(x,y)= \sqrt{ \|x_1-y_1\|_1^2+\ldots+\|x_n-y_n\|_1^2}. $$ It is shown here that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of any embedding of $\ell_2^n(\mathbb{F}_2^n)$ into $L_1$ is at least a constant multiple of $\sqrt{n}$. This is achieved through the following new bi-Lipschitz invariant, which is a metric version of (a slight variant of) a linear inequality of Kwapie{\'n} and Sch\""utt (1989).

Letting $\{e_{jk}\}_{j,k\in \{1,\ldots,n\}}$ denote the standard basis of the space of all $n$ by $n$ matrices $M_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$, say that a metric space $(X,d_X)$ is a KS space if there exists $C=C(X)>0$ such that for every $n\in 2\mathbb{N}$, every mapping $f:M_n(\mathbb{F}_2)\to X$ satisfies \begin{equation*}\label{eq:metric KS abstract} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n\mathbb{E}\left[d_X\Big(f\Big(x+\sum_{k=1}^ne_{jk}\Big),f(x)\Big)\right]\le C \mathbb{E}\left[d_X\Big(f\Big(x+\sum_{j=1}^ne_{jk_j}\Big),f(x)\Big)\right], \end{equation*} where the expectations above are with respect to $x\in M_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $k=(k_1,\ldots,k_n)\in \{1,\ldots,n\}^n$ chosen uniformly at random. It is shown here that $L_1$ is a KS space (with $C= 2e^2/(e^2-1)$, which is best possible), implying the above nonembeddability statement. Links to the Ribe program are discussed, as well as related open problems.","(567, 8)","This paper focuses on the study of Pythagorean powers of hypercubes, which involves analyzing the relationship between the Pythagorean theorem and the geometry of hypercubes. We investigate the properties of these unique mathematical objects, including their dimensions, volumes, and coordinates, in order to gain a deeper understanding of their behavior and applications.

To begin, we establish the definition of a hypercube as a higher-dimensional analogue of a square or cube, with each additional dimension forming an orthogonal axis to the previous ones. This allows us to generalize the Pythagorean theorem to higher dimensions, where the sum of the squares of the lengths of the edges of a hypercube equals the square of its diagonal length. Using this formula, we derive the formula for the volume of a hypercube, which is given by the product of its edge lengths raised to the power of the number of dimensions.

Next, we investigate the Pythagorean powers of hypercubes, which involve expressing the diagonal length of a hypercube as an integer multiple of its edge length using Pythagorean triples. We explore the relationship between hypercubes and Pythagorean triples in detail, noting that only certain hypercube dimensions can have Pythagorean powers.

We also examine the properties of hypercubes with Pythagorean powers, including their volume and coordinates. We demonstrate that these hypercubes have special properties that make them useful in a variety of mathematical and scientific disciplines, including physics, cryptography, and computer science.

On the other hand, the Boltzmann equation is applied for the rarefied gas dynamics. Both equations are constructed from modeling flow physics in different scales. Fortunately, due to the distinct separation of scales, i.e., the hydrodynamic and kinetic ones, both Navier-Stokes equations and the Boltzmann equation are valid in their respectable domains. However, in real physical application, there may not have such a distinctive scale separation. For example, around a hypersonic flying vehicle, the flow physics at different regions may correspond to different regimes, where the local Knudsen number can be changed in several order of magnitudes. With a variation of modeling scale, theoretically a continuous governing equation from kinetic Boltzmann equation to the hydrodynamic Navier-Stokes equations should exist. However, due to the difficulties of a direct modeling of flow physics in the scale between the kinetic and hydrodynamic ones, there is basically no reliable theory or valid governing equation to cover the whole transition regime. In fact, it is an unresolved problem about the exact scale for the validity of the NS equations as Reynolds number decreases. The traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is based on the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDE), and it targets on the recovering of the exact solution of the PDEs as mesh size and time step converging to zero. This methodology can be hardly applied here because there is no such a complete PDE for flow physics in all scales. It may be the time to combine the modeling and computation together without going through the process of constructing PDEs. In other words, the CFD research is not only to obtain the numerical solution of governing equation, but also to construct a valid discrete governing equation to identify the flow physics in the mesh size and time step scales. In this paper, we are going to present the idea for the modeling and computation. This methodology leads to the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for flow simulation in all flow regimes. Based on UGKS, the boundary for the validation of the Navier-Stokes equations can be quantitatively evaluated. The combination of modeling and computation provides a paradigm for the description of multiscale transport process.","(420, 17)","The aim of this paper is to propose a new paradigm for modeling and computation of gas dynamics, which enables the simulation of complex gas flow phenomena. Gas dynamics is a fundamental topic in fluid mechanics, providing insight into the behavior of gases and their interactions with solid surfaces. The proposed paradigm is based on the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, coupled with advanced mathematical modeling, to gain a deeper understanding of gas dynamics.

The proposed paradigm is divided into two main stages: modeling and computation. In the modeling stage, the gas flow is characterized using mathematical models that describe the physical behavior of the gas. This modeling allows for the identification of key variables that affect the behavior of the gas, which are then incorporated into numerical simulations. The simulation stage involves the application of CFD techniques to solve the governing equations of the modeled system, producing time-dependent solutions that capture the dynamics of the gas flow.

The proposed paradigm presents a number of advantages over traditional modeling and computation methods. Firstly, it allows for the modeling of complex gas flow systems, including those with multiple physical phenomena and non-linearities. This is achieved through the use of advanced mathematical models that capture the underlying physics of the system. Secondly, the paradigm offers increased computational efficiency, enabling faster simulation of gas dynamics phenomena. This is achieved through the use of parallel computing techniques and optimized numerical algorithms.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed paradigm, several examples are presented, including the simulation of supersonic flows, combustion processes and chemical reactions. In each case, the proposed paradigm produces accurate results, providing valuable insight into the underlying behavior of the system. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed paradigm outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and scalability.

In conclusion, the proposed paradigm offers an innovative approach to the modeling and computation of gas dynamics phenomena. Its use represents an important step towards a deeper understanding of complex gas flow systems and their interactions with the environment, with significant applications in a variety of fields, from aerospace engineering to energy production and environmental science.","(397, 17)","In the continuum flow regime, the Navier-Stokes equations are usually used for the description of 3D gas dynamics. However, due to their non-linearity and high dimensionality, solving these equations analytically remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for modeling and computation of gas dynamics, which leverages recent advances in machine learning (ML) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Our research question is: Can we develop a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of ML and CFD to provide accurate and efficient solutions for complex gas dynamics problems? To address this question, we first review the state-of-the-art in both ML and CFD, highlighting their respective limitations and potential synergies.

The PINN architecture is designed to learn the underlying physics of the gas dynamics from a set of training data, which can be obtained from experiments, numerical simulations, or a combination of both. The network is trained using a physics-informed loss function, which enforces the satisfaction of the governing equations and boundary conditions. This approach allows us to model complex gas dynamics phenomena, such as shock waves, turbulence, and multiphase flows, with high accuracy and efficiency.

The meshfree CFD solver is based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, which is particularly well-suited for simulating complex flows with moving boundaries and interfaces. The SPH solver is coupled with the PINN architecture through a hybrid optimization framework, which minimizes the difference between the ML predictions and the CFD simulations. This framework enables us to leverage the strengths of both approaches, namely the accuracy and efficiency of ML and the robustness and physical fidelity of CFD.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm through a series of numerical experiments, including the simulation of a supersonic flow over a wedge, a turbulent flow in a channel, and a multiphase flow in a pipe. Our results show that the hybrid approach provides significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional CFD methods, while maintaining the physical fidelity and robustness of the SPH solver.

Context: An island parser reads an input text and builds the parse (or abstract syntax) ","Context: An island parser reads an input text and builds the parse (or abstract syntax) tree of only the programming constructs of interest in the text. These constructs are called islands and the rest of the text is called water, which the parser ignores and skips over. Since an island parser does not have to parse all the details of the input, it is often easy to develop but still useful enough for a number of software engineering tools. When a parser generator is used, the developer can implement an island parser by just describing a small number of grammar rules, for example, in Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG).

Inquiry: In practice, however, the grammar rules are often complicated since the developer must define the water inside the island; otherwise, the island parsing will not reduce the total number of grammar rules. When describing the grammar rules for such water, the developer must consider other rules and enumerate a set of symbols, which we call alternative symbols. Due to this difficulty, island parsing seems to be not widely used today despite its usefulness in many applications.

Approach: This paper proposes the lake symbols for addressing this difficulty in developing an island parser. It also presents an extension to PEG for supporting the lake symbols. The lake symbols automate the enumeration of the alternative symbols for the water inside an island. The paper proposes an algorithm for translating the extended PEG to the normal PEG, which can be given to an existing parser generator based on PEG.

Knowledge: The user can use lake symbols to define water without specifying each alternative symbol. Our algorithms can calculate all alternative symbols for a lake symbol, based on where the lake symbol is used in the grammar.

Grounding: We implemented a parser generator accepting our extended PEG and implemented 36 island parsers for Java and 20 island parsers for Python. Our experiments show that the lake symbols reduce 42 % of grammar rules for Java and 89 % of rules for Python on average, excluding the case where islands are expressions.

Importance: This work eases the use of island parsing. Lake symbols enable the user to define the water inside the island simpler than before. Defining water inside the island is essential to apply island parsing for practical programming languages.","(428, 18)","The process of parsing natural language is an important task that has been studied extensively in the field of computational linguistics. Island parsing is a specific type of parsing that involves breaking up a sentence into distinct islands, where each island is a self-contained unit of meaning. In this paper, we explore the use of lake symbols as a way of improving the accuracy of island parsing.

Lake symbols are a type of semantic annotation that can be used to mark the boundaries of distinct islands within a sentence. By incorporating lake symbols into island parsing algorithms, we can more accurately identify the boundaries between islands and hence improve the overall accuracy of the parsing process. We present a comprehensive analysis of the use of lake symbols in island parsing and demonstrate their effectiveness through a series of experiments on a large corpus of natural language texts.

Our results show that incorporating lake symbols into island parsing algorithms can significantly improve their accuracy, particularly for complex sentences with multiple islands. We provide a detailed analysis of the errors made by traditional island parsing algorithms and show how these errors can be avoided through the use of lake symbols. We also discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and suggest several directions for future research.

Overall, our work demonstrates the utility of lake symbols in improving the accuracy of island parsing algorithms. By providing a more precise way of marking the boundaries between islands, lake symbols can help to overcome many of the limitations of traditional island parsing techniques. We believe that this work will be of great interest to researchers in the field of computational linguistics who are interested in improving the accuracy and efficiency of natural language processing systems.","(308, 12)","Context: An island parser reads an input text and builds the parse (or abstract syntax)  tree of that text.

Research Question: How can lake symbols be used to improve the robustness and accuracy of island parsing in the presence of ambiguous or incomplete input texts?

Methodology: Our approach involves introducing lake symbols as a new type of symbol in the grammar of the island parser.

The quantified constraint satisfaction problem $\mathrm{QCSP}(\mathcal{A})$ is the problem to decide whether a positive Horn ","The quantified constraint satisfaction problem $\mathrm{QCSP}(\mathcal{A})$ is the problem to decide whether a positive Horn sentence, involving nothing more than the two quantifiers and conjunction, is true on some fixed structure $\mathcal{A}$. We study two containment problems related to the QCSP. Firstly, we give a combinatorial condition on finite structures $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ that is necessary and sufficient to render $\mathrm{QCSP}(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \mathrm{QCSP}(\mathcal{B})$. We prove that $\mathrm{QCSP}(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \mathrm{QCSP}(\mathcal{B})$, that is all sentences of positive Horn logic true on $\mathcal{A}$ are true on $\mathcal{B}$, iff there is a surjective homomorphism from $\mathcal{A}^{|A|^{|B|}}$ to $\mathcal{B}$. This can be seen as improving an old result of Keisler that shows the former equivalent to there being a surjective homomorphism from $\mathcal{A}^\omega$ to $\mathcal{B}$. We note that this condition is already necessary to guarantee containment of the $\Pi_2$ restriction of the QCSP, that is $\Pi_2$-$\mathrm{CSP}(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \Pi_2$-$\mathrm{CSP}(\mathcal{B})$. The exponent's bound of ${|A|^{|B|}}$ places the decision procedure for the model containment problem in non-deterministic double-exponential time complexity. We further show the exponent's bound $|A|^{|B|}$ to be close to tight by giving a sequence of structures $\mathcal{A}$ together with a fixed $\mathcal{B}$, $|B|=2$, such that there is a surjective homomorphism from $\mathcal{A}^r$ to $\mathcal{B}$ only when $r \geq |A|$. Secondly, we prove that the entailment problem for positive Horn fragment of first-order logic is decidable. That is, given two sentences $\varphi$ and $\psi$ of positive Horn, we give an algorithm that determines whether $\varphi \rightarrow \psi$ is true in all structures (models). Our result is in some sense tight, since we show that the entailment problem for positive first-order logic (i.e. positive Horn plus disjunction) is undecidable. In the final part of the paper we ponder a notion of Q-core that is some canonical representative among the class of templates that engender the same QCSP. Although the Q-core is not as well-behaved as its better known cousin the core, we demonstrate that it is still a useful notion in the realm of QCSP complexity classifications.","(539, 14)","This research paper delves into the study of quantified constraints and containment problems, focusing on their application and impact in various fields, including computer science, engineering, and mathematics.

It is thus crucial to map the distribution and investigate the formation of simple organics, such as formaldehyde and methanol, in protoplanetary disks. We analyze ALMA observations of the nearby disk-jet system around the T Tauri star DG Tau in the o-H$_2$CO $3_{1,2}-2_{1,1}$ and CH$_3$OH $3_{-2,2}-4_{-1,4}$ E, $5_{0,5}-4_{0,4}$ A transitions at an unprecedented resolution of $\sim0.15""$, i.e., $\sim18$ au at a distance of 121 pc. The H$_2$CO emission originates from a rotating ring extending from $\sim40$ au with a peak at $\sim62$ au, i.e., at the edge of the 1.3mm dust continuum. CH$_3$OH emission is not detected down to an r.m.s. of 3 mJy/beam in the 0.162 km/s channel. Assuming an ortho-to-para ratio of 1.8-2.8 the ring- and disk-height-averaged H$_2$CO column density is $\sim0.3-4\times10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, while that of CH$_3$OH is $<0.04-0.7\times10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$. In the inner $40$ au no o-H$_2$CO emission is detected with an upper limit on its beam-averaged column density of $\sim0.5-6\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. The H$_2$CO ring in the disk of DG Tau is located beyond the CO iceline (R$_{\rm CO}\sim30$ au). This suggests that the H$_2$CO abundance is enhanced in the outer disk due to formation on grain surfaces by the hydrogenation of CO ice. The emission peak at the edge of the mm dust continuum may be due to enhanced desorption of H$_2$CO in the gas phase caused by increased UV penetration and/or temperature inversion. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO abundance ratio is $<1$, in agreement with disk chemistry models. The inner edge of the H$_2$CO ring coincides with the radius where the polarization of the dust continuum changes orientation, hinting at a tight link between the H$_2$CO chemistry and the dust properties in the outer disk and at the possible presence of substructures in the dust distribution.","(460, 13)","The detection of organic molecules in protoplanetary disks provides valuable insights into the early stages of planet formation. In this study, we present high-resolution ALMA observations of the protoplanetary disk around DG Tau, a T Tauri star located in the Taurus molecular cloud. Our observations reveal the presence of several complex organic molecules, including CH3OH, HCOOCH3, and HC3N, in the disk. 

We performed a detailed analysis of the spatial and spectral distribution of these molecules to investigate their origin and chemical processes in the disk. We find that the organic molecules are concentrated in the midplane of the disk, where the bulk of the dust and gas is located. The emission from CH3OH is particularly strong in the inner regions of the disk, suggesting that it originates from warm gas close to the central star. On the other hand, HC3N and HCOOCH3 show a more extended distribution, which could be due to their formation on dust grains and subsequent desorption into the gas phase.

We also compared our observations with chemical models of protoplanetary disks to investigate the chemical processes that could be responsible for the observed organic molecules. Our results indicate that the observed abundance and distribution of CH3OH and HC3N can be reproduced by gas-phase chemistry alone, while HCOOCH3 requires the inclusion of grain-surface chemistry.

Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The detection of complex organic molecules in protoplanetary disks suggests that the building blocks of life may be present during the early stages of planet formation. Furthermore, the distribution and abundance of these molecules provide valuable constraints on the physical and chemical conditions of the disk, which can help to improve our understanding of disk evolution and planet formation processes.

Homozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 11 (CLN11), ","Homozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 11 (CLN11), a rare lysosomal-storage disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, seizures, retinitis pigmentosa, and cognitive disorders, usually beginning between 13 and 25 years of age. This is a rare condition, previously reported in only four families. In contrast, heterozygous GRN mutations are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia associated with neuronal cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. We identified homozygous GRN mutations in six new patients. The phenotypic spectrum is much broader than previously reported, with two remarkably distinct presentations, depending on the age of onset. A childhood/juvenile form is characterized by classical CLN11 symptoms at an early age at onset. Unexpectedly, other homozygous patients presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar ataxia. Another major finding of this study is that all GRN mutations may not have the same impact on progranulin protein synthesis. A hypomorphic effect of some mutations is supported by the presence of residual levels of plasma progranulin and low levels of normal transcript detected in one case with a homozygous splice-site mutation and late onset frontotemporal dementia. This is a new critical finding that must be considered in therapeutic trials based on replacement strategies. The first neuropathological study in a homozygous carrier provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of the disease.

Hallmarks of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were present. The absence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions markedly differs from observations of heterozygous mutations, suggesting a pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43 pathologies depending on the mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing observation was the loss of normal TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some neurons, which could be the first stage of the TDP-43 pathological process preceding the formation of typical cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study has important implications for genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis.

Semi-dominant inheritance of GRN mutations implies that specific genetic counseling should be delivered to children and parents of CLN11 patients, as they are heterozygous carriers with a high risk of developing dementia. More broadly, this study illustrates the fact that genetic variants can lead to different phenotypes according to their mono- or bi-allelic state, which is a challenge for genetic diagnosis.","(408, 17)","Homozygous mutations in GRN gene have been associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). However, recent studies have reported unexpected phenotypes in patients carrying homozygous GRN mutations, including white matter abnormalities and stroke-like episodes. These findings indicate a broader phenotypic spectrum than previously thought and suggest that GRN mutations can affect multiple regions of the brain.

The pathological and molecular mechanisms underlying these unexpected phenotypes are not yet fully understood. However, recent studies have shed new light on the mechanisms underlying FTLD and NCL. One proposed mechanism is the loss of progranulin (PGRN), the protein encoded by the GRN gene, which plays a key role in neuronal survival, inflammation, and lysosomal function. Studies have shown that PGRN deficiency leads to lysosomal dysfunction and accumulation of lipofuscin in lysosomes, which may contribute to neurodegeneration.

Another proposed mechanism is the accumulation of TDP-43, a protein that is normally localized in the nucleus but accumulates in the cytoplasm in patients with FTLD. Studies have suggested that PGRN deficiency may lead to TDP-43 accumulation by reducing autophagy and enhancing protein aggregation.

In addition, recent studies have implicated altered microglial activation in the pathogenesis of FTLD and NCL. Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, play a key role in neuroinflammation and phagocytosis of proteins and cellular debris. Altered microglial activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of FTLD and NCL by promoting neuroinflammation and impairing protein degradation.

In conclusion, homozygous GRN mutations have been associated with a broad phenotypic spectrum, including unexpected white matter abnormalities and stroke-like episodes. The underlying pathological and molecular mechanisms are not fully understood but may involve loss of PGRN, accumulation of TDP-43, and altered microglial activation. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying these unexpected phenotypes and to develop novel therapeutic strategies for FTLD and NCL.","(340, 15)","Homozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 11 (CLN11),  a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and premature death.

This study aimed to elucidate the unexpected phenotypes and molecular mechanisms underlying CLN11, with a focus on the role of GRN mutations in disease pathogenesis.

We conducted a comprehensive review of existing literature on CLN11, including case reports, genetic studies, and neuropathological analyses. In addition, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate the effects of GRN mutations on cellular and organismal phenotypes. Our results revealed that homozygous GRM mutations in CLN11 patients exhibit distinct pathological features, including widespread neuronal loss, astrocytosis, and the accumulation of lipofuscin-like inclusions. Notably, these features differ significantly from those observed in FTD and Alzheimer's disease, which are characterized by tau and amyloid-β pathology, respectively.

Our in vitro experiments using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from CLN11 patients demonstrated that GRN mutations lead to reduced progranulin expression and secretion, resulting in impaired autophagy and increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, our in vivo studies using a zebrafish model of CLN11 showed that GRN mutations cause developmental abnormalities, including craniofacial dysmorphia and impaired motor function. These findings suggest that GRN mutations play a critical role in the pathogenesis of CLN11, potentially through disruption of autophagy and oxidative stress pathways.

Let $\mathbf{f} = \left(f_1, \dots, f_p\right) $ be a polynomial tuple in $\mathbb{Q}[z_1, \dots, z_n]$ ","Let $\mathbf{f} = \left(f_1, \dots, f_p\right) $ be a polynomial tuple in $\mathbb{Q}[z_1, \dots, z_n]$ and let $d = \max_{1 \leq i \leq p} \deg f_i$. We consider the problem of computing the set of asymptotic critical values of the polynomial mapping, with the assumption that this mapping is dominant, $\mathbf{f}: z \in \mathbb{K}^n \to (f\_1(z), \dots, f\_p(z)) \in \mathbb{K}^p$ where $\mathbb{K}$ is either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. This is the set of values $c$ in the target space of $\mathbf{f}$ such that there exists a sequence of points $(\mathbf{x}_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ for which $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_i)$ tends to $c$ and $\|\mathbf{x}_i\| \kappa {\rm d} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_i))$ tends to $0$ when $i$ tends to infinity where ${\rm d} \mathbf{f}$ is the differential of $\mathbf{f}$ and $\kappa$ is a function measuring the distance of a linear operator to the set of singular linear operators from $\mathbb{K}^n$ to $\mathbb{K}^p$. Computing the union of the classical and asymptotic critical values allows one to put into practice generalisations of Ehresmann's fibration theorem. This leads to natural and efficient applications in polynomial optimisation and computational real algebraic geometry. Going back to previous works by Kurdyka, Orro and Simon, we design new algorithms to compute asymptotic critical values. Through randomisation, we introduce new geometric characterisations of asymptotic critical values. This allows us to dramatically reduce the complexity of computing such values to a cost that is essentially $O(d^{2n(p+1)})$ arithmetic operations in $\mathbb{Q}$. We also obtain tighter degree bounds on a hypersurface containing the asymptotic critical values, showing that the degree is at most $p^{n-p+1}(d-1)^{n-p}(d+1)^{p}$. Next, we show how to apply these algorithms to unconstrained polynomial optimisation problems and the problem of computing sample points per connected component of a semi-algebraic set defined by a single inequality/inequation. We report on the practical capabilities of our implementation of this algorithm. It shows how the practical efficiency surpasses the current state-of-the-art algorithms for computing asymptotic critical values by tackling examples that were previously out of reach.","(525, 12)","This paper discusses the computation of asymptotic critical values of polynomial maps and their various applications. Polynomial maps possess a plethora of pragmatic applications, making their thorough understanding essential to engineering, mathematics, and physics scholars. The study of their asymptotic behavior is especially important in understanding their analytical properties. Hence, this paper analyzes polynomial maps with a particular focus on their end behavior and corresponding critical points.

The paper first presents a theoretical foundation for polynomial maps, covering basic concepts such as degree, root, and critical point. It then delves into the methods used to compute the asymptotic behavior of the polynomial maps. This includes the use of Euclidean algorithms, Routh-Hurwitz criterions, and other mathematical tools that ensure accurate calculation of the critical values of polynomial maps. The importance of these critical values lies in the fact that they have an impact on the polynomial's overall behavior in the long run.

In addition to the computation of the asymptotic behavior of polynomial maps, this paper also explores the diverse applications of these maps. For example, polynomial maps have been used in cryptography as they possess certain desirable attributes. Within this field, the study of the asymptotic behavior of polynomial maps is especially important in determining their cryptographic security.

Additionally, polynomial maps have also been applied in the study of chemical reactions, population genetics, and other areas. The computational methods explained in this paper provide mathematicians and scientists with an efficient and effective way of understanding and analyzing the asymptotic behavior of these complex maps.

In conclusion, this paper illustrates the importance of the computation of asymptotic critical values of polynomial maps in providing insight into their long-term behavior. The techniques presented in this paper are valuable tools for mathematicians and scientists who wish to study or apply polynomial maps in various fields. Furthermore, the applications of these maps in cryptography, chemical reactions, and population genetics make them an essential area of research in contemporary times.","(361, 16)","Let $\mathbf{f} = \left(f_1, \dots, f_p\right) $ be a polynomial tuple in $\mathbb{Q}[z_1, \dots, z_n]$  where each $f_i \in \mathbb{Z}[z_1,\dots,z_n]$.

Alternatively, one can consider $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear spaces of all the formal sums of edges in $G$ and of all the formal sums of vertices in $G$, and the $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear boundary map from the former to the latter, which takes each edge to the sum of its two boundary vertices. Menger's Theorem now states, that there exist $k$ sums of edges, no two of which have any common summands, such that all these $k$ sums are mapped by the boundary map to the sum of two vertices, if and only if after a deletion of any $k-1$ or less edges there still exists a sum of edges which is mapped by the boundary map to the sum of these two vertices.

We extend Menger's Edge Theorem to the sums of edges which are mapped by the boundary map to the sum of four vertices $A,B,C,D$. We prove that in an undirected graph $G$, in which all the vertices different from $A,B,C,D$ have even degrees, the following two statements are equivalent: There exist $k$ sums of edges, no two of which have any common summands, such that all these $k$ sums are mapped by the boundary map to $A+B+C+D$; After a deletion of any $k-1$ or less edges there still exists a sum of edges which is mapped by the boundary map to $A+B+C+D$.

Equivalently, for such a graph $G$, if after a deletion of any $k-1$ or less edges, four vertices $A,B,C,D$ can be split into two pairs of vertices, and the two vertices in each one of these pairs can be connected by a path so that these two paths are edge-disjoint, then four vertices $A,B,C,D$ can be split $k$ times into two pairs of vertices and the two vertices in each one of these $2k$ pairs connected by a path, in such a way that these $2k$ paths are pairwise edge-disjoint.","(459, 6)","In graph theory, the well-known Menger's Edge Theorem states that the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects any two non-adjacent vertices in a graph is equal to the maximum number of pairwise independent paths between these same vertices. In this paper, we present a generalization of this theorem for graphs with four distinct vertices. 

The extended theorem we propose provides a way to calculate the minimum number of edges needed to disconnect any two non-adjacent pairs of vertices in a graph that consists of four vertices. We proved our generalization using a series of lemmas and corollaries, building from well-established results in graph theory.

Our generalized Menger's Edge Theorem is particularly important when considering real-world networks, such as computer networks and social networks, which often exhibit a small number of vertices and edges. Indeed, our theorem is useful in these cases, as it provides insight into the structure of small graphs and networks while also being fairly simple and easy to use.

To demonstrate the applicability of our theorem, we provide examples of three different types of graphs with four vertices: complete graphs, cycle graphs, and non-isomorphic graphs. For each type of graph, we show how the generalized theorem holds, and we also use the theorem to determine the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects any two non-adjacent pairs of vertices in each graph.

Our work is a significant contribution to the field of graph theory, demonstrating that the classical Menger's Edge Theorem can indeed be generalized to graphs with four vertices, without the loss of any of the original theorem's insight and strength. We believe that our results have the potential to open up new directions for research in this important area of mathematics, and inspire new methods for understanding the properties of networks in real-world applications.","(330, 10)","Menger's Theorem asserts that in an undirected graph $G$ there exist $k$ pairwise edge-disjoint paths  between any two vertices $s$ and $t$ if and only if $G$ does not contain a set of $k+1$ vertices whose removal disconnects $s$ from $t$.

We carried out wide-field BVI CCD photometric observations of the GCs M3 and M13 using ","We carried out wide-field BVI CCD photometric observations of the GCs M3 and M13 using the BOAO 1.8 m telescope equipped with a 2K CCD. We present CMDs of M3 and M13. We have found AGB bumps at V = 14.85 for M3 at V = 14.25 for M13.

It is found that AGB stars in M3 are more concentrated near the bump, while those in M13 are scattered along the AGB sequence. We identified the RGB bump of M3 at V = 15.50 and that of M13 at V = 14.80. We have estimated the ratios R and R2 for M3 and M13 and found that of R for M3 is larger than that for M13 while R2's for M3 and M13 are similar when only normal HB stars are used in R and R2 for M13. However, we found that R's for M3 and M13 are similar while R2 for M3 is larger than that for M13 when all the HB stars are included in R and R2 for M13. We have compared the observed RGB LFs of M3 and M13 with the theoretical RGB LF of Bergbusch & VandenBerg at the same radial distances from the cluster centers as used in R and R2 for M3 and M13. We found ""extra stars"" belonging to M13 in the comparison of the observed RGB LF of M13 and the theoretical RGB LF of Bergbusch & VandenBerg. In the original definition of R of Buzzoni et al., N(HB) corresponds to the lifetime of HB stars in the RR Lyrae instability strip at log T_eff = 3.85. So, the smaller R value resulting for M13 compared with that for M3 in the case where only normal HB stars are included in R and R2 for M13 may be partially caused by ""extra stars"", and the similar R's for M3 and M13 in the case where the all HB stars are included in R and R2 for M13 may be caused by ""extra stars"" in the upper RGB of M13. If ""extra stars"" in the upper RGB of M13 are caused by an effective ""deep mixing"" these facts support the contention that an effective ""deep mixing"" could lead to different HB morphologies between M3 and M13 and subsequent sequences.","(412, 12)","This research paper aims to explore the different characteristics present in the bright branches of the Globular Clusters M3 and M13. 

Globular clusters are some of the oldest objects in the universe, and their study can provide insight into the early stages of star and galaxy formation. The M3 and M13 clusters are both located in the Milky Way, making them excellent objects for study. Previous observations have shown that these clusters have distinct photometric properties.

To better understand these properties, we adopt a photometric approach in this study. We use data from deep CCD photometry of these clusters to construct color-magnitude diagrams. These diagrams are essential tools for studying stellar populations, as they provide a visualization of the distribution of stars in the cluster. 

We find that the bright branches of M3 and M13 have differing characteristics. Specifically, the bright branch of M13 is significantly broader than that of M3, indicating the presence of a larger range of stellar masses. We hypothesize that this could be due to differences in the initial composition of these clusters, or variations in their evolutionary history. 

We also investigate the possibility of age differences between the clusters. Using theoretical isochrones, we estimate the ages of the clusters and compare them. Our results suggest that M3 is older than M13 by about 2 billion years. This supports the idea that differences in evolution history could be contributing to the observed differences in bright branch characteristics.

Further, we investigate the potential implications of our results on our understanding of stellar evolution in globular clusters. We discuss possible explanations for the observed differences, ranging from variations in mass loss to the presence of blue stragglers. 

In conclusion, our study presents evidence for distinct differences in the bright branches of M3 and M13, and provides insight into their potential causes. It also highlights the importance of careful analysis of photometric data in understanding stellar populations in these ancient, intriguing objects.","(354, 18)","We carried out wide-field BVI CCD photometric observations of the GCs M3 and M13 using 0.8m and 1.0m telescopes to investigate the characteristics of their bright branches.

Our observations covered a large area around the clusters, allowing us to sample a significant number of stars in the RGB and AGB phases. We used the DAOPHOT package to perform point-spread function (PSF) photometry on the images, which enabled us to obtain accurate magnitudes and colors for the observed stars. The photometric data were then corrected for extinction using the Schlegel et al. (1998) dust maps and transformed to the standard Johnson-Cousins system.

The color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of M3 and M3 are presented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The CMDs show a clear RGB and AGB population in both clusters, but with distinct differences in their characteristics. The RGB of M3 is more extended and has a broader color distribution compared to M13. In contrast, the AGB population of M3 is less populous and has a narrower color distribution than that of M13.

We analyzed the CMDs using the Dartmouth stellar evolution models (Dotter et al., 2008) to derive the ages and metallicities of the RGB populations in both clusters. Our results indicate that M3 is older and more metal-poor than M13, consistent with previous studies. The AGB populations in both clusters were also analyzed using the same models, and our results suggest that the AGB stars in M3 are more evolved and have higher luminosities than those in M13.

For many decades, ultrahigh energy charged particles of unknown origin that can be observed from ","For many decades, ultrahigh energy charged particles of unknown origin that can be observed from the ground have been a puzzle for particle physicists and astrophysicists. As an attempt to discriminate among several possible production scenarios, astrophysicists try to test the statistical isotropy of the directions of arrival of these cosmic rays. At the highest energies, they are supposed to point toward their sources with good accuracy. However, the observations are so rare that testing the distribution of such samples of directional data on the sphere is nontrivial. In this paper, we choose a nonparametric framework that makes weak hypotheses on the alternative distributions and allows in turn to detect various and possibly unexpected forms of anisotropy. We explore two particular procedures. Both are derived from fitting the empirical distribution with wavelet expansions of densities.

We use the wavelet frame introduced by [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 38 (2006b) 574-594 (electronic)], the so-called needlets. The expansions are truncated at scale indices no larger than some ${J^{\star}}$, and the $L^p$ distances between those estimates and the null density are computed. One family of tests (called Multiple) is based on the idea of testing the distance from the null for each choice of $J=1,\ldots,{J^{\star}}$, whereas the so-called PlugIn approach is based on the single full ${J^{\star}}$ expansion, but with thresholded wavelet coefficients. We describe the practical implementation of these two procedures and compare them to other methods in the literature. As alternatives to isotropy, we consider both very simple toy models and more realistic nonisotropic models based on Physics-inspired simulations. The Monte Carlo study shows good performance of the Multiple test, even at moderate sample size, for a wide sample of alternative hypotheses and for different choices of the parameter ${J^{\star}}$. On the 69 most energetic events published by the Pierre Auger Collaboration, the needlet-based procedures suggest statistical evidence for anisotropy. Using several values for the parameters of the methods, our procedures yield $p$-values below 1%, but with uncontrolled multiplicity issues. The flexibility of this method and the possibility to modify it to take into account a large variety of extensions of the problem make it an interesting option for future investigation of the origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.","(447, 19)","The quest to understand the origin of high energy cosmic rays has been a long-standing challenge for astrophysicists. One of the key properties of cosmic rays is their isotropy, or the uniformity of their distribution in space. In this paper, we explore the use of spherical needlets as a tool for testing the isotropy of high energy cosmic rays.

Spherical needlets are mathematical functions that are particularly well-suited for analyzing data on the sphere, such as the distribution of cosmic rays. They provide a flexible and efficient means of decomposing a signal into different scales and orientations, while taking into account the curvature of the sphere.

Using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory, we apply the spherical needlet transform to the arrival directions of high energy cosmic rays. We find that the distribution of cosmic rays is consistent with isotropy on large scales, but deviates from isotropy on smaller scales. This deviation is characterized by a clustering of cosmic rays in a few localized regions, known as hotspot regions.

We perform a number of statistical tests to quantify the significance of these hotspot regions, including a comparison with randomized data and a calculation of the angular power spectrum. We find that the hotspot regions are highly significant and cannot be explained by statistical fluctuations or by known astrophysical sources.

These results have important implications for our understanding of the origin of high energy cosmic rays. The existence of hotspot regions suggests the presence of unknown sources or acceleration mechanisms that produce cosmic rays preferentially in certain directions. Furthermore, the scale-dependence of the isotropy violation provides valuable clues about the properties of these sources and the conditions in the interstellar medium.

Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of spherical needlets for analyzing cosmic ray data and sheds new light on one of the most intriguing puzzles in astrophysics.","(332, 14)","For many decades, ultrahigh energy charged particles of unknown origin that can be observed from 10^17 eV to 10^20 eV have been a subject of interest in the field of astroparticle physics.

Spherical needlets are a type of wavelet that can be used to analyze data on the surface of a sphere, such as the sky map of HECR arrival directions. By applying spherical needlets to the HECR data, we can decompose the data into different scales and directions, allowing us to identify any potential anisotropies.

Our analysis is based on a large dataset of HECR events collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory, which is one of the largest and most sensitive HECR detectors in the world. The dataset consists of over 100,000 events with energies above 10^18 eV, covering a wide range of declinations and right ascensions. We apply the spherical needlet analysis to this dataset, using a range of needlet scales and resolutions to capture different features of the data.

For integer $0\leq k \leq |D|$, we study the number $N_f(D,k,b)$ of $k$-subsets $S\subseteq D$ such that \begin{align*} \sum_{x\in S} f(x)=b.

\end{align*} In this paper, we establish several asymptotic formulas for $N_f(D,k, b)$, depending on the nature of the ring $R$ and $f$.

For $R=\mathbb{Z}_n$, let $p=p(n)$ be the smallest prime divisor of $n$, $|D|=n-c \geq C_dn p^{-\frac 1d }+c$ and $f(x)=a_dx^d +\cdots +a_0\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $(a_d, \dots, a_1, n)=1$. Then $$\left| N_f(D, k, b)-\frac{1}{n}{n-c \choose k}\right|\leq {\delta(n)(n-c)+(1-\delta(n))(C_dnp^{-\frac 1d}+c)+k-1\choose k},$$ partially answering an open question raised by Stanley \cite{St}, where $\delta(n)=\sum_{i\mid n, \mu(i)=-1}\frac 1 i$ and $C_d=e^{1.85d}$.

Furthermore, if $n$ is a prime power, then $\delta(n) =1/p$ and one can take $C_d=4.41$.

For $R=\mathbb{F}_q$ of characteristic $p$, let $f(x)\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ be a polynomial of degree $d$ not divisible by $p$ and $D\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$ with $|D|=q-c\geq (d-1)\sqrt{q}+c$. Then $$\left| N_f(D, k, b)-\frac{1}{q}{q-c \choose k}\right|\leq {\frac{q-c}{p}+\frac {p-1}{p}((d-1)q^{\frac 12}+c)+k-1 \choose k}.$$ If $f(x)=ax+b$, then this problem is precisely the well-known subset sum problem over a finite abelian group. Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and let $D\subseteq G$ with $|D|=|G|-c\geq c$. Then $$\left| N_x(D, k, b)-\frac{1}{|G|}{|G|-c \choose k}\right|\leq {c + (|G|-2c)\delta(e(G))+k-1 \choose k},$$ where $e(G)$ is the exponent of $G$ and $\delta(n)=\sum_{i\mid n, \mu(i)=-1}\frac 1 i$. In particular, we give a new short proof for the explicit counting formula for the case $D=G$.","(594, 12)","The problem of counting subset sums of a polynomial has been studied extensively due to its relevance in various fields of computer science and mathematics. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for efficiently counting these subset sums, which offers significant improvements over previously known methods.

Our algorithm utilizes the concept of generating functions to represent and manipulate the polynomial subset sums. By constructing a generating function for a polynomial, we can easily extract coefficients that correspond to the number of subset sums with a given total. We show that by carefully choosing the form of the generating function, we can reduce the problem of counting subset sums to that of computing a polynomial product, which can be done efficiently using standard algorithms.

To further improve the performance of our algorithm, we incorporate techniques from algorithmic number theory and algebraic geometry. Specifically, we make use of fast Fourier transforms and resultants to speed up polynomial multiplication and solve systems of polynomial equations. Additionally, we exploit the underlying algebraic structure of the polynomial ring to reduce the number of operations required.

We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on a wide range of synthetic and real-world instances and demonstrate that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our algorithm can count subset sums of polynomials with millions of terms in mere seconds, making it a valuable tool for applications such as cryptography, coding theory, and computational biology.

Finally, we discuss potential extensions of our algorithm, such as using it to compute other combinatorial quantities or incorporating it as a subroutine in larger algorithms. We conclude by highlighting the theoretical contributions of our work and its potential impact in various research areas.","(304, 12)","Let $D$ be a subset of a finite commutative ring $R$ with identity.

$\bullet$ Background : In Heart rate variability analysis, the rate-rate time series suffer often from ","$\bullet$ Background : In Heart rate variability analysis, the rate-rate time series suffer often from aperiodic non-stationarity, presence of ectopic beats etc. It would be hard to extract helpful information from the original signals.

10 $\bullet$ Problem : Trend removal methods are commonly practiced to reduce the influence of the low frequency and aperiodic non-stationary in RR data.

This can unfortunately affect the signal and make the analysis on detrended data less appropriate. $\bullet$ Objective : Investigate the detrending effect (linear \& nonlinear) in temporal / nonliear analysis of heart rate variability of long-term RR data (in normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, 15 congestive heart failure and ventricular premature arrhythmia conditions).

$\bullet$ Methods : Temporal method : standard measure SDNN; Nonlinear methods : multi-scale Fractal Dimension (FD), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) \& Sample Entropy (Sam-pEn) analysis. $\bullet$ Results : The linear detrending affects little the global characteristics of the RR data, either 20 in temporal analysis or in nonlinear complexity analysis. After linear detrending, the SDNNs are just slightly shifted and all distributions are well preserved. The cross-scale complexity remained almost the same as the ones for original RR data or correlated. Nonlinear detrending changed not only the SDNNs distribution, but also the order among different types of RR data. After this processing, the SDNN became indistinguishable be-25 tween SDNN for normal sinus rhythm and ventricular premature beats. Different RR data has different complexity signature. Nonlinear detrending made the all RR data to be similar , in terms of complexity. It is thus impossible to distinguish them. The FD showed that nonlinearly detrended RR data has a dimension close to 2, the exponent from DFA is close to zero and SampEn is larger than 1.5 -- these complexity values are very close to those for 30 random signal. $\bullet$ Conclusions : Pre-processing by linear detrending can be performed on RR data, which has little influence on the corresponding analysis. Nonlinear detrending could be harmful and it is not advisable to use this type of pre-processing.

Exceptions do exist, but only combined with other appropriate techniques to avoid complete change of the signal's intrinsic dynamics. 35 Keywords $\bullet$ heart rate variability $\bullet$ linear / nonlinear detrending $\bullet$ complexity analysis $\bullet$ mul-tiscale analysis $\bullet$ detrended fluctuation analysis $\bullet$ fractal dimension $\bullet$ sample entropy;","(452, 19)","Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is a widely-used tool to assess the autonomic nervous system. HRV provides useful information about the state of an individual's health and is widely utilized in clinical settings. One challenge in HRV analysis is how to remove nonlinear trends from the data.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of nonlinear trend removal techniques in HRV analysis. Nonlinear trends can arise from a variety of sources, including respiration, motion artifacts, and nonlinear temporal dependencies. These trends can significantly impact HRV analysis results, leading to incorrect interpretation and diagnosis.

We evaluated several nonlinear trend removal techniques, including empirical mode decomposition (EMD), ensemble EMD (EEMD), stationary subspace analysis (SSA), and wavelet decomposition. Through simulations, we found that EEMD and SSA outperformed EMD and wavelet decomposition in nonlinear trend removal.

We also applied these techniques to clinical data and demonstrated their effectiveness in removing nonlinear trends. However, we caution that even the best-performing nonlinear trend removal techniques may still result in some residual nonlinear trends. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of trend removal techniques and interpret HRV results in light of any remaining nonlinear trends.

In conclusion, nonlinear trend removal is an important step in HRV analysis, but it must be performed with care. We recommend using EEMD or SSA techniques for nonlinear trend removal in HRV analysis, but careful evaluation of the results is necessary to ensure accurate interpretation.

The application of these codes is widespread in cryptography, storage, and reliable communication systems. The contribution of this study is principally based on the methods used to determine the bounds and tables of the corresponding parameters. The study has been conducted using an exhaustive computational search that considers the generator matrices of the codes and applies several strategies such as combinatorial bounds and coding-theoretic criteria to prune the search. 

One of the most significant findings of this research is the discovery of several previously unknown codes that have better parameters than previously published ones. In addition, bounds for different combinations of parameters have been computed. The research has also identified the existence of codes with optimal parameters that were previously conjectured, but whose existence was not previously established. The descriptions of the identified codes include their generator matrices, weight distributions, and dimensions.

Moreover, graphics of the distance distribution have also been produced for each family of identified codes. The graphical depictions provide significant insights into the structures of the codes and their weight distributions, which entail crucial information on their possible applications. The graph counterparts of the codes also enable better visual comprehension of their properties, especially in relation to the probabilities of detecting or correcting errors, as well as their overall reliability.

In this work we provide algorithmic solutions to five fundamental problems concerning the verification, synthesis ","In this work we provide algorithmic solutions to five fundamental problems concerning the verification, synthesis and correction of concurrent systems that can be modeled by bounded p/t-nets. We express concurrency via partial orders and assume that behavioral specifications are given via monadic second order logic. A c-partial-order is a partial order whose Hasse diagram can be covered by c paths. For a finite set T of transitions, we let P(c,T,\phi) denote the set of all T-labelled c-partial-orders satisfying \phi. If N=(P,T) is a p/t-net we let P(N,c) denote the set of all c-partially-ordered runs of N.

A (b, r)-bounded p/t-net is a b-bounded p/t-net in which each place appears repeated at most r times. We solve the following problems: 1. Verification: given an MSO formula \phi and a bounded p/t-net N determine whether P(N,c)\subseteq P(c,T,\phi), whether P(c,T,\phi)\subseteq P(N,c), or whether P(N,c)\cap P(c,T,\phi)=\emptyset.

2. Synthesis from MSO Specifications: given an MSO formula \phi, synthesize a semantically minimal (b,r)-bounded p/t-net N satisfying P(c,T,\phi)\subseteq P(N, c).

3. Semantically Safest Subsystem: given an MSO formula \phi defining a set of safe partial orders, and a b-bounded p/t-net N, possibly containing unsafe behaviors, synthesize the safest (b,r)-bounded p/t-net N' whose behavior lies in between P(N,c)\cap P(c,T,\phi) and P(N,c).

4. Behavioral Repair: given two MSO formulas \phi and \psi, and a b-bounded p/t-net N, synthesize a semantically minimal (b,r)-bounded p/t net N' whose behavior lies in between P(N,c) \cap P(c,T,\phi) and P(c,T,\psi).

5. Synthesis from Contracts: given an MSO formula \phi^yes specifying a set of good behaviors and an MSO formula \phi^no specifying a set of bad behaviors, synthesize a semantically minimal (b,r)-bounded p/t-net N such that P(c,T,\phi^yes) \subseteq P(N,c) but P(c,T,\phi^no ) \cap P(N,c)=\emptyset.","(467, 15)","In recent years, the need for automated verification, synthesis and correction of concurrent systems has grown significantly. The complexity and size of such systems have made manual methods impractical and error-prone. To tackle this, researchers have developed various automated techniques, of which MSO Logic has emerged as a promising tool. 

MSO Logic is a logical framework that supports the formal specification and verification of concurrent systems. It enables reasoning about properties of systems that involve complex interactions among multiple components and can handle systems with a large number of states.

This paper presents a novel approach for automated verification, synthesis and correction of concurrent systems based on MSO Logic. The approach combines various techniques, including model checking, synthesis, and correction, to verify and correct properties of concurrent systems. It also enables the synthesis of correct-by-construction concurrent systems, which satisfy specified requirements and constraints.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we evaluated it on a variety of case studies, including a mutual exclusion protocol, a leader-election algorithm, and a distributed algorithm for state machine replication. The results demonstrate that the approach is effective in detecting and correcting errors in concurrent systems, improving their performance, and ensuring their correct behavior.

Our approach also has several advantages over existing methods. It is modular, scalable, and can handle large systems with millions of states. It can also handle systems with complex synchronization constraints and can synthesize optimized implementations that meet specified requirements.

In summary, this paper presents a novel approach for automated verification, synthesis and correction of concurrent systems based on MSO Logic. The approach is effective in verifying and correcting properties of concurrent systems, improving their performance, and ensuring their correct behavior.

Given a concurrent system and a safety property expressed in MSO logic, we develop an algorithm to determine whether the system satisfies the property. Our approach is based on a novel translation of MSO formulas into finite automata, which enables the use of existing model checking techniques to verify the safety property.

Our approach involves translating the MSO formula expressing the safety property into a finite automaton, and then using this automaton to guide the synthesis of the controller.

We present an algorithm to optimize the performance of a concurrent system by minimizing the number of transitions between different states. Our approach involves expressing the optimization problem as an MSO formula, and then using existing optimization techniques to minimize the number of transitions.

Schnyder woods are decompositions of simple triangulations into three edge-disjoint spanning trees crossing each other ","Schnyder woods are decompositions of simple triangulations into three edge-disjoint spanning trees crossing each other in a specific way. In this article, we define a generalization of Schnyder woods to $d$-angulations (plane graphs with faces of degree $d$) for all $d\geq 3$. A \emph{Schnyder decomposition} is a set of $d$ spanning forests crossing each other in a specific way, and such that each internal edge is part of exactly $d-2$ of the spanning forests. We show that a Schnyder decomposition exists if and only if the girth of the $d$-angulation is $d$. As in the case of Schnyder woods ($d=3$), there are alternative formulations in terms of orientations (""fractional"" orientations when $d\geq 5$) and in terms of corner-labellings.

Moreover, the set of Schnyder decompositions on a fixed $d$-angulation of girth $d$ is a distributive lattice. We also show that the structures dual to Schnyder decompositions (on $d$-regular plane graphs of mincut $d$ rooted at a vertex $v^*$) are decompositions into $d$ spanning trees rooted at $v^*$ such that each edge not incident to $v^*$ is used in opposite directions by two trees. Additionally, for even values of $d$, we show that a subclass of Schnyder decompositions, which are called even, enjoy additional properties that yield a reduced formulation; in the case d=4, these correspond to well-studied structures on simple quadrangulations (2-orientations and partitions into 2 spanning trees). In the case d=4, the dual of even Schnyder decompositions yields (planar) orthogonal and straight-line drawing algorithms.

For a 4-regular plane graph $G$ of mincut 4 with $n$ vertices plus a marked vertex $v$, the vertices of $G\backslash v$ are placed on a $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ grid according to a permutation pattern, and in the orthogonal drawing each of the $2n-2$ edges of $G\backslash v$ has exactly one bend. Embedding also the marked vertex $v$ is doable at the cost of two additional rows and columns and 8 additional bends for the 4 edges incident to $v$. We propose a further compaction step for the drawing algorithm and show that the obtained grid-size is strongly concentrated around $25n/32\times 25n/32$ for a uniformly random instance with $n$ vertices.","(465, 12)","Schnyder decompositions have been utilized in a variety of applications in graph theory. This paper focuses on their application to the drawing of regular plane graphs. A regular plane graph is a special type of planar graph with the additional property that all its faces have the same number of edges, which is known as the face-degree of the graph. 

We provide a new and efficient algorithm for computing Schnyder decompositions for regular plane graphs. Our algorithm has two phases. The first phase constructs a spanning tree of the input graph. The second phase computes a Schnyder decomposition of the graph with respect to this spanning tree.

We show that the Schnyder decomposition of a regular plane graph can be used to obtain a straight-line drawing of the graph with good properties. Specifically, we prove that the drawing produced has at most six bends per edge and that all edges intersect at right angles. Additionally, we show that if the input regular plane graph has face-degree at most five, then the drawing produced has a linear number of bends.

To demonstrate the utility of our algorithm, we present two applications of Schnyder decompositions in drawing regular plane graphs. The first application is to the problem of constructing straight-line embeddings of regular grids into regular plane graphs. We show that our algorithm can be used to obtain a drawing of a regular grid with good properties, such as evenly spaced coordinates and bounded vertex degree.

The second application of Schnyder decompositions is to the problem of drawing graphs with circular arc edges. We show that a Schnyder decomposition of a regular plane graph with face-degree at most four can be used to obtain a straight-line drawing of a graph with circular arc edges. This drawing has the desirable property of minimizing the total curvature of the edges.

In conclusion, our algorithm for computing Schnyder decompositions of regular plane graphs has a range of useful applications in drawing and embedding regular plane graphs. Our results demonstrate that such decompositions can be used to obtain drawings with desirable properties, such as straight-line edges with few bends and edges with circular arcs.","(384, 18)","Schnyder woods are decompositions of simple triangulations into three edge-disjoint spanning trees crossing each other 180 degrees.

We explore how to improve the hybrid model description of the particles originating from the ","We explore how to improve the hybrid model description of the particles originating from the wake that a jet produced in a heavy ion collision leaves in the droplet of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through which it propagates, using linearized hydrodynamics on a background Bjorken flow. Jet energy and momentum loss described by the hybrid model become currents sourcing linearized hydrodynamics. By solving the linearized hydrodynamic equations numerically, we investigate the development of the wake in the dynamically evolving droplet of QGP, study the effect of viscosity, scrutinize energy-momentum conservation, and check the validity of the linear approximation. We find that linearized hydrodynamics works better in the viscous case because diffusive modes damp the energy-momentum perturbation produced by the jet. We calculate the distribution of particles produced from the jet wake by using the Cooper-Frye prescription and find that both the transverse momentum spectrum and the distribution of particles in azimuthal angle are similar in shape in linearized hydrodynamics and in the hybrid model. Their normalizations are different because the momentum-rapidity distribution in the linearized hydrodynamics analysis is more spread out, due to sound modes. Since the Bjorken flow has no transverse expansion, we explore the effect of transverse flow by using local boosts to add it into the Cooper-Frye formula. After including the effects of transverse flow in this way, the transverse momentum spectrum becomes harder: more particles with transverse momenta bigger than $2$ GeV are produced than in the hybrid model. Although we defer implementing this analysis in a jet Monte Carlo, as would be needed to make quantitative comparisons to data, we gain a qualitative sense of how the jet wake may modify jet observables by computing proxies for two example observables: the lost energy recovered in a cone of varying open angle, and the fragmentation function. We find that linearized hydrodynamics with transverse flow effects added improves the description of the jet wake in the hybrid model in just the way that comparison to data indicates is needed. Our study illuminates a path to improving the description of the wake in the hybrid model, highlighting the need to take into account the effects of both transverse flow and the broadening of the energy-momentum perturbation in spacetime rapidity on particle production.","(402, 11)","The study of fluid dynamics plays a key role in understanding the behavior of fluid flows in various applications. One area of interest in fluid dynamics is the study of jet wakes, which arises when a fluid jet makes contact with a stationary fluid. In this paper, we investigate the jet wake problem using linearized hydrodynamics.

We consider a two-dimensional jet flow, where the jet fluid travels at a constant velocity and makes contact with a quiescent fluid. The fluid flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, which are linearized around the steady-state solution. We derive expressions for the stream-function and velocity potential, which satisfy the boundary conditions at the free surface and at the solid wall. These expressions are then used to calculate the pressure and velocity fields in both the jet and wake regions.

The results of our study show that the strength of the jet wake depends on various parameters, such as the jet velocity, the distance from the jet source to the free surface, and the surface tension of the fluid. We find that the wake forms a characteristic asymmetric pattern, with a region of low pressure and high velocity immediately behind the jet, followed by a region of high pressure and low velocity further downstream.

We also investigate the stability of the jet wake using linear stability analysis. We find that the wake is unstable to symmetric disturbances, which can lead to the formation of vortices in the wake. We quantify the growth rate of these disturbances, and find that they increase with increasing jet velocity and decreasing distance from the jet source to the free surface.

Overall, our study provides new insights into the dynamics of jet wakes in linearized hydrodynamics, and highlights the importance of considering the effects of fluid viscosity and surface tension in understanding fluid flows. Our results have potential applications in various engineering fields, such as fuel injection systems and mixing processes.","(351, 14)","We explore how to improve the hybrid model description of the particles originating from the 3D jet wake using linearized hydrodynamics in this paper. The jet wake is a complex phenomenon that arises from the interaction between a high-speed jet and the surrounding fluid. It plays a crucial role in various engineering applications, such as gas turbines and rocket propulsion systems. However, accurately predicting the behavior of the jet wake remains a significant challenge due to its highly nonlinear and turbulent nature.

To address this challenge, we employ a hybrid model that combines the advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions. The Eulerian description is used to capture the large-scale features of the jet wake, while the Lagrangian description is employed to simulate the behavior of individual particles originating from the jet. However, the current implementation of the hybrid model relies on a simplified treatment of the particle dynamics, which may not accurately capture the complex interactions between the particles and the surrounding fluid.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to describe the particle dynamics within the hybrid model by incorporating linearized hydrodynamic equations. These equations provide a more accurate representation of the particle motion by taking into account the effects of the surrounding fluid on the particles. We derive a set of linearized Navier-Stokes equations that describe the evolution of the particle velocity and position over time. These equations are then coupled with the Eulerian description of the jet wake to form a complete hybrid model.

Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model in capturing the complex behavior of the particle-laden jet wake. Our results show that the new approach significantly improves the accuracy of the particle dynamics compared to the simplified treatment used in the current hybrid model. We also investigate the sensitivity of the results to various parameters, such as the particle size and density, and the jet velocity. Our findings suggest that the proposed hybrid model is robust and can be applied to a wide range of engineering applications.

The implications of our work are significant, as they have the potential to improve the design and performance of various engineering systems that rely on the jet wake phenomenon.

We characterized the transiting planetary system orbiting the G2V star K2-38 using the new-generation echelle ","We characterized the transiting planetary system orbiting the G2V star K2-38 using the new-generation echelle spectrograph ESPRESSO. We carried out a photometric analysis of the available K2 photometric light curve of this star to measure the radius of its two known planets. Using 43 ESPRESSO high-precision radial velocity measurements taken over the course of 8 months along with the 14 previously published HIRES RV measurements, we modeled the orbits of the two planets through a MCMC analysis, significantly improving their mass measurements. Using ESPRESSO spectra, we derived the stellar parameters, $T_{\rm eff}$=5731$\pm$66, $\log g$=4.38$\pm$0.11~dex, and $[Fe/H]$=0.26$\pm$0.05~dex, and thus the mass and radius of K2-38, $M_{\star}$=1.03 $^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$~M$_{\oplus}$ and $R_{\star}$=1.06 $^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$~R$_{\oplus}$. We determine new values for the planetary properties of both planets. We characterize K2-38b as a super-Earth with $R_{\rm P}$=1.54$\pm$0.14~R$_{\rm \oplus}$ and $M_{\rm p}$=7.3$^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$~M$_{\oplus}$, and K2-38c as a sub-Neptune with $R_{\rm P}$=2.29$\pm$0.26~R$_{\rm \oplus}$ and $M_{\rm p}$=8.3$^{+1.3}_{-1.3}$~M$_{\oplus}$. We derived a mean density of $\rho_{\rm p}$=11.0$^{+4.1}_{-2.8}$~g cm$^{-3}$ for K2-38b and $\rho_{\rm p}$=3.8$^{+1.8}_{-1.1}$~g~cm$^{-3}$ for K2-38c, confirming K2-38b as one of the densest planets known to date. The best description for the composition of K2-38b comes from an iron-rich Mercury-like model, while K2-38c is better described by a rocky model with a H2 envelope. The maximum collision stripping boundary shows how giant impacts could be the cause for the high density of K2-38b. The irradiation received by each planet places them on opposite sides of the radius valley. We find evidence of a long-period signal in the radial velocity time-series whose origin could be linked to a 0.25-3~M$_{\rm J}$ planet or stellar activity.","(480, 11)","The K2-38 planetary system has long been an object of fascination for astronomers. This system is home to one of the densest planets discovered to date. A team of researchers has embarked on a mission to unravel the mysteries of this intriguing system.

The team utilized the high-precision radial velocity technique to analyze data from the K2 mission and gather new insights into this phenomenal system. They measured the planet's mass and radius and used these measurements to calculate the planet's density, which is exceptionally high. The K2-38b, as the planet is known, has a density that is comparable to that of iron.

In addition to the planet's density, the team analyzed the star's spectral properties, which allowed them to estimate the planet's atmospheric composition and temperature. They found that the atmosphere is likely to be dominated by heavy elements, based on the high density of the planet.

The researchers also investigated the planet's orbit, which is circular and close to the star. This orbit ensures that the planet is likely to be tidally locked, with one side constantly facing the star. The team used simulations to understand the impact of this tidal locking on planetary atmosphere and climate.

By conducting a detailed analysis of the K2-38 planetary system, the research team has provided valuable new insights into one of the densest planets known to date.

We analyzed a total of 24 nights of ESPRESSO data, covering a time span of 10 months, to derive the orbital periods, eccentricities, and masses of the planets in the system.

Our analysis revealed that K2-38 is a multiple planetary system consisting of at least three planets: a super-Earth (K2-38b) with a mass of 8.4 M⊕ and a radius of 1.3 R⊕, an Earth-sized planet (K2-038c) with a mass similar to that of our own planet, and a Neptune-sized planet (k2-38d) with a mass comparable to that of Uranus. The innermost planet, K2-038b, exhibits a highly eccentric orbit with an eccentricity of 0.25, which leads to extreme variations in its distance from the host star, resulting in a surface temperature that fluctuates between 1000 K and 2000 K.

On the basis of general relativity and quantum statistics, it was shown (Neslu\v{s}an L.: 2009, ","On the basis of general relativity and quantum statistics, it was shown (Neslu\v{s}an L.: 2009, Phys. Rev. D 80, 024015, arxiv:0808.3484) that the equation of state (ES) of extremely hot Fermi-Dirac gas in the surface layer of an ultra-relativistic compact object converges to the same form as the relativistic equation of thermodynamical equilibrium (RETE), which is the condition of stability of the object. The description of energy state of a gas particle was completed with the term corresponding with the potential-type energy. The necessity of such the term is set by the demand of convergence of the relativistic particle-impulse distribution law to its Maxwell-Boltzmann form in the classical limit.

The identity of the ES and RETE, both applied to the gas in the object's surface layer, becomes perfect, yielding the stable object, when the object's physical radius is identical to its gravitational radius. In this state, the internal energy of gas particles in a volume of the object's surface layer increases over all limits in the frame of the volume and this opens the question if the horizon of events actually is an insuperable barrier. It seems to be possible that some matter can be temporarily lifted above the surface or, so far, be ejected from the object and can emit a radiation detectable by a distant observer.

In our contribution, we demonstrate a general validity of the functional form of the potential-type energy found in our previous work. The consistency of the RETE with its non-relativistic approximation can occur only for this functional form. We also point out some observational consequences of the approximate identity of ES and RETE before the object collapses, in the proper time, to its gravitational radius as well as the possible observational consequences of the infinitely high internal energy in the surface layer of already collapsed object. In general, we propagate the idea that a lot of phenomena observed at the stellar-sized or supermassive black holes (or not-yet black holes) can be not necessarily related to the structures in a vicinity of the black hole, e.g.

to an accretion disk, but they can be linked directly to the behaviour of the central, ultra-compact object.","(408, 13)","The study of black holes has long been a cornerstone in astrophysical research, but non-black black holes have only recently come under scrutiny. These non-black black holes, also known as gravastars or Bose stars, are alternative solutions to the equations of general relativity that describe non-rotating black holes. 

While black holes are characterized by a point of singularity at their centers, gravastars or Bose stars are made up of a Bose-Einstein condensate of particles that effectively form a surface between their event horizon and their center. This surface is known as the gravastar surface, which creates a repulsive force that prevents matter from collapsing into a singularity. 

Recent research has shown that gravastars are a viable alternative to black holes, and their existence has significant implications for our understanding of the universe. They can help explain observations such as the apparent absence of intermediate-sized black holes and the existence of ultraluminous X-ray sources. Moreover, they provide a unique opportunity to test hypotheses related to the quantum nature of gravity.

In this paper, we explore the fundamentals of non-black black holes and provide an in-depth analysis of gravastars. Our approach involves a combination of analytical and numerical methods to study the structure and properties of these objects. We derive the equations of state that describe gravastars and show that they are stable under certain conditions. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics of accretion disks around these objects and the behavior of test particles in their vicinity.

Our findings indicate that gravastars are a promising avenue for future research, which could shed light on some of the most compelling questions in modern astrophysics. Their unique properties make them a fascinating and challenging object of study, both for theorists and observers alike.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental properties of NBHs, including their thermodynamic behavior, stability, and observational signatures.

We begin by reviewing the theoretical framework for NBHs, which is based on the idea that the event horizon of a black hole is not a one-way membrane, but rather a two-way membrane that allows for the exchange of matter and energy between the interior and exterior of the black hole. This leads to a modification of the standard black hole thermodynamics, where the Hawking temperature and entropy are no longer zero. We derive the expressions for the temperature and entropy of NBHs in terms of the mass and angular momentum of the black hole, and show that they exhibit a non-trivial dependence on these parameters.

Next, we investigate the stability of NBHs against small perturbations. We find that NBHs are stable against radial perturbations, but unstable against axial perturbations. This instability leads to the emission of gravitational waves, which can be used to test the existence of NBHs. We also discuss the possibility of observing NBHs through their effects on the surrounding environment, such as the emission of Hawking radiation and the bending of light around the black hole.

We report the discovery of two exoplanets transiting high-jitter stars. HAT-P-32b orbits the bright V=11.289 ","We report the discovery of two exoplanets transiting high-jitter stars.

HAT-P-32b orbits the bright V=11.289 star GSC 3281-00800, with a period P = 2.150008 d. The stellar and planetary masses and radii depend on the eccentricity of the system, which is poorly constrained due to the high velocity jitter (~80m/s). Assuming a circular orbit, the star has a mass of 1.16+-0.04 M_sun, and radius of 1.22+-0.02 R_sun, while the planet has a mass of 0.860+-0.164 MJ, and a radius of 1.789+-0.025 RJ. When the eccentricity is allowed to vary, the best-fit model results in a planet which is close to filling its Roche Lobe. Including the constraint that the planet cannot exceed its Roche Lobe results in the following best-fit parameters: e = 0.163+-0.061, Mp = 0.94+-0.17 MJ, Rp = 2.04+-0.10 RJ, Ms = 1.18+0.04-0.07 M_sun and Rs = 1.39+-0.07 R_sun. The second planet, HAT-P-33b, orbits the bright V=11.188 star GSC 2461-00988, with a period P = 3.474474 d. As for HAT-P-32, the stellar and planetary masses and radii of HAT-P-33 depend on the eccentricity, which is poorly constrained due to the high jitter (~50m/s). In this case spectral line bisector spans are significantly anti-correlated with the radial velocity residuals, and we use this correlation to reduce the residual rms to ~35m/s. We find the star has a mass of either 1.38+-0.04 M_sun or 1.40+-0.10 M_sun, and a radius of either 1.64+-0.03 R_sun or 1.78+-0.28 R_sun, while the planet has a mass of either 0.762+-0.101 MJ or 0.763+-0.117 MJ, and a radius of either 1.686+-0.045 RJ or 1.827+-0.290 RJ, for an assumed circular orbit or for the best-fit eccentric orbit respectively. Due to the large bisector span variations exhibited by both stars we rely on detailed modeling of the photometric light curves to rule out blend scenarios. Both planets are among the largest radii transiting planets discovered to date.","(345, 10)","This study investigates the properties of two highly inflated hot Jupiters, HAT-P-32b and HAT-P-33b, in addition to characterizing their high-jitter host stars. By analyzing transit observations from the Kepler spacecraft, we derive various parameters for the planets and their parent stars. Our findings reveal that both HAT-P-32b and HAT-P-33b have radii larger than expected for planets of their masses and incident fluxes, indicating that they have retained a significant fraction of the energy deposited during their formation. Additionally, we find that their host stars exhibit high levels of activity, with irregular photometric and spectroscopic variability that causes significant transit-timing variations. We further model the observed transit-timing variations of HAT-P-32b and HAT-P-33b using a combination of star-spot crossings and gravitational perturbations from known planetary companions.

To better understand the physical properties of these highly inflated hot Jupiters, we perform a detailed analysis of the transit light curves of HAT-P-32b and HAT-P-33b. Our results suggest that the inflated radii of these planets can be explained by the deposition of additional energy into their atmospheres, either through tidal heating or from a short-lived accretion process. We also find possible evidence of a day-to-night temperature gradient in the atmosphere of HAT-P-33b, which could be driven by strong winds at the planet's equator.

In addition to characterizing the planets themselves, we also investigate the properties of their host stars. We find that both stars exhibit signs of rotationally modulated activity, including starspots and plage regions, which drive periodic photometric and spectroscopic variations. The high levels of activity exhibited by these stars suggest that they are relatively young, with ages on the order of a few hundred million years.

Overall, our study provides important insights into the physical properties of highly inflated hot Jupiters and their parent stars. Our results suggest that these planets have experienced significant energy deposition during their formation, which has led to their anomalously large radii. Additionally, the high level of activity exhibited by their host stars indicates that they are important targets for future studies aimed at characterizing the complex interplay between planet formation and stellar activity.","(377, 14)","We report the discovery of two exoplanets transiting high-jitter stars.

Both planets are classified as highly inflated hot Jupiters, with radii significantly larger than those predicted by theoretical models. This inflation is likely due to the intense stellar irradiation these planets receive, causing their atmospheres to expand and heat up.

Using a combination of transit photometry and radial velocity measurements, we were able to determine the orbital periods, masses, and radii of both planets with high precision.

Aims : The hydrogen-deficient supergiants known as R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars might be the ","Aims : The hydrogen-deficient supergiants known as R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars might be the result of a double-degenerate merger of two white dwarfs (WDs), or a final helium shell flash in a planetary nebula central star. In this context, any information on the geometry of their circumstellar environment and, in particular, the potential detection of elongated structures, is of great importance. Methods : We obtained near-IR observations of V854 Cen with the AMBER recombiner located at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) array with the compact array (B$\leq$35m) in 2013 and the long array (B$\leq$140m) in 2014. At each time, V854 Cen was at maximum light.

The $H$- and $K$-band continua were investigated by means of spectrally dependant geometric models. These data were supplemented with mid-IR VISIR/VLT images. Results : A dusty slightly elongated over density is discovered both in the $H$- and $K$-band images. With the compact array, the central star is unresolved ($\Theta\leq2.5$\,mas), but a flattened dusty environment of $8 \times 11$ mas is discovered whose flux increases from about $\sim$20% in the $H$ band to reach about $\sim$50% at 2.3$\micron$, which indicates hot (T$\sim$1500\,K) dust in the close vicinity of the star. The major axis is oriented at a position angle (P.A.) of 126$\pm$29$\deg$. Adding the long-array configuration dataset provides tighter constraints on the star diameter ($\Theta\leq1.0$ mas), a slight increase of the overdensity to $12 \times 15$ mas and a consistent P.A. of 133$\pm$49$\deg$. The closure phases, sensitive to asymmetries, are null and compatible with a centro-symmetric, unperturbed environment excluding point sources at the level of 3% of the total flux in 2013 and 2014. The VISIR images exhibit a flattened aspect ratio at the 15-20% level at larger distances ($\sim$1$\arcsec$) with a position angle of 92$\pm$19$\deg$, marginally consistent with the interferometric observations.

Conclusions : This is the first time that a moderately elongated structure has been observed around an RCB star. These observations confirm the numerous suggestions for a bipolar structure proposed for this star in the literature, which were mainly based on polarimetric and spectroscopic observations.","(473, 16)","The RCB star V854 Cen is a rare type of star exhibiting irregular declines in brightness by large factors, and its peculiar nature makes it an important object for understanding stellar evolution. In this study, we present new observations of V854 Cen with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at submillimeter wavelengths, which reveal the presence of a hot and dusty shell around the star. The shell is detected in thermal dust continuum emission and is found to extend out to a distance of ~1000 AU from the star. The estimated mass of the shell is ~0.002 solar masses and the temperature is estimated to be ~1500 K.

The origin of the shell remains unclear, but it is likely the result of a recent episode of mass loss from the star. The estimated mass-loss rate is found to be ~10^-7 solar masses per year, which is somewhat higher than what is seen in typical RCB stars. The high mass-loss rate and the presence of the hot and dusty shell suggest that some unusual physical processes may have occurred in the star's recent past.

Our observations also provide new information on the chemistry of the shell. We detect a number of molecular species in the emission, including CO, SiO, HCN, SO, and CS. The abundances of these species are generally low, which suggests that the shell is chemically evolved and may have undergone a period of significant chemical processing.

Overall, the ALMA observations of V854 Cen provide new insights into the nature of this fascinating object and its unusual properties. The presence of the hot and dusty shell, along with the high mass-loss rate and unusual chemistry, makes V854 Cen an important object for understanding the late stages of stellar evolution, and for probing the physical processes that occur during the formation of planetary nebulae and supernova remnants.","(336, 11)","Aims : The hydrogen-deficient supergiants known as R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars might be the 1.4-8 solar mass progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. Understanding the circumstellar environment of these enigmatic objects is crucial for shedding light on their evolution and explosion mechanisms. Here, we investigate the properties of the hot dusty shell surrounding V854 Cen, a well-studied RCB star located in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Methodology : We employed a combination of spectroscopic and photometric observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to study the hot dusty shell around V854 Cen. Our dataset includes ALMA band 6 and 7 observations, HST WFC3 and ACS imaging, and VLT FORS2 spectroscopy. We analyzed the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the shell using radiative transfer models to constrain its physical parameters.

Findings : Our analysis reveals a hot dusty shell with a temperature of approximately 1000 K and a radius of about 10^16 cm. The shell's optical depth is estimated to be around 10^(-3), indicating a relatively transparent medium. We detect a significant amount of dust in the shell, with a mass of approximately 10^(-5) solar masses. The SED of the shell is well-reproduced by our radiative transfer models, which suggest that the shell is composed of amorphous carbon grains with a size distribution peaking at around 0.1 microns.

Implications : The presence of a hot dusty shell around an RCB star like V854 Cen has significant implications for our understanding of these objects. The shell's properties suggest that it is a result of mass loss during the star's asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, which is consistent with theoretical models of RCB star evolution. However, the shell's temperature and dust composition are not well-explained by standard AGB models, indicating that additional processes may be at play. Our results also suggest that the shell may be responsible for the observed variability in V854 Cen's light curve, which could be related to changes in the shell's geometry or dust composition.

We test the effect of assumptions about stellar motion on the behavior of gravitational instabilities ","We test the effect of assumptions about stellar motion on the behavior of gravitational instabilities in protoplanetary disks around solar-type stars by performing two simulations that are identical in all respects except the treatment of the star. In one simulation, the star is assumed to remain fixed at the center of the inertial reference frame. In the other, stellar motion is handled properly by including an indirect potential in the hydrodynamic equations to model the star's reference frame as one which is accelerated by star/disk interactions. The disks in both simulations orbit a solar mass star, initially extend from 2.3 to 40 AU with a r^-1/2 surface density profile, and have a total mass of 0.14 M_sun. The gamma = 5/3 ideal gas is assumed to cool everywhere with a constant cooling time of two outer rotation periods.

The overall behavior of the disk evolution is similar, except for weakening in various measures of GI activity by about at most tens of percent for the indirect potential case. Overall conclusions about disk evolution in earlier papers by our group, where the star was always assumed to be fixed in an inertial frame, remain valid. There is no evidence for independent one-armed instabilities, like SLING, in either simulation. On the other hand, the stellar motion about the system center of mass (COM) in the simulation with the indirect potential is substantial, up to 0.25 AU during the burst phase, as GIs initiate, and averaging about 0.9 AU during the asymptotic phase, when the GIs reach an overall balance of heating and cooling. These motions appear to be a stellar response to nonlinear interactions between discrete global spiral modes in both the burst and asymptotic phases of the evolution, and the star's orbital motion about the COM reflects the orbit periods of disk material near the corotation radii of the dominant spiral waves. This motion is, in principle, large enough to be observable and could be confused with stellar wobble due to the presence of one or more super-Jupiter mass protoplanets orbiting at 10's AU. We discuss why the excursions in our simulation are so much larger than those seen in simulations by Rice et al. 2003a.","(400, 13)","The fate of a young planetary system greatly depends on protoplanetary disks, where its constituent matter cools, collapses and ultimately accretes onto the central star. Though a consensus has emerged that gravitational instabilities play an important role in the evolution of these disks, their exact impact on the motion of stellar bodies remains an active area of research.

This review presents the latest findings on the dynamic role of gravitational instabilities in inducing stellar motion in protoplanetary disks. Gravitational instabilities are caused by local over-densities within the disk, which regions experience high pressure and temperature. These regions may coalesce over time and form clumps that grow and migrate towards the central star, dragging with them nearby planetesimals through tidal interactions. We now know that these clumps can also produce spiral arms, which provide much of the angular momentum necessary to induce stellar motion.

A variety of numerical models have been developed in recent years to simulate the formation and evolution of disks with gravitational instabilities. These models have largely confirmed that the motion of clumps and spiral arms is accompanied by significant momentum transfer, leading to substantial stellar motion over time scales of millions of years. Disks that experience strong gravitational instability can potentially eject up to 10% of the mass of their disk in clumps, with the central star experiencing motion on the order of meters per second.

A remaining challenge in the field is to understand the impact of stellar motion on disk evolution and planet formation. Stellar motion can greatly affect the total angular momentum of the system, potentially ejecting planets delivered by migrating clumps or halting the growth of planetesimals at wide orbits. We conclude by discussing several possible avenues for future research in this area, including numerical simulations with unprecedented resolution and observational follow-up surveys of protoplanetary disks with high radial velocity accuracy.

In summary, gravitational instabilities in protoplanetary disks are now acknowledged to play a vital role in inducing stellar motion through the formation of clumps and spiral arms. Further investigation of this phenomenon promises to shed light on the broader questions of disk and planet formation, and may lead to insights into the formation of the Solar System itself.","(393, 14)","We test the effect of assumptions about stellar motion on the behavior of gravitational instabilities  in protoplanetary disks using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical models.

We assume that the PPD is in hydrostatic equilibrium.
We assume the PPD has a uniform density profile.
We also assume that the disk is axisymmetric.
We find that GIs are more likely to occur in disks that are axisymmetric and hydrostatically stable.
This is because axisymmetric disks are less likely to be perturbed by GIs than disks that are hydrostatically unstable.
We conclude that axisymmetric PPDs are more stable to GIs than hydrostatically-unstable PPDs.","(497, 16)","(106, 7)"

Data replication is essential to ensure reliability, availability and fault-tolerance of massive distributed applications over ","Data replication is essential to ensure reliability, availability and fault-tolerance of massive distributed applications over large scale systems such as the Internet. However, these systems are prone to partitioning, which by Brewer's CAP theorem [1] makes it impossible to use a strong consistency criterion like atomicity. Eventual consistency [2] guaranties that all replicas eventually converge to a common state when the participants stop updating.

However, it fails to fully specify shared objects and requires additional non-intuitive and error-prone distributed specification techniques, that must take into account all possible concurrent histories of updates to specify this common state [3]. This approach, that can lead to specifications as complicated as the implementations themselves, is limited by a more serious issue. The concurrent specification of objects uses the notion of concurrent events. In message-passing systems, two events are concurrent if they are enforced by different processes and each process enforced its event before it received the notification message from the other process. In other words, the notion of concurrency depends on the implementation of the object, not on its specification. Consequently, the final user may not know if two events are concurrent without explicitly tracking the messages exchanged by the processes.

A specification should be independent of the system on which it is implemented.

We believe that an object should be totally specified by two facets: its abstract data type, that characterizes its sequential executions, and a consistency criterion, that defines how it is supposed to behave in a distributed environment. Not only sequential specification helps repeal the problem of intention, it also allows to use the well studied and understood notions of languages and automata. This makes possible to apply all the tools developed for sequential systems, from their simple definition using structures and classes to the most advanced techniques like model checking and formal verification. Eventual consistency (EC) imposes no constraint on the convergent state, that very few depends on the sequential specification. For example, an implementation that ignores all the updates is eventually consistent, as all replicas converge to the initial state. We propose a new consistency criterion, update consistency (UC), in which the convergent state must be obtained by a total ordering of the updates, that contains the sequential order of each","(422, 16)","Update consistency in partitionable systems has been an ongoing issue in distributed computing for quite some time. The need to maintain consistency and coherence of data across different partitions in these systems has become paramount with the emergence of big data. This paper presents a novel approach to update consistency in partitionable systems. Our approach is designed to address the challenges of achieving consistency in distributed systems that have to tolerate network partitions.

The proposed approach leverages optimistic replication techniques to ensure update consistency in partitionable systems. We introduce a new algorithm, called CRDT, that allows nodes to converge on consistent state in the presence of partitions. CRDT focuses on the convergent replication of data types, making it an ideal approach for maintaining consistency across different nodes. The algorithm takes advantage of the idempotent and commutative properties of different data types to ensure convergence, without relying on the availability of a central coordinating node.

Our experimental evaluation shows that CRDT achieves a high level of update consistency in real-world systems, outperforming existing approaches in terms of speed and accuracy. Based on the results obtained, we believe our approach has the potential to revolutionize the way consistency is maintained in partitionable systems.

In summary, this paper presents a novel solution that addresses the problem of update consistency in partitionable systems. Our approach based on CRDT provides a robust and scalable framework for maintaining consistency in distributed systems that have to withstand network partitions. This research work will undoubtedly be of great interest to professionals working in the field of distributed systems and will also benefit developers working on big data systems.","(290, 13)","Data replication is essential to ensure reliability, availability and fault-tolerance of massive distributed applications over  partitionable systems.

Complex shapes are widely used to design products in several industries such as aeronautics, automotive ","Complex shapes are widely used to design products in several industries such as aeronautics, automotive and domestic appliances. Several variations of their curvatures and orientations generate difficulties during their manufacturing or the machining of dies used in moulding, injection and forging. Analysis of several parts highlights two levels of difficulties between three types of shapes: prismatic parts with simple geometrical shapes, aeronautic structure parts composed of several shallow pockets and forging dies composed of several deep cavities which often contain protrusions. This paper mainly concerns High Speed Machining (HSM) of these dies which represent the highest complexity level because of the shapes' geometry and their topology. Five axes HSM is generally required for such complex shaped parts but 3 axes machining can be sufficient for dies. Evolutions in HSM CAM software and machine tools lead to an important increase in time for machining preparation. Analysis stages of the CAD model particularly induce this time increase which is required for a wise choice of cutting tools and machining strategies. Assistance modules for prismatic parts machining features identification in CAD models are widely implemented in CAM software. In spite of the last CAM evolutions, these kinds of CAM modules are undeveloped for aeronautical structure parts and forging dies. Development of new CAM modules for the extraction of relevant machining areas as well as the definition of the topological relations between these areas must make it possible for the machining assistant to reduce the machining preparation time. In this paper, a model developed for the description of complex shape parts topology is presented. It is based on machining areas extracted for the construction of geometrical features starting from CAD models of the parts. As topology is described in order to assist machining assistant during machining process generation, the difficulties associated with tasks he carried out are analyzed at first. The topological model presented after is based on the basic geometrical features extracted. Topological relations which represent the framework of the model are defined between the basic geometrical features which are gathered afterwards in macro-features. Approach used for the identification of these macro-features is also presented in this paper.

Detailed application on the construction of the topological model of forging dies is presented in the last part of the paper.","(403, 17)","This paper presents a topological model for machining of parts with complex shapes. The manufacturing of parts with complex geometries is an essential task that presents several challenges in terms of tool accessibility, tool path generation, and surface quality. The proposed model offers a systematic approach that considers the topological features of the part and allows the generation of a machining plan that satisfies the design constraints.

The model is based on the concept of feature recognition, which involves the identification of geometric entities that carry relevant information for manufacturing. A set of topological rules that define the connection between these features is then established, allowing the construction of a topological model that represents the part's geometrical structure. The model reduces the complexity of the part's shape by partitioning it into simpler regions, each of which can be manufactured independently.

The topological model is employed to generate a set of machining features, which are used as input for the tool path generation algorithm. The approach enables the generation of optimal tool paths for each machining feature, considering the accessibility of the tool and the surface quality requirements. The resulting tool paths are smooth and avoid collisions with the part geometry, ensuring the quality of the machined surface.

The proposed approach is demonstrated on parts with complex geometries, showing that the topological model enables the reduction of the manufacturing time, the avoidance of collisions between the tool and the part, and the improvement of surface quality. The approach is effective for both 2.5D and 3D parts and shows promising results in terms of efficiency and robustness.

In conclusion, this paper presents a novel topological model for machining of parts with complex shapes, based on feature recognition and explicit topological rules. The approach enables the generation of optimal tool paths that ensure the quality of the machined surface, while reducing the manufacturing time and avoiding collisions between the tool and the part geometry.

Let $H$ be a digraph possibly with loops and $D$ a loopless digraph whose arcs ","Let $H$ be a digraph possibly with loops and $D$ a loopless digraph whose arcs are colored with the vertices of $H$ ($D$ is said to be an $H-$colored digraph). If $W=(x_{0},\ldots,x_{n})$ is an open walk in $D$ and $i\in \{1,\ldots,n-1\}$, we say that there is an obstruction on $x_{i}$ whenever $(color(x_{i-1},x_{i}),color(x_{i},x_{i+1}))\notin A(H)$. A $(k,l,H)$-kernel by walks in an $H$-colored digraph $D$ ($k\geq 2$, $l\geq 1$), is a subset $S$ of vertices of $D$, such that, for every pair of different vertices in $S$, every walk between them has at least $k-1$ obstructions, and for every $x\in V(D)\setminus S$ there exists an $xS$-walk with at most $l-1$ obstructions.

This concept generalize the concepts of kernel, $(k,l)$-kernel, kernel by monochromatic paths, and kernel by $H$-walks. If $D$ is an $H$-colored digraph, an $H$-class partition is a partition $\mathscr{F}$ of $A(D)$ such that, for every $\{(u,v),(v,w)\}\subseteq A(D)$, $(color(u,v),color(v,w))\in A(H)$ iff there exists $F\in \mathscr{F}$ such that $\{(u,v),(v,w)\}\subseteq F$. The $H$-class digraph relative to $\mathscr{F}$, denoted by $C_{\mathscr{F}}(D)$, is the digraph such that $V(C_{\mathscr{F}}(D))=\mathscr{F}$, and $(F,G)\in A(C_{\mathscr{F}}(D))$ iff there exist $(u,v)\in F$ and $(v,w)\in G$ with $\{u,v,w\}\subseteq V(D)$.

We will show sufficient conditions on $\mathscr{F}$ and $C_{\mathscr{F}}(D)$ to guarantee the existence of $(k,l,H)$-kernels by walks in $H$-colored digraphs, and we will show that some conditions are tight. For instance, we will show that if an $H$-colored digraph $D$ has an $H$-class partition in which every class induces a strongly connected digraph, and has a obstruction-free vertex, then for every $k\geq 2$, $D$ has a $(k,k-1,H)$-kernel by walks. Despite finding $(k,l)$-kernels is a $NP$-complete problem, some hypothesis presented in this paper can be verified in polynomial time.","(651, 9)","This paper presents a study on $(k,l,H)$-kernels by walks and the H-class digraph, a topic which has become increasingly popular in recent years. The main objective in this research is to establish a connection between the $(k,l,H)$-kernels and the H-class digraph, and to explore the algorithmic potential of the identified links.

The concept of $(k,l,H)$-kernels are central in the study of graph theory, and provide a measure of the robustness of a graph against structural changes. In this sense, they have important applications in areas such as telecommunication, transportation networks, and social networks. On the other hand, the H-class digraph is a class of oriented graphs with unique features, which include being strongly connected, transitive, and having a small diameter.

In this paper, different methods are employed to study the relationship between the $(k,l,H)$-kernels and the H-class digraph. One of the main results established is that an efficient characterization of H-class digraphs is possible through the use of $(k,l,H)$-kernels by walks. More specifically, it is shown that a directed graph of size n is an H-class digraph if and only if there exists an $O(n^2)$ algorithm to compute its $(k,l,H)$-kernels by walks.

The implications of this result are significant, as it offers new possibilities for the practical use of $(k,l,H)$-kernels and H-class digraphs, both in theoretical and applied contexts. One possible application is in the design of more efficient routing algorithms on transportation networks, which could benefit from the improved measures of robustness provided by $(k,l,H)$-kernels by walks. Similarly, the efficient characterization of H-class digraphs opens up new avenues for the study of other types of graphs and their properties.

In summary, this paper contributes to the understanding of $(k,l,H)$-kernels by walks and the H-class digraph, and offers new insights into their algorithmic potential and practical applications. The approach presented here may serve as a starting point for further research, and may inspire future studies on related topics in graph theory and computer science.","(442, 13)","Let $H$ be a digraph possibly with loops and $D$ a loopless digraph whose arcs  are colored with colors from the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$.

We also prove that if $D$ has a vertex $v$ such that the number of arcs going out of $v$ is greater than $K$ and the number of arcs coming into $v$ is less than $L$, then $v$ cannot be part of any $(H,K,L)-$","Let $H$ be a digraph possibly with loops and $D$ a loopless digraph whose arcs $(u,v)$ are $H$-walkable if $u$ and $v$ are adjacent in $H$.

Theoretical and observational studies on the turbulence of the interstellar medium developed fast in the ","Theoretical and observational studies on the turbulence of the interstellar medium developed fast in the past decades. The theory of supersonic magnetized turbulence, as well as the understanding of projection effects of observed quantities, are still in progress. In this work we explore the characterization of the turbulent cascade and its damping from observational spectral line profiles. We address the difference of ion and neutral velocities by clarifying the nature of the turbulence damping in the partially ionized. We provide theoretical arguments in favor of the explanation of the larger Doppler broadening of lines arising from neutral species compared to ions as arising from the turbulence damping of ions at larger scales. Also, we compute a number of MHD numerical simulations for different turbulent regimes and explicit turbulent damping, and compare both the 3-dimensional distributions of velocity and the synthetic line profile distributions. From the numerical simulations, we place constraints on the precision with which one can measure the 3D dispersion depending on the turbulence sonic Mach number. We show that no universal correspondence between the 3D velocity dispersions measured in the turbulent volume and minima of the 2D velocity dispersions available through observations exist. For instance, for subsonic turbulence the correspondence is poor at scales much smaller than the turbulence injection scale, while for supersonic turbulence the correspondence is poor for the scales comparable with the injection scale. We provide a physical explanation of the existence of such a 2D-3D correspondence and discuss the uncertainties in evaluating the damping scale of ions that can be obtained from observations. However, we show that the statistics of velocity dispersion from observed line profiles can provide the spectral index and the energy transfer rate of turbulence. Also, comparing two similar simulations with different viscous coefficients it was possible to constrain the turbulent cut-off scale. This may especially prove useful since it is believed that ambipolar diffusion may be one of the dominant dissipative mechanism in star-forming regions. In this case, the determination of the ambipolar diffusion scale may be used as a complementary method for the determination of magnetic field intensity in collapsing cores. We discuss the implications of our findings in terms of a new approach to magnetic field measurement proposed by Li & Houde (2008).","(402, 15)","In this study, we investigate the damping of magnetic hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in partially ionized gases and its effect on the difference of velocities between neutrals and ions. The presence of neutrals in a plasma can significantly affect its dynamics due to the drag force they exert on ions. We perform numerical simulations of partially ionized gas using a hybrid code that couples MHD equations with neutral gas dynamics. 

Our results show that the presence of neutrals leads to enhanced damping of MHD turbulence in the partially ionized gas. This damping increases with the relative density of neutrals and can have a significant impact on the observed difference in velocities between ions and neutrals. We observe that the difference in velocities decreases with increasing neutral density due to the increased drag force on the ions. 

Moreover, we investigate the role of ion-neutral collisions in damping the MHD turbulence. Our simulations show that collisions between ions and neutrals are the dominant mechanism for damping in partially ionized gases. These collisions lead to significant drag forces on the ions and hence to enhanced damping of MHD turbulence. 

We further analyze the effects of neutralization on the ion temperature and the anisotropy of the ion velocity distribution. Our simulations show that neutralization can lead to a significant increase in the ion temperature by reducing the efficiency of ion heating by turbulent dissipation. In addition, it can cause the velocity distribution of the ions to become more isotropic. 

In summary, our simulations demonstrate that the presence of neutrals in partially ionized gas can significantly affect the damping of MHD turbulence and the observed velocity difference between ions and neutrals. Our results highlight the importance of considering the effects of neutrals in models of astrophysical plasmas, where they are known to be present in significant amounts.","(322, 14)","Theoretical and observational studies on the turbulence of the interstellar medium developed fast in the 1990s and early 2000s.

We also examine the observed difference in velocities between neutrals and ions in such a gas.

Our research is motivated by the fact that the interstellar medium is often partially ionized due to the presence of neutral atoms and molecules. This partial ionization can significantly affect the dynamics of MHD turbulence, which plays a crucial role in the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. To investigate this effect, we use a combination of numerical simulations and analytical models. Our numerical simulations are based on the magnetohydrodynamic equations, which describe the behavior of fluids in the presence of magnetic fields. We solve these equations using a high-order finite difference method, which allows us to accurately capture the small-scale dynamics of the turbulence.

In our simulations, we model the partially ionized gas as a two-fluid system, consisting of ions and neutrals. We assume that the ions are coupled to the magnetic field through the Lorentz force, while the neutrals are not. This allows us to study the relative motion between the ions and neutrals, which is a key aspect of our research. We find that the partial ionization leads to a significant reduction in the damping rate of the MHD turbulence, compared to the fully ionized case. This is because the neutrals act as a buffer, reducing the coupling between the ions and the magnetic field.

Our analytical models provide further insight into the physical mechanisms underlying this effect. We derive a set of equations that describe the evolution of the ion and neutral velocities, as well as the magnetic field. By solving these equations, we find that the neutrals tend to lag behind the ions, resulting in a velocity difference between the two species.

In this paper we introduce the word ""fresco"" to denote a \ $[\lambda]-$primitive monogenic geometric ","In this paper we introduce the word ""fresco"" to denote a \ $[\lambda]-$primitive monogenic geometric (a,b)-module. The study of this ""basic object"" (generalized Brieskorn module with one generator) which corresponds to the minimal filtered (regular) differential equation satisfied by a relative de Rham cohomology class, began in [B.09] where the first structure theorems are proved. Then in [B.10] we introduced the notion of theme which corresponds in the \ $[\lambda]-$primitive case to frescos having a unique Jordan-H{\""o}lder sequence. Themes correspond to asymptotic expansion of a given vanishing period, so to the image of a fresco in the module of asymptotic expansions. For a fixed relative de Rham cohomology class (for instance given by a smooth differential form $d-$closed and $df-$closed) each choice of a vanishing cycle in the spectral eigenspace of the monodromy for the eigenvalue \ $exp(2i\pi.\lambda)$ \ produces a \ $[\lambda]-$primitive theme, which is a quotient of the fresco associated to the given relative de Rham class itself. The first part of this paper shows that, for any \ $[\lambda]-$primitive fresco there exists an unique Jordan-H{\""o}lder sequence (called the principal J-H. sequence) with corresponding quotients giving the opposite of the roots of the Bernstein polynomial in a non decreasing order.

Then we introduce and study the semi-simple part of a given fresco and we characterize the semi-simplicity of a fresco by the fact for any given order of the roots of its Bernstein polynomial we may find a J-H. sequence making them appear with this order. Then, using the parameter associated to a rank \ 2 \ \ $[\lambda]-$primitive theme, we introduce inductiveley a numerical invariant, that we call the \ $\alpha-$invariant, which depends polynomially on the isomorphism class of a fresco (in a sens which has to be defined) and which allows to give an inductive way to produce a sub-quotient rank \ 2 \ theme of a given \ $[\lambda]-$primitive fresco assuming non semi-simplicity. In the last section we prove a general existence result which naturally associate a fresco to any relative de Rham cohomology class of a proper holomorphic function of a complex manifold onto a disc. This is, of course, the motivation for the study of frescos.","(468, 10)","This paper studies the asymptotic properties of a vanishing period and presents a general existence theorem and basic properties of frescos within this context. Our main result shows the existence of a solution for a particular class of problems involving a vanishing period, and establishes a representation formula for it. The proof relies on a combination of techniques including the theory of periodic homogenization and the method of Fourier analysis.

In addition to the existence theorem, we investigate several basic properties of frescos and prove that they are a useful tool for studying the behavior of solutions near a vanishing period. Specifically, we show that frescos are uniformly bounded and have an asymptotic expansion in powers of the period that vanishes. Moreover, we explore the connection between the asymptotic behavior of frescos and the behavior of solutions of the original problem.

Our analysis has interesting applications in many fields, including elasticity, electromagnetics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. Indeed, many problems in these areas can be recast as problems involving a vanishing period, and our results provide a useful framework for their analysis. For instance, we show that the behavior of wave propagation in a heterogeneous medium can be understood in terms of fresco expansions.

Emission lines from high density molecular tracers were detected, i.e. NH$_3$ (1,1), NH$_3$ (2,2), N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0), HC$_3$N (3-2), HC$_3$N (10-9), CS (2-1), CH$_3$OH (2$_0-1_0$)A$^+$ and CH$_3$OH (2$_{-1}-1_{-1}$)E.

Velocity gradients of more than 1 km s$^{-1}$ are present in Lupus 1 and 3 and multiple gas components are present in these clouds along some lines of sight.

Lupus 1 is the cloud richest in high density cores, 8 cores were detected in it, 5 cores were detected in Lupus 3 and only 2 in Lupus 4. The intensity of the three species HC$_3$N, NH$_3$ and N$_2$H$^+$ changes significantly in the various cores: cores that are brighter in HC$_3$N are fainter or undetected in NH$_3$ and N$_2$H$^+$ and vice versa. We found that the column density ratios HC$_3$N/N$_2$H$^+$ and HC$_3$N/NH$_3$ change by one order of magnitude between the cores, indicating that also the chemical abundance of these species is different. The time dependent chemical code that we used to model our cores shows that the HC$_3$N/N$_2$H$^+$ and HC$_3$N/NH$_3$ ratios decrease with time therefore the observed column density of these species can be used as an indicator of the chemical evolution of dense cores. On this base we classified 5 out of 8 cores in Lupus 1 and 1 out of 5 cores in Lupus 3 as very young protostars or prestellar cores. Comparing the millimetre cores population with the population of the more evolved young stellar objects identified in the Spitzer surveys, we conclude that in Lupus 3 the bulk of the star formation activity has already passed and only a moderate number of stars are still forming. On the contrary, in Lupus 1 star formation is on-going and several dense cores are still in the pre--/proto--stellar phase. Lupus 4 is at an intermediate stage, with a smaller number of individual objects.","(483, 11)","The Lupus molecular cloud is a crucial region for studying star formation in our galaxy. In this paper, we present the results of a deep, multi-line spectral imaging study of dense cores within the Lupus molecular cloud region. Our analysis focuses on the properties of the gas within these cores, including its temperature, density, and chemical composition.

Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX), we obtained high-resolution images of several molecular line transitions, including 13CO, C18O, and N2H+. The observations were conducted at a frequency of 86 GHz and covered a total area of approximately 1 square degree.

After analyzing the spectra obtained from the observations, we identified 35 dense cores within the Lupus molecular cloud region. These cores have typical sizes of 0.1 to 0.3 parsecs and masses ranging from 0.2 to 14 solar masses. We also found that the cores have typical gas temperatures of around 10 Kelvin and densities of approximately 10^4 cm^-3.

Using the molecular line observations, we derived the chemical composition of the dense cores and found that they contain a variety of complex organic molecules, including methanol, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde. We also observed significant variability in the chemical composition between individual cores.

Our results provide valuable insights into the physical and chemical processes involved in the formation and evolution of dense cores within the Lupus molecular cloud.

The 6.7-GHz methanol maser line was used to identify regions of high-density gas and potential sites of low-mass star formation.

The cores in Lupus 1 are generally more massive and have higher densities than those in Lupus 3. In contrast, the Lupus 4 cloud contains only a few dense cores, which are smaller and less massive than those in the other two clouds. The radial velocities and line widths of the observed lines indicate that the dense cores in all three clouds are in motion, with some cores showing evidence of infall or outflow.

We investigate a class of moment problems, namely recovering a measure supported on the graph ","We investigate a class of moment problems, namely recovering a measure supported on the graph of a function from partial knowledge of its moments, as for instance in some problems of optimal transport or density estimation. We show that the sole knowledge of first degree moments of the function, namely linear measurements, is sufficient to obtain asymptotically all the other moments by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite relax-ations (viewed as moment matrix completion problems) with a specific sparsity inducing criterion related to a weighted 1-norm of the moment sequence of the measure. The resulting sequence of optimal solutions converges to the whole moment sequence of the measure which is shown to be the unique optimal solution of a certain infinite-dimensional linear optimization problem (LP). Then one may recover the function by a recent extraction algorithm based on the Christoffel-Darboux kernel associated with the measure. Finally, the support of such a measure supported on a graph is a meager, very thin (hence sparse) set. Therefore the LP on measures with this sparsity inducing criterion can be interpreted as an analogue for infinite-dimensional signals of the LP in super-resolution for (sparse) atomic signals. In data science, it is often relevant to process moments of a signal instead of the signal itself. For complex valued signals, the moments are Fourier coefficients, and many filtering operations are efficiently carried out in the sequence of moments. In numerical approximation algorithms, many operations on real valued signals are more efficiently implemented in their sequence of Chebyshev coefficients [19]. In the moment-SOS hierarchy approach, many nonlinear nonconvex problems are reformulated and solved approximately in the sequence of moments; see [13, 12] and references therein. Once moments or approximate moments have been computed, one is faced with the inverse problem of reconstructing the signal from its moments. The recent work [15] describes an algorithm based on the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, to recover the graph of a function from knowledge of its moments. Its novelty (and distinguishing feature) is to approximate the graph of the function (rather than the function itself) with a semialgebraic function (namely a minimizer of a sum of squares of polynomials) with L 1 and pointwise convergence guarantees for an increasing number of input moments. In","(418, 14)","In many real-world applications, the data gathered is incomplete. Graphs, in particular, can suffer from missing information due to various factors such as unsuccessful transmissions, measurement errors or sensor failures. In this paper, we present a novel approach to recover graphs from incomplete moment information. Our method employs a convex optimization framework that leverages the low-rank structure inherent in graphs to accurately recover missing entries.

We begin by examining the notion of moments in graph recovery and establish a correspondence between moments and the graph structure. We then formulate the problem of graph recovery from moment information as a matrix completion problem with a sparsity constraint. To solve this problem, we propose an optimization framework that minimizes a convex objective function subject to this constraint.

To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive simulations on synthetic data as well as real-world data. Our experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of recovery accuracy, especially for large-scale graphs. Moreover, our approach is computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world applications.

We also explore the sensitivity of our method to different parameters. We show that our method is robust to variations in the level of sparsity, measurement noise, and graph size. We also demonstrate the superior performance of our method over other state-of-the-art approaches for various levels of missing information.

In conclusion, our proposed approach provides an effective means for recovering graphs from incomplete moment information. We demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing methods and is applicable to real-world scenarios. Our method is scalable and robust to variations in the parameters, making it a practical tool for various applications such as network analysis, image and video processing and scientific computing.","(318, 16)","We investigate a class of moment problems, namely recovering a measure supported on the graph  G  = ( V, E ) from incomplete moment information.

This scenario arises in various applications, such as signal processing, machine learning, and statistical inference, where only partial information about the underlying distribution is available.

Our goal is to develop efficient algorithms for recovering the graph structure  G  from the given incomplete moment information.

The constraints ensure that the recovered graph satisfies the properties of a valid graph, such as non-negativity of edge weights and absence of self-loops.

To solve this optimization problem, we employ a combination of techniques from convex optimization and graph theory. Specifically, we utilize the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, a popular first-order optimization method, to iteratively update the graph structure.

Evidential reasoning in expert systems has often used ad-hoc uncertainty calculi. Although it is generally ","Evidential reasoning in expert systems has often used ad-hoc uncertainty calculi. Although it is generally accepted that probability theory provides a firm theoretical foundation, researchers have found some problems with its use as a workable uncertainty calculus. Among these problems are representation of ignorance, consistency of probabilistic judgements, and adjustment of a priori judgements with experience. The application of metaprobability theory to evidential reasoning is a new approach to solving these problems.

Metaprobability theory can be viewed as a way to provide soft or hard constraints on beliefs in much the same manner as the Dempster-Shafer theory provides constraints on probability masses on subsets of the state space. Thus, we use the Dempster-Shafer theory, an alternative theory of evidential reasoning to illuminate metaprobability theory as a theory of evidential reasoning. The goal of this paper is to compare how metaprobability theory and Dempster-Shafer theory handle the adjustment of beliefs with evidence with respect to a particular thought experiment. Sections 2 and 3 give brief descriptions of the metaprobability and Dempster-Shafer theories.

Metaprobability theory deals with higher order probabilities applied to evidential reasoning. Dempster-Shafer theory is a generalization of probability theory which has evolved from a theory of upper and lower probabilities.

Section 4 describes a thought experiment and the metaprobability and DempsterShafer analysis of the experiment. The thought experiment focuses on forming beliefs about a population with 6 types of members {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

A type is uniquely defined by the values of three features: A, B, C. That is, if the three features of one member of the population were known then its type could be ascertained. Each of the three features has two possible values, (e.g.

A can be either ""a0"" or ""al""). Beliefs are formed from evidence accrued from two sensors: sensor A, and sensor B. Each sensor senses the corresponding defining feature. Sensor A reports that half of its observations are ""a0"" and half the observations are 'al'. Sensor B reports that half of its observations are ``b0,' and half are ""bl"". Based on these two pieces of evidence, what should be the beliefs on the distribution of types in the population? Note that the third feature is not observed by any sensor.","(425, 21)","In the field of evidential reasoning, a growing interest has been devoted to metaprobability and Dempster-Shafer theory. Metaprobability encompasses a set of mathematical tools aimed at quantifying the uncertainty about the probabilities assigned to a given event. Meanwhile, Dempster-Shafer theory extends the Bayesian framework, allowing us to manage nonprobabilistic forms of uncertainty.

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in the application of metaprobability and Dempster-Shafer theory in evidential reasoning. To do so, we first introduce the basic concepts underlying probability theory, including the laws of probability and Bayes' theorem. We then discuss the limitations of the Bayesian approach, emphasizing the necessity of extending it to handle different types of uncertainty.

Next, we provide a formal definition of metaprobability, highlighting its unique features and mathematical properties. Specifically, we explain how metaprobability allows us to quantify the belief we have in a particular probability distribution, given a set of observations. We then highlight the key advancements that have been made in applying metaprobability to different domains, including medical diagnosis, forensic science, and engineering.

We also explore the theoretical foundations of the Dempster-Shafer theory, which is based on the concept of belief functions. We explain how belief functions allow us to represent and manage nonprobabilistic forms of uncertainty, such as ignorance and ambiguity. We also show how the combination of belief functions can be used to derive a coherent probability distribution, even when the available information is incomplete or contradictory.

Finally, we present several case studies that illustrate the practical applications of metaprobability and Dempster-Shafer theory in evidential reasoning. These examples include the diagnosis of genetic disorders, the analysis of forensic evidence, and the prediction of natural disasters. We conclude by highlighting the main contributions and challenges of these approaches, as well as future research directions in this exciting and rapidly developing field.","(341, 15)","Evidential reasoning in expert systems has often used ad-hoc uncertainty calculi.

This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the integration of MPT with Dempster's rule of combination (DRC) in evidential reasoning. The research question guiding this study is: Can MPT enhance the accuracy and robustness of evidential reasoning when combined with DRC?

To address this question, we employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative methods. First, we conducted a comprehensive review of existing literature on MPT, DRC, and their applications in expert systems. This review aimed to identify the strengths and limitations of each approach, as well as their potential synergies. Next, we developed a novel framework for integrating MPT with DRC, which we refer to as the Metaprobability-Dempster-Shafer (MDS) framework. This framework leverages the strengths of both MPT and DRC to provide a more robust and accurate approach to evidential reasoning.

We evaluated the MDS framework through a series of experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results showed that the MDS framework significantly outperformed both MPT alone and DRC alone in terms of accuracy and robustness. Specifically, the MDS framework demonstrated improved performance in handling uncertain and conflicting evidence, as well as in reducing the impact of outliers and noisy data. These findings suggest that the integration of MDT and DRC can lead to more accurate and robust evidential reasoning.

The implications of this study are far-reaching, with potential applications in various domains, including expert systems, decision support systems, and artificial intelligence.

Background: There is uncertainty about the burden of severe outcomes associated with RSV and influenza ","Background: There is uncertainty about the burden of severe outcomes associated with RSV and influenza in children.

Methods: We have applied previously developed methodology to estimate the rates of influenza and RSV-associated hospitalizations with different diagnoses in different age subgroups of US children between the 2003-04 through the 2009-10 seasons.

Results: The average annual rates (per 100,000) of influenza and RSV-associated hospitalizations for any cause excluding asthma (ICD-9 code 493) in the principal diagnosis with a respiratory cause (ICD-9 codes 460-519) in the diagnosis (either principal or secondary) were 173.1(95%CI (134.3,212.6)) (influenza) vs. 2336(2209,2463) (RSV) (age <1y); 77.9(51.1,105.2) vs.

625.7(540,711.5) (age 1y); 56.3(40.9,72.2) vs. 324.2(275.1,375) (age 2y); 44.6(32.9,56.6) vs. 172.2(134.2,211) (age 3y); 36.4(27.7,45.3) vs.

89.7(60.6,117.8) (age 4y); 36.6(29.3,43.9) vs. 62.3(38.8,86.4) (ages 5-6y); 20.5(16.3,24.6) vs. 30.2(16.1,43.9) (ages 7-11y); and 16.1(10.6,21.7) vs.

36.9(17.8,55.9) (ages 12-17y). The rates of RSV-associated hospitalizations with asthma as a secondary (non-principal) diagnosis were 162.6(143.6,181.6) (age <1y), 144.7(120.8,168.2) (age 1y), 99.5(82.3,116.8) (age 2y), 60.9(46.4,75.3) (age 3y), 23.5(10.7,36.4) (age 4y), 16.1(5.1,27) (ages 5-6y), 11.4(4.7,18.3) (ages 7-11y), and 15.8(4.9,26.7) (ages 12-17y).

Conclusions: The estimated rates of RSV-associated hospitalizations in young children are high, with those rates declining rapidly with age. Additionally, the estimated rates of RSV-associated hospitalizations with asthma as a secondary diagnosis in young children, combined with data on the prevalence of asthma in those age groups suggest very high rates of RSV-associated hospitalizations in young children with asthma. Those children may be considered as potential target groups for RSV-related mitigation efforts.","(395, 7)","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are two of the most common respiratory viruses that cause hospitalizations among children in the United States. This study aims to investigate the pediatric hospitalizations associated with RSV and influenza and their frequency of presenting with asthma as a secondary diagnosis.

The data for this study was obtained using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID) from 2016. The study focused on children under the age of 18 years who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of RSV or influenza, or both. The analysis included 84,375 pediatric hospitalizations for RSV and 73,841 for influenza.

The study found that RSV was associated with a higher proportion of hospitalizations compared to influenza (56.4% versus 43.6%). Moreover, RSV-related hospitalizations had a longer length of stay as compared to influenza-related hospitalizations (mean 3.5 days versus 2.7 days). Among children hospitalized with RSV, 12.7% had asthma as a secondary diagnosis, whereas 9.5% of children hospitalized with influenza had asthma as a secondary diagnosis.

Further analysis demonstrated that children hospitalized with both RSV and asthma had an increased length of hospital stay as compared to those without asthma (mean 5.2 days versus 3.2 days). Additionally, children hospitalized with both influenza and asthma also had an increased length of hospital stay (mean 3.8 days versus 2.5 days). The study revealed that children with asthma as a secondary diagnosis were more likely to require mechanical ventilation and have a higher mean cost of hospitalization.

In conclusion, RSV-related hospitalizations had a longer length of stay and occurred more frequently than influenza-related hospitalizations. Asthma was found to be a common secondary diagnosis among children hospitalized with both RSV and influenza, which resulted in a longer length of stay and a higher mean cost of hospitalization. This study highlights the importance of prevention and treatment of RSV and influenza, particularly in children with asthma to reduce hospitalizations, improve outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs.","(364, 14)","Background: There is uncertainty about the burden of severe outcomes associated with RSV and influenza  in pediatric populations, particularly when asthma is a comorbid condition.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2010 to 2019. The study population consisted of children aged 0-17 years who were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of RSV or influenza. Asthma was identified as a secondary diagnosis using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between RSV and/or influenza hospitalizations and the presence of asthma.

Results: During the 10-year study period, there were 2,345,111 hospitalizations for RSV and 1,234,119 hospitalizations for influenza in children aged 0–17 years. The overall prevalence of asthma as a comorbid diagnosis was 14.5% among RSV hospitalizations and 12.3% among influenza hospitalizations. After adjusting for potential confounders, the multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between RSV hospitalization and asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-1.27). In contrast, the association between influenza hospitalization and asthma was not statistically significant (aOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99-1.09). Furthermore, the analysis showed that children with asthma were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and have longer hospital stays compared to those without asthma.

Discussion: The findings of this study suggest that RSV hospitalizations are associated with a higher prevalence of asthma, whereas influenza hospitalizations are not. This disparity may be attributed to differences in the pathophysiology of the two viruses and their effects on the respiratory system. The increased risk of severe outcomes, including ICU admission and prolonged hospital stays, among children with asthma highlights the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of RSV on this vulnerable population. The results of this study have important implications for public health policy and clinical practice, particularly in the development of strategies to prevent and manage RSV-related complications in children with asthma.

Furthermore, the analysis showed that children with asthma were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and have longer hospital stays compared to those without asthma.

Discussion: The findings of this study suggest that RSV hospitalizations are associated with a higher prevalence of asthma, whereas influenza hospitalizations are not. This disparity may be attributed to differences in the pathophysiology of the two viruses and their effects on the respiratory system. The increased risk of severe outcomes, including ICU admission and prolonged hospital stays, among children with asthma highlights the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of RSV on this vulnerable population. The results of this study have important implications for public health policy and clinical practice, particularly in the development of strategies to prevent and manage RSV-related complications in children with asthma. Future research should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of the RSV-asthma association and exploring the effectiveness of preventive measures, such as palivizumab","Background: There is uncertainty about the burden of severe outcomes associated with RSV and influenza (flu) in hospitalized children.
Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of RSV and flu as secondary diagnoses in pediatric hospitalizations.
Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of children aged 0 to 18 years hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of RSV or flu from 2010 to 2015.
Results: A total of 1,000,000 hospitalizations were analyzed.
RSV was the most common secondary diagnosis in children hospitalized with RSV (n = 1,001,000).
Influenza was the most frequent secondary diagnosis in hospitalized children with flu.
Conclusions: RSV is the most common cause of hospitalization in children with RSV.
Influenza is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among children hospitalized with flu.","(431, 16)","(145, 8)"

Between 1998 and 2004, the planning community has seen vast progress in terms of the ","Between 1998 and 2004, the planning community has seen vast progress in terms of the sizes of benchmark examples that domain-independent planners can tackle successfully. The key technique behind this progress is the use of heuristic functions based on relaxing the planning task at hand, where the relaxation is to assume that all delete lists are empty. The unprecedented success of such methods, in many commonly used benchmark examples, calls for an understanding of what classes of domains these methods are well suited for. In the investigation at hand, we derive a formal background to such an understanding.

We perform a case study covering a range of 30 commonly used STRIPS and ADL benchmark domains, including all examples used in the first four international planning competitions. We *prove* connections between domain structure and local search topology -- heuristic cost surface properties -- under an idealized version of the heuristic functions used in modern planners. The idealized heuristic function is called h^+, and differs from the practically used functions in that it returns the length of an *optimal* relaxed plan, which is NP-hard to compute. We identify several key characteristics of the topology under h^+, concerning the existence/non-existence of unrecognized dead ends, as well as the existence/non-existence of constant upper bounds on the difficulty of escaping local minima and benches. These distinctions divide the (set of all) planning domains into a taxonomy of classes of varying h^+ topology. As it turns out, many of the 30 investigated domains lie in classes with a relatively easy topology. Most particularly, 12 of the domains lie in classes where FFs search algorithm, provided with h^+, is a polynomial solving mechanism. We also present results relating h^+ to its approximation as implemented in FF. The behavior regarding dead ends is provably the same. We summarize the results of an empirical investigation showing that, in many domains, the topological qualities of h^+ are largely inherited by the approximation. The overall investigation gives a rare example of a successful analysis of the connections between typical-case problem structure, and search performance. The theoretical investigation also gives hints on how the topological phenomena might be automatically recognizable by domain analysis techniques. We outline some preliminary steps we made into that direction.","(412, 17)","This paper presents an investigation into the phenomenon of ignoring delete lists and its applicability in planning benchmarks, where local search topology is a key consideration. Delete lists are commonly used in heuristic planners to keep track of the deleted literals with respect to a given action. While these lists prove useful in certain scenarios, they can also act as a substantial barrier to efficiency for planners utilizing local search techniques.

To investigate the applicability of ignoring delete lists in planning benchmarks, we designed a series of experiments on the domain-independent benchmark set known as IPC-14. We utilized the Fast Downward planner with the LAMA-2011 configuration, a state-of-the-art planner that demonstrates high performance across applications. Our experiments were designed to test the strengths of ignoring delete lists across multiple domains, while also examining the relationship between complexity and efficiency.

Our results show that ignoring delete lists can provide significant benefits in domains with certain characteristics, particularly in those that exhibit high variability. In such domains, ignoring delete lists can reduce the search space and lead to more optimal solutions, while also reducing memory consumption. However, we found that these benefits are not exhibited across all domains and encouraged domain-specific analysis to identify optimal planner configurations.

In addition to the empirical results, we also reflect on the implications of ignoring delete lists and their impact on the broader field of AI planning. In particular, ignoring delete lists can be viewed as a form of approximate reasoning, where simplification and abstraction can lead to high efficiency. We argue that the field of AI planning should continue to explore such techniques, along with new methods and approaches to handle planning benchmarks effectively.

In conclusion, our results demonstrate that ignoring delete lists can be effective in planning benchmarks as a tool to enhance efficiency and reduce memory consumption, particularly in complex and variable domains. By exploring such techniques, AI planners can gain new insights into the search landscape, and ultimately improve their performance.","(360, 14)","Between 1998 and 2004, the planning community has seen vast progress in terms of the  efficiency and scalability of planning algorithms. However, despite these advancements, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of the local search topology in planning benchmarks. Specifically, the impact of ignoring delete lists on the performance of local search algorithms has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the effectiveness of ignoring delete lists in local search algorithms on various planning benchmarks.

To investigate this research question, we employed a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. Theoretically, we analyzed the conditions under which ignoring delete lists would lead to improved performance in local search algorithms. Empirically, we conducted a series of experiments on a range of planning benchmarks, including classical planning problems, planning with preferences, and planning under uncertainty. Our experimental setup involved comparing the performance of two local search algorithms: one that uses delete lists and another that ignores delete lists. We measured the performance of these algorithms in terms of solution quality, computation time, and convergence speed.

Our findings indicate that ignoring delete lists can indeed lead to improved performance on certain planning benchmarks. In particular, we observed that ignoring delete lists resulted in faster convergence speeds and better solution quality on problems with a large number of possible actions. This is because ignoring delete lists reduces the overhead associated with maintaining and updating delete lists, allowing the algorithm to focus more on exploring the search space. However, we also found that ignoring delete lists led to decreased performance on problems with a small number of possible actions, where the overhead of maintaining delete lists is relatively low.

Our results have significant implications for the design and implementation of local search algorithms in planning.

We present a CO(1-0) survey for cold molecular gas in a representative sample of 13 ","We present a CO(1-0) survey for cold molecular gas in a representative sample of 13 high-z radio galaxies (HzRGs) at 1.4<z<2.8, using the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We detect CO(1-0) emission associated with five sources: MRC 0114-211, MRC 0152-209, MRC 0156-252, MRC 1138-262 and MRC 2048-272. The CO(1-0) luminosities are in the range $L'_{\rm CO} \sim (5 - 9) \times 10^{10}$ K km/s pc$^{2}$. For MRC 0152-209 and MRC 1138-262 part of the CO(1-0) emission coincides with the radio galaxy, while part is spread on scales of tens of kpc and likely associated with galaxy mergers. The molecular gas mass derived for these two systems is M$_{\rm H2} \sim 6 \times 10^{10}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ (M$_{\rm H2}$/$L'_{\rm CO}$=0.8). For the remaining three CO-detected sources, the CO(1-0) emission is located in the halo (~50-kpc) environment. These three HzRGs are among the fainter far-IR emitters in our sample, suggesting that similar reservoirs of cold molecular halo gas may have been missed in earlier studies due to pre-selection of IR-bright sources. In all three cases the CO(1-0) is aligned along the radio axis and found beyond the brightest radio hot-spot, in a region devoid of 4.5$\mu$m emission in Spitzer imaging. The CO(1-0) profiles are broad, with velocity widths of ~ 1000 - 3600 km/s. We discuss several possible scenarios to explain these halo reservoirs of CO(1-0).

Following these results, we complement our CO(1-0) study with detections of extended CO from the literature and find at marginal statistical significance (95% level) that CO in HzRGs is preferentially aligned towards the radio jet axis. For the eight sources in which we do not detect CO(1-0), we set realistic upper limits of $L'_{\rm CO} \sim 3-4 \times 10^{10}$ K km/s pc$^{2}$. Our survey reveals a CO(1-0) detection rate of 38%, allowing us to compare the CO(1-0) content of HzRGs with that of other types of high-z galaxies.","(457, 13)","This research paper presents the results of a CO(1-0) survey conducted on a sample of high-redshift radio galaxies, with the aim of investigating the alignment between their molecular halo gas and their distant radio sources. Our sample consists of seven radio galaxies at redshifts between 2.6 and 3.8, observed using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).

Our analysis reveals that all seven radio galaxies in our sample exhibit molecular halos, which are spatially extended regions of CO(1-0) emission surrounding the radio source. The sizes of these halos range from tens to over a hundred kiloparsecs in diameter, and they contain an estimated mass of molecular gas between 9 x 10^10 and 3 x 10^11 solar masses.

Interestingly, we find that the alignment between the radio axis and the major axis of the molecular halo gas is statistically significant, with a probability of chance alignment of only 1.1%. This result supports the idea that the morphology of the molecular gas is influenced by the radio jet, perhaps through mechanical or radiative heating.

Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the molecular gas in the halos, including the kinematics, excitation, and metallicity. We find that the velocity structure of the molecular gas is consistent with rotation in a disk-like structure, suggesting that these halos represent a reservoir of gas that may eventually fuel star formation in the host galaxy. Additionally, we find evidence for shock excitation and enhanced metallicity in the gas, which could be due to feedback from the radio source.

In summary, our CO(1-0) survey of high-z radio galaxies reveals the presence of spatially extended molecular halos surrounding the radio sources, with a statistically significant alignment between the radio axis and the major axis of the halo gas. These results provide new insights into the interplay between radio jets and the interstellar medium in distant galaxies, and raise intriguing questions about the origin and evolution of molecular gas in the early Universe.","(361, 11)","We present a CO(1-0) survey for cold molecular gas in a representative sample of 13  high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) at z = 2-5. Our goal is to investigate the presence and distribution of molecular halo gas around these distant radio sources, which are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of their host galaxies. By probing the molecular gas content of these systems, we aim to shed light on the role of gas in fueling the growth of SMBHs and the evolution of galaxies during the epoch of reionization.

Our sample consists of 13 HzRGs selected from the literature, with redshifts ranging from 2.1 to 4.9. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the CO(1- -0) transition in these galaxies, which is a reliable tracer of cold molecular gas. The observations were carried out in band 3, with a frequency range of 84-115 GHz, and a resolution of 0.5 arcsec. We detected CO emission in 7 out of the 13 targets, with integrated line fluxes ranging from 0.5 to 10 Jy km s^(-1).

Our analysis reveals that the molecular gas in these HzRGs is distributed in a disk-like configuration, with a scale height of approximately 10-20 kpc. We also find that the CO emission is often aligned with the radio axis of the galaxy, suggesting a connection between the molecular gas and the radio source. This alignment is observed in 5 out of the 7 detected galaxies, with a median angle of 20 degrees between the CO major axis and the radio axis. Furthermore, we detect a significant correlation between the CO luminosity and the radio power of the galaxies, indicating that the molecular gas content is linked to the activity of the SMBH.

The implications of our findings are far-reaching. The presence of molecular gas in the halos of HzRGs suggests that these systems are actively accreting gas from their surroundings, which is necessary to fuel the growth of the SMBH. The alignment of the molecular gas with the radio axis implies that the gas is being funneled towards the center of the galaxy, where it can be accreted by the SMBH.

Determining deep holes is an important topic in decoding Reed-Solomon codes. Let $l\ge 1$ be ","Determining deep holes is an important topic in decoding Reed-Solomon codes.

Let $l\ge 1$ be an integer and $a_1,\ldots,a_l$ be arbitrarily given $l$ distinct elements of the finite field ${\bf F}_q$ of $q$ elements with the odd prime number $p$ as its characteristic. Let $D={\bf F}_q\backslash\{a_1,\ldots,a_l\}$ and $k$ be an integer such that $2\le k\le q-l-1$. In this paper, we study the deep holes of generalized projective Reed-Solomon code ${\rm GPRS}_q(D, k)$ of length $q-l+1$ and dimension $k$ over ${\bf F}_q$. For any $f(x)\in {\bf F}_q[x]$, we let $f(D)=(f(y_1),\ldots,f(y_{q-l}))$ if $D=\{y_1, ..., y_{q-l}\}$ and $c_{k-1}(f(x))$ be the coefficient of $x^{k-1}$ of $f(x)$. By using D\""ur's theorem on the relation between the covering radius and minimum distance of ${\rm GPRS}_q(D, k)$, we show that if $u(x)\in {\bf F}_q[x]$ with $\deg (u(x))=k$, then the received codeword $(u(D), c_{k-1}(u(x)))$ is a deep hole of ${\rm GPRS}_q(D, k)$ if and only if the sum $\sum\limits_{y\in I}y$ is nonzero for any subset $I\subseteq D$ with $\#(I)=k$. We show also that if $j$ is an integer with $1\leq j\leq l$ and $u_j(x):= \lambda_j(x-a_j)^{q-2}+\nu_j x^{k-1}+f_{\leq k-2}^{(j)}(x)$ with $\lambda_j\in {\bf F}_q^*$, $\nu_j\in {\bf F}_q$ and $f_{\leq{k-2}}^{(j)}(x)\in{\bf F}_q[x]$ being a polynomial of degree at most $k-2$, then $(u_j(D), c_{k-1}(u_j(x)))$ is a deep hole of ${\rm GPRS}_q(D, k)$ if and only if the sum $\binom{q-2}{k-1}(-a_j)^{q-1-k}\prod\limits_{y\in I}(a_j-y)+e$ is nonzero for any subset $I\subseteq D$ with $\#(I)=k$, where $e$ is the identity of the group ${\bf F}_q^*$. This implies that $(u_j(D), c_{k-1}(u_j(x)))$ is a deep hole of ${\rm GPRS}_q(D, k)$ if $p|k$.","(625, 8)","Generalized projective Reed-Solomon (GPRS) codes have been extensively researched for their various cryptographic and communication applications. In this paper, we investigate the deep holes of these codes, which are defined as the maximum subspaces over which the code can vanish. We establish conditions for the existence of deep holes and present efficient algorithms for finding them.

Our main contribution is the derivation of a bound on the dimension of deep holes in terms of the code parameters. We prove that for a GPRS code with parameters (n,k,s), the dimension of any deep hole is at most 2s-k. We also provide tight examples which demonstrate that this bound is achievable. Our result signifies a fundamental limitation on the maximum subspaces in which GPRS codes can vanish, and provides insights into their underlying algebraic structure.

We further extend our investigation to the case where GPRS codes are defined over an extension field. We show that the existence of deep holes is intimately related to the degree of the extension field, and we present an algorithm for finding deep holes in this context. Our algorithm is based on the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata (BMS) algorithm, and hence is computationally more efficient than the existing algorithm for finding deep holes in GPRS codes defined over a base field.

Finally, we highlight the significance of our results for applications such as secret sharing and network coding. In particular, we show how our bound on the dimension of deep holes can be used to design secret sharing schemes with optimal parameters. We also provide examples which demonstrate the advantage of using GPRS codes with deep holes in network coding applications.

A deep hole of the code is a point in the projective space $\mathbb A _{q^m } ^{(l )}$ that is not contained in any coset of the code but is contained in the closure of the union of all cosets of the code. In other words, a deep hole is a point that is ""farthest"" from the code in the sense that it is not contained in the code but is arbitrarily close to the code. The study of deep holes is motivated by the fact that they can significantly affect the performance of decoding algorithms for Reed--Solomon codes. In particular, deep holes can lead to errors in decoding, which can have serious consequences in applications such as data storage and communication","Determining deep holes is an important topic in decoding Reed-Solomon codes. Let $l\ge 1$ be  a positive integer and let $n$ be a positive integer.
A **generalized projective** $n$-dimensional **Reed-Solomon** (GPRS) code is an $n\times n$ matrix $R$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ such that $R_{i,j}=0$ if $i\neq j$ and $i,j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
The **deep hole** of a GPRS code $R$, denoted by $d(R)$, is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that there exists a $k\times k$ submatrix $S$ of $R\in \mathbb{F}_{q}^{n\times k}$ with $S_{i,i}=0$ for all $i=1,2,\ldots,k$.
For example, if $n=3$, $q=2$, and $R=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 \\
2 & 3 & 4 \\
3 && 5

The metric dimension, $\dim(G)$, and the fractional metric dimension, $\dim_f(G)$, of a graph $G$ have ","The metric dimension, $\dim(G)$, and the fractional metric dimension, $\dim_f(G)$, of a graph $G$ have been studied extensively. Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V(G)$, and let $d(x,y)$ denote the length of a shortest $x-y$ path in $G$. Let $k$ be a positive integer. For any $x,y \in V(G)$, let $d_k(x,y)=\min\{d(x,y), k+1\}$ and let $R_k\{x,y\}=\{z\in V(G): d_k(x,z) \neq d_k(y,z)\}$. A set $S \subseteq V(G)$ is a \emph{$k$-truncated resolving set} of $G$ if $|S \cap R_k\{x,y\}| \ge 1$ for any distinct $x,y\in V(G)$, and the \emph{$k$-truncated metric dimension} $\dim_k(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum cardinality over all $k$-truncated resolving sets of $G$. For a function $g$ defined on $V(G)$ and for $U \subseteq V(G)$, let $g(U)=\sum_{s\in U}g(s)$. A real-valued function $g:V(G) \rightarrow[0,1]$ is a \emph{$k$-truncated resolving function} of $G$ if $g(R_k\{x,y\}) \ge 1$ for any distinct $x, y\in V(G)$, and the \emph{fractional $k$-truncated metric dimension} $\dim_{k,f}(G)$ of $G$ is $\min\{g(V(G)): g \mbox{ is a $k$-truncated resolving function of }G\}$. Note that $\dim_{k,f}(G)$ reduces to $\dim_k(G)$ if the codomain of $k$-truncated resolving functions is restricted to $\{0,1\}$, and $\dim_{k,f}(G)=\dim_f(G)$ if $k$ is at least the diameter of $G$. In this paper, we study the fractional $k$-truncated metric dimension of graphs. For any connected graph $G$ of order $n\ge2$, we show that $1 \le \dim_{k,f}(G) \le \frac{n}{2}$; we characterize $G$ satisfying $\dim_{k,f}(G)$ equals $1$ and $\frac{n}{2}$, respectively. We examine $\dim_{k,f}(G)$ of some graph classes.

We also show the existence of non-isomorphic graphs $G$ and $H$ such that $\dim_k(G)=\dim_k(H)$ and $\dim_{k,f}(G)\neq \dim_{k,f}(H)$, and we examine the relation among $\dim(G)$, $\dim_f(G)$, $\dim_k(G)$ and $\dim_{k,f}(G)$. We conclude the paper with some open problems.","(674, 13)","In this paper, we introduce the fractional $k$-truncated metric dimension of graphs, a new metric dimension concept that properly generalizes the classical truncated metric dimension. Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k \geq 2$, we show how to construct a real-valued function $\mu_k: V(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the same localization property as the one for the fractional metric dimension. This allows us to define the fractional $k$-truncated metric dimension $\dim_{\mathrm{ft}, k}(G)$ as the smallest upper bound of $\sum_{v \in S} \mu_k(v)$ over all vertex subsets $S$ that have cardinality at least $k+1$ and induce a connected subgraph. 

We establish several results concerning the new concept. First, we demonstrate that the fractional $k$-truncated metric dimension is equivalent to the original truncated metric dimension when $k=2$. Our main result is that the fractional $k$-truncated metric dimension is always at most the fractional metric dimension. Moreover, when $k=3$ we prove that the fractional $3$-truncated metric dimension can be computed in polynomial time. 

We then study the behavior of the new metric dimension concept under graph operations. We show that it is subadditive under the Cartesian product and the strong product of graphs. Furthermore, we provide an example that demonstrates that the fractional $2$-truncated metric dimension is not necessarily subadditive under the join of graphs. 

Finally, we investigate the applications of the fractional $k$-truncated metric dimension in the context of certain communication problems. In particular, we show that the fractional $k$-truncated metric dimension can be used to bound the number of messages of a certain type of broadcasting problem, and we establish a tight lower bound for the case where $k=2$. 

We hope that the introduction of the fractional $k$-truncated metric dimension will motivate further research in this area, as it offers a versatile tool for solving several important problems in communication networks and distributed algorithms.","(397, 13)","The metric dimension, $\dim(G)$, and the fractional metric dimension, $\dim_f(G)$, of a graph $G$ have  been extensively studied in the field of graph theory.

Abstract Our ab initio all-electron relativistic Dirac-Fock (DF) calculations for seaborgium hexacarbonyl Sg(CO)6 and seaborgium ","Abstract Our ab initio all-electron relativistic Dirac-Fock (DF) calculations for seaborgium hexacarbonyl Sg(CO)6 and seaborgium hexaisocarbonyl Sg(OC)6 predict atomization energies of 68.80 and 64.30 eV. Our Dirac-Fock-Breit-Gaunt (DFBG) calculations for Sg(CO)6 and Sg(OC)6 yield atomization energies of 69.18 and 64.77 eV. However, our calculated non-relativistic (NR) Ae for Sg (CO)6 and Sg(OC)6 are 68.46 and 62.62 eV. The calculated isomerization energies at the DFBG, DF, and NR levels are 4.41,4.50 and 5.83 eV. The contribution of relativity to the Eiso is - ~1.33 eV. The optimized bond distances Sg-C and C-O for octahedral Sg(CO)6 using our DF (NR) calculations are 2.151 ( 2.318 and 1.119 ( 1.114 (ang}). The optimized six Sg-O and C-O bond distances for octahedral Sg(OC)6 at the DF level are equal to 4.897 and 1.108 {ang}. However, the optimized four Sg-O bond distances for the octahedral Sg(OC)6 at the NR level are 5.160 {ang} each, and two Sg-O bonds of 2.721 {ang} each, but all six C-O bonds are 1.108{ang} each. The energies at the DF level of theory for the reaction Sg+6CO to yield Sg (CO)6 and Sg(OC)6 are calculated as -7.30 and -2.80 eV. Moreover, the energies of the reaction at the DFBG level to yield Sg(CO)6 and Sg(OC)6 are very close to those predicted at the DF level of theory of -7.17 and -2.76 eV. However, the NR energies of the above-mentioned reaction are -6.99 and -1.15 eV. The mean bond energies predicted for Sg(CO)6 with our DF, DFBG, and NR calculations are 117.40 , 115.31, and 112.41 kJ/mol, whereas the mean bond energies calculated for the isomer Sg(OC)6 at DF, DFBG and NR levels are 45.03 ,44.39 and 18.49 kJ/mole. The predicted existence of both the isomers with Eiso of ~ 4.50 and ~ 5.80 eV, may cause problems for experimental identification of seaborgium hexacarbonyl.","(408, 13)","The isomerization of heavy atomic nuclei plays a crucial role in nuclear structure and decay studies. In this work, we investigate the relativistic and magnetic Breit effects for the isomerization of Sg(CO)6 and Sg(OC)6 complexes. The isomerization of these complexes is a complex process that results in a change in the structure and orientation of the molecules. We perform ab initio calculations based on the coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations, as well as perturbative triple excitations, using the scalar relativistic and spin-orbit effective core potentials. 

Our results show that the relativistic and magnetic Breit contributions have a significant effect on the isomerization energy barriers of both complexes. The relativistic contributions result in a reduction in the energy barriers by up to 10 kcal/mol, while the magnetic Breit contributions result in increases in the energy barriers by up to 15 kcal/mol. We also observe that the magnetic Breit contributions are more significant for Sg(CO)6 than for Sg(OC)6. 

We further investigate the changes in the molecular properties of these complexes due to the relativistic and magnetic Breit effects. Our analysis reveals significant changes in the molecular orbitals, electric dipole moments, and other molecular properties. We also observe that the magnetic Breit contributions significantly affect the bond angles and bond lengths in these complexes. 

Our study provides important insights into the isomerization process for these complexes and highlights the importance of relativistic and magnetic Breit effects in heavy atomic nuclei.

Methods. We assembled a sample of 217 LAE from the Vimos-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) with secure spectroscopic redshifts in the redshift range 2 < z < 6.62 and fluxes down to F=1.5x10^18 erg/s/cm^2. 133 LAE are serendipitous identifications in the 22 arcmin^2 total slit area surveyed with the VVDS-Deep and the 3.3 arcmin^2 from the VVDS Ultra-Deep survey, and 84 are targeted identifications in the 0.62 deg^2 surveyed with the VVDS-DEEP and 0.16 deg^2 from the Ultra-Deep survey. Among the serendipitous targets we estimate that 90% of the emission lines are most probably Ly-a, while the remaining 10% could be either [OII]3727 or Ly-a. We computed the LF and derived the SFRD from LAE at these redshifts.

Results. The VVDS-LAE sample reaches faint line fluxes F(Lya) = 1.5x1^18 erg/s/cm^2 (corresponding to L(Lya)=10^41 erg/s at z~3) enabling the faint end slope of the luminosity function to be constrained to a=-1.6+-0.12 at redshift z~2.5 and to a=-1.78+0.1-0.12 at z=4, placing on firm statistical grounds trends found in previous LAE studies, and indicating that sub-L* LAE contribute significantly to the SFRD. The projected number density and volume density of faint LAE in 2<z<6.6 with F>1.5x10^18 erg/s/cm^2 are 33 galaxies/arcmin^2 and 4x10^-2 Mpc^-3, respectively. We find that the the observed luminosity function of LAE does not evolve from z=2 to z=6. This implies that, after correction for the redshift-dependent IGM absorption, the intrinsic LF must have evolved significantly over 3 Gyr. The SFRD from LAE contributes to about 20% of the SFRD at z =2-3, while the LAE appear to be the dominant source of star formation producing ionizing photons in the early universe z>5-6, becoming equivalent to that of Lyman Break galaxies.","(365, 13)","In this paper, we present the results of the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey, which has been conducted to study the star formation rate (SFR) density of Lyα emitters in a sample of 217 galaxies with redshifts ranging from 2 to 6.6. The Lyα emission line is a powerful tracer of high-redshift star-forming galaxies, and its detection at these redshifts can provide crucial insights into the early universe. 

We used the VIMOS spectrograph mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) to obtain spectroscopic redshifts of these galaxies, and identified a total of 116 Lyα emitters in our sample. Using the Lyα and continuum fluxes, we estimated the SFR of these galaxies, and found that the SFR density increases rapidly with redshift, indicating a strong evolution of the star-forming population over cosmic time.

We also explored the dependence of SFR density on dark matter halo mass and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, and found that while there is a strong correlation between SFR density and halo mass, there is no clear correlation with UV luminosity. This suggests that the Lyα emission is tracing a different component of star formation in these galaxies compared to the UV continuum.

Finally, we compared our results with previous surveys of Lyα emitters at similar redshifts, and found that while there is some differences in the measured SFR densities, the overall evolution of the Lyα emitter population is in good agreement with previous observations. Our results provide further evidence for the importance of Lyα emission as a tool for studying the early universe, and pave the way for future surveys to probe even higher redshifts and fainter Lyα emitters.","(297, 8)","Aims. The aim of this work is to study the contribution of the Ly-a emitters  (LAEs) to the star formation rate density (SFRD) of the universe at redshifts z=2-6.6, using a large sample of 217 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs from the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS).

Methodology. The VVDS is a deep spectroscopic survey conducted with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) using the VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS). The survey covers a total area of 1.5 deg^2 in the CDFS (Chandra Deep Field South) and ECDFS (Extended CDFS) fields, reaching a median redshift of z=1.3. Our sample consists of 217 LAEs selected from the VVDS spectroscopic catalog, with redshifts ranging from z=2 to z=6.6. We use the [OII] emission line to estimate the star formation rates (SFRs) of the LAEs, assuming a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) and a dust extinction correction based on the Balmer decrement.

Results. We find that the LAEs contribute significantly to the SFRD of the universe at high redshifts, with a median SFR of log(M_sun/yr) = -1.5. The SFRD of LAEs increases with redshift, peaking at z=4.5 with a value of log(SFRD/M_sun/yr/Mpc^3) = -2.5. We also find a strong correlation between the SFR and the equivalent width (EW) of the Ly-a emission line, with higher EWs corresponding to higher SFRs.

Implications. Our results have important implications for our understanding of the early universe.

We prove that the fibration $\pi_{n,k} : C_{n}^G(S) \to C_k^G(S)$ obtained by projecting on the first $k$ coordinates is a rational fibration. As a consequence, the space $C_{n}^G(S)$ has a Sullivan model $A_{n,k}=\Lambda V_{C_k^G(S)}\otimes \Lambda V_{C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k})}$ fitting in a cdga sequence: $\Lambda V_{C_k^G(S)}\to A_{n,k} \to \Lambda V_{C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k})},$ where $\Lambda V_X$ denotes the minimal model of $X$, and $C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k})$ is the fiber of $\pi_{n,k}$. We show that this model is minimal except for some cases when $S\simeq S^2$ and compute in all the cases the higher $\psi$-homotopy groups (related to the generators of the minimal model) of $C_n^G(S)$. We deduce from the computation that $C_n^G(S)$ having finite Betti numbers is a rational $K(\pi,1)$, i.e its minimal model and $1$-minimal model are the same (or equivalently the $\psi$-homotopy space vanishes in degree grater then $2$), if and only if $S$ is not homeomorphic to $S^2$. In particular, for $S$ not homeomorphic to $S^2$, the minimal model (isomorphic to the $1$-minimal model) is entirely determined by the Malcev Lie algebra of $\pi_1 C_n^G(S)$. When $A_{n,k}$ is minimal, we get an exact sequence of Malcev Lie algebras $0\to L_{C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k})}\to L_{C_{n}^G(S)}\to L_{C_k^G(S)}\to 0$, where $L_X$ is the Malcev Lie algebra of $\pi_1X$. For $S \varsubsetneq \bar{S}=S^2$ and $G$ acting by orientation preserving homeomorphism, we prove that the cohomology ring of $C_n^G(S)$ is Koszul, and that for some of these spaces the minimal model can be obtained out of a Cartan-Chevally-Eilenberg construction applied to graded Lie algebra computed in an earlier work.","(546, 8)","This paper studies the models of orbit configuration spaces of surfaces by examining their geometric properties and analyzing their topological structures.

We also present important results on the deformation theory of orbit configuration spaces and their associated moduli spaces, which enable us to understand the space of solutions to important equations governing these spaces.

This paper addresses the problem of comparing minimal free resolutions of symbolic powers of an ","This paper addresses the problem of comparing minimal free resolutions of symbolic powers of an ideal. Our investigation is focused on the behavior of the function depth R/I^(t) = dim R - pd I^(t) - 1, where I^(t) denotes the t-th symbolic power of a homogeneous ideal I in a noetherian polynomial ring R and pd denotes the projective dimension.

It has been an open question whether the function depth R/I^(t) is non-increasing if I is a squarefree monomial ideal. We show that depth R/I^(t) is almost non-increasing in the sense that depth R/I^(s) \ge depth R/I^(t) for all s \ge 1 and t \in E(s), where E(s) = \cup_{i \ge 1} {t \in N| i(s-1)+1 \le t \le is} (which contains all integers t \ge (s-1)^2+1). The range E(s) is the best possible since we can find squarefree monomial ideals I such that depth R/I^(s) < depth R/I^(t) for t \not\in E(s), which gives a negative answer to the above question.

Another open question asks whether the function depth R/I^(t) is always constant for t \gg 0. We are able to construct counter-examples to this question by monomial ideals. On the other hand, we show that if I is a monomial ideal such that I^(t) is integrally closed for t \gg 0 (e.g. if I is a squarefree monomial ideal), then depth R/I^(t) is constant for t \gg 0 with lim_{t \to \infty} depth R/I^(t) = dim R - dim \oplus_{t \ge 0} I^(t)/m I^(t).

Our last result (which is the main contribution of this paper) shows that for any positive numerical function \phi(t) which is periodic for t \gg 0, there exist a polynomial ring R and a homogeneous ideal I such that depth R/I^(t) = \phi(t) for all t \ge 1. As a consequence, for any non-negative numerical function \psi(t) which is periodic for t \gg 0, there is a homogeneous ideal I and a number c such that pd I^(t) = \psi(t) + c for all t \ge 1.","(452, 11)","Homogeneous ideals and their symbolic powers are a major focus of algebraic geometry research, with numerous applications in fields ranging from statistics to combinatorics. One important invariant associated with these ideals is their depth function, which measures the rate at which the ideals become ""less deep"" as we add more variables. In this paper, we study the depth functions of symbolic powers of homogeneous ideals, providing a comprehensive analysis of their behavior and fundamental properties. Our main result is a complete classification of the possible depth functions for symbolic powers, which can take on a wide range of values and exhibit complex behaviors. One key insight we use to prove this result is the notion of maximal shifts, which allow us to obtain explicit formulas for the depth function of symbolic powers in many cases. We also explore connections between depth functions and other important invariants of symbolic powers, such as their Hilbert series and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. Through a series of examples and case studies, we demonstrate the power and versatility of our approach and provide a valuable toolkit for researchers working in algebraic geometry and related fields. Our results have numerous applications in algebraic statistics, coding theory, and commutative algebra, and we anticipate that they will inspire further research in these and other areas.

The data were analyzed by means of a simple analytical description of the general properties of molecular emission from the inner shells around the cool star. Numerical calculations of the expected line profiles, taking into account the level population and radiative transfer under such conditions, were also performed. Weak emission of 12CO J=2-1 and J=1-0 was detected in R Aqr and CH Cyg; a good line profile of 12CO J=2-1 in R Aqr was obtained. The intensities and profile shapes of the detected lines are compatible with emission coming from a very small shell around the Mira-type star, with a radius comparable to or slightly smaller than the distance to the hot dwarf companion, 10$^{14}$ - 2 10$^{14}$ cm. We argue that other possible explanations are improbable. This region probably shows properties similar to those characteristic of the inner shells around standard AGB stars: outwards expansion at about 5 - 25 km/s, with a significant acceleration of the gas, temperatures decreasing with radius between about 1000 and 500 K, and densities ~ 10$^9$ - 3 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Our model calculations are able to explain the asymmetric line shape observed in 12CO J=2-1 from R Aqr, in which the relatively weaker red part of the profile would result from selfabsorption by the outer layers (in the presence of a velocity increase and a temperature decrease with radius). The mass-loss rates are somewhat larger than in standard AGB stars, as often happens for symbiotic systems. In R Aqr, we find that the total mass of the CO emitting region is ~ 2 - 3 10$^{-5}$ Mo, corresponding to M' ~ 5 10$^{-6}$ - 10$^{-5}$ Mo/yr, and compatible with results obtained from dust emission. Taking into account other existing data on molecular emission, we suggest that the small extent of the molecule-rich gas in symbiotic systems is mainly due to molecule photodissociation by the radiation of the hot dwarf star.","(427, 11)","Symbiotic stellar systems are close binary star systems, in which a white dwarf accretes material from its red giant companion via a stellar wind. The interaction between these two stars leads to a variety of physical phenomena, including outflows of ionized gas, shocks, and X-ray emission. In recent years, there has been growing interest in studying these systems using carbon monoxide (CO) observations.

CO is an excellent tracer of the molecular gas in these systems and is sensitive to a wide range of physical conditions, such as temperature and density. By observing the CO emission from symbiotic stars, we can study the structure and dynamics of the surrounding gas, as well as the physical processes that drive its behavior.

In this paper, we present new CO observations of a sample of symbiotic stellar systems using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). Our sample includes a variety of systems with different properties, such as the presence of jets, shocks, and outflows. With our data, we are able to study the kinematics and morphology of the CO emission, as well as its relation to other observables, such as X-rays and optical emission lines.

Our results show that CO is a powerful diagnostic tool for studying the physical conditions in symbiotic stellar systems. We find evidence for gas with a range of temperatures and densities, as well as a variety of kinematic and morphological structures. In particular, we observe a number of cases where the CO emission is associated with outflows and shocks, suggesting that these systems are undergoing significant dynamic activity.

Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of CO observations for improving our understanding of symbiotic stellar systems and their physical properties. We discuss the implications of our findings for future observational and theoretical studies of these systems, and highlight the role of ALMA and other instruments in advancing this field of research.","(348, 13)","We have performed mm-wave observations with the IRAM 30m telescope of the 12CO J=2-1 and 3-2 transitions towards a sample of symbiotic binary systems (SBSs).

We aimed to investigate the CO emission properties of these systems, which can provide insights into the mass loss mechanisms and the interaction between the WD and RG. The observations were carried out in dual-beam mode, allowing us to simultaneously observe the 12CO lines and the continuum emission.

The data were reduced using the GILDAS software package, and the resulting spectra were analyzed to extract the line fluxes, widths, and profiles. We detected CO emission in 12 out of the 15 observed SBSs, with the remaining three systems showing upper limits on the CO flux. The CO emission was found to be variable in some systems, with changes in the line flux and profile occurring on timescales of months to years.

Our results show that the CO emission in SBSs is often characterized by a double-peaked profile, indicating the presence of a circumbinary disk. The disk is thought to form as a result of the mass transfer from the RG to the WD, with the CO emission arising from the outer regions of the disk. We also find that the CO emission is often blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity, suggesting the presence of outflows or winds in the system.

The implications of our findings are far-reaching, as they provide new insights into the complex physics of SBSs. The detection of CO emission in these systems allows us to constrain models of mass loss and accretion, which are crucial for understanding the evolution of these systems. Furthermore, the variability of the CO emission provides a new tool for monitoring the activity of SBSs, which can be used to study the long-term evolution of these systems.

Our results also have implications for the study of other types of binary systems, such as cataclysmic variables and low-mass X-ray binaries. The CO emission observed in SBSs may be indicative of a more general phenomenon, where mass transfer and accretion lead to the formation of circumbinary disks and outflows.

We have analysed 18 ALMA continuum maps in Bands 6 and 7, with rms down ","We have analysed 18 ALMA continuum maps in Bands 6 and 7, with rms down to 7.8$\mu$Jy, to derive differential number counts down to 60$\mu$Jy and 100$\mu$Jy at $\lambda=$1.3 mm and $\lambda=$1.1 mm, respectively. The area covered by the combined fields is $\rm 9.5\times10^{-4}deg^2$ at 1.1mm and $\rm 6.6\times10^{-4}deg^{2}$ at 1.3mm. We improved the source extraction method by requiring that the dimension of the detected sources be consistent with the beam size. This method enabled us to remove spurious detections that have plagued the purity of the catalogues in previous studies. We detected 50 faint sources with S/N$>$3.5 down to 60$\mu$Jy, hence improving the statistics by a factor of four relative to previous studies. The inferred differential number counts are $\rm dN/d(Log_{10}S)=1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.1 mm flux $S_{\lambda = 1.1~mm} = 130~\mu$Jy, and $\rm dN/d(Log_{10}S)=1.1\times10^5~deg^2$ at a 1.3 mm flux $\rm S_{\lambda = 1.3~mm} = 60~\mu$Jy. At the faintest flux limits, i.e. 30$\mu$Jy and 40$\mu$Jy, we obtain upper limits on the differential number counts of $\rm dN/d(Log_{10}S) < 7\times10^5~deg^2$ and $\rm dN/d(Log_{10}S)<3\times10^5~deg^2$, respectively. Our results provide a new lower limit to CIB intensity of 17.2${\rm Jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.1mm and of 12.9${\rm Jy\ deg^{-2}}$ at 1.3mm. Moreover, the flattening of the integrated number counts at faint fluxes strongly suggests that we are probably close to the CIB intensity. Our data imply that galaxies with SFR$<40~M_{\odot}/yr$ certainly contribute less than 50% to the CIB while more than 50% of the CIB must be produced by galaxies with $\rm SFR>40~M_{\odot}/yr$. The differential number counts are in nice agreement with recent semi-analytical models of galaxy formation even as low as our faint fluxes. Consequently, this supports the galaxy evolutionary scenarios and assumptions made in these models.","(441, 13)","This paper reports on new measurements of the faint millimetre source number counts, obtained by extrapolating counts measured by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at brighter flux densities. The resulting counts, in the range of 0.5 to 2 mJy, are compared to model predictions and previous measurements, and are found to be consistent with both, although the uncertainties remain significant. The paper then investigates the contribution of these faint sources to the cosmic infrared background (CIB), which is the integrated emission of all extragalactic sources at infrared wavelengths. By combining the counts with constraints from other surveys, the fraction of the CIB resolved by ALMA is estimated to be between 6 and 14 percent at the ALMA frequencies of 100 to 850 GHz, depending on the model assumptions. This is a significant fraction of the CIB, given that ALMA surveys cover only a small fraction of the sky. The paper discusses the implications of these results for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, and for future observations of the CIB with ALMA and other telescopes. The authors conclude that the abundance and properties of faint millimetre sources are important probes of the physical processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution, and that further progress in this field will require larger surveys with higher sensitivity and resolution, as well as deeper multi-wavelength observations to constrain the properties of the host galaxies and their environments. In particular, the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are expected to provide complementary insights into the nature and evolution of these sources and their impact on the CIB.","(299, 8)","We have analysed 18 ALMA continuum maps in Bands 6 and 7, with rms down 0.5 mJy/beam, to constrain the faint end of the millimetre number counts.

The flow of liquid metal inside the Earth's core produces the geomagnetic field and its ","The flow of liquid metal inside the Earth's core produces the geomagnetic field and its time variations. Understanding the variability of those deep currents is crucial to improve the forecast of geomagnetic field variations, which affect human spacial and aeronautic activities. Moreover, it may provide relevant information on the core dynamics. The main goal of this study is to extract and characterize the leading variability modes of core flows over centennial periods, and to assess their statistical robustness. To this end, we use flows that we invert from two geomagnetic field models (gufm1 and COV-OBS), and apply Principal Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition of coupled fields. The quasi geostrophic (QG) flows inverted from both geomagnetic field models show similar features. However, COV-OBS has a less energetic mean and larger time variability. The statistical significance of flow components is tested from analyses performed on subareas of the whole domain. Bootstrapping methods are also used to extract significant flow features required by both gufm1 and COV-OBS. Three main empirical circulation modes emerge, simultaneously constrained by both geomagnetic field models and expected to be robust against the particular a priori used to build them (large scale QG dynamics). Mode 1 exhibits three large vortices at medium/high latitudes, with opposite circulation under the Atlantic and the Pacific hemispheres. Mode 2 interestingly accounts for most of the variations of the Earth's core angular momentum. In this mode, the regions close to the tangent cylinder and to the equator are correlated, and oscillate with a period between 80 and 90 years.

Each of these two modes is energetic enough to alter the mean flow, sometimes reinforcing the eccentric gyre, and other times breaking it up into smaller circulations. The three main circulation modes added together to the mean flow account for about 70% of the flows variability, 90% of the root mean square total velocities, and 95% of the secular variation induced by the total flows.

Direct physical interpretation of the computed modes is not straightforward.

Nonethe-less, similarities found between the two first modes and time/spatial features identified in different studies of core dynamics, suggest that our approach can help to pinpoint the relevant physical processes inside the core on centennial timescales.","(411, 17)","The Earth's magnetic field is a complex and dynamic system that is driven by fluid motion in the Earth's core. In recent years, advances in satellite-based observations and computational techniques have led to improved models of the geomagnetic field, which provide valuable insights into the core dynamics that generate the field. In particular, these models can be used to infer the patterns and variability of fluid motion in the core, which are important for understanding the mechanisms that produce the Earth's magnetic field.

One approach to analyzing and interpreting geomagnetic field models is to use inversion techniques to infer the flow patterns in the core that are consistent with the observed magnetic field. This involves solving a set of equations that relate the magnetic field to the fluid motion in the core, and then using these solutions to generate maps of the flow patterns. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in characterizing the different types of flow variability that are observed in these maps, and understanding the physical processes that give rise to them.

One important type of flow variability is known as ""variability modes,"" which are fluctuations in the core flow that exhibit coherent patterns over different length and time scales. These modes are thought to be driven by interactions between the fluid motion and the Earth's rotation, and have been observed in a number of different geomagnetic field models. However, the physical mechanisms that produce these modes are not yet fully understood, and there is ongoing research to develop more accurate models that can capture their dynamics.

Overall, the study of variability modes in core flows inverted from geomagnetic field models is an active area of research that has important implications for our understanding of the Earth's magnetic field. By characterizing the patterns and dynamics of flow variability in the core, we can gain insights into the physical processes that drive the Earth's magnetic field, as well as the broader geophysical processes that are responsible for shaping the Earth's surface and interior. As computational and observational technologies continue to improve, it is likely that we will gain a more nuanced and detailed understanding of these complex systems in the years to come.","(402, 12)","The flow of liquid metal inside the Earth's core produces the geomagnetic field and its 11-year solar cycle variations. However, the dynamics of the core flow remain poorly understood due to the lack of direct observations. Geomagnetic field models have been widely used to infer the core flow patterns, but the variability modes in these flows have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by analyzing the core flow patterns inverted from various geomagnetic field models.

We employed a range of geomagnetic field models, including the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF), the World Magnetic Model (WMM), and the CHAOS model, to derive the core flow patterns. These models provide different representations of the geomagnetic field, allowing us to investigate the variability modes in the core flows. We used a spherical harmonic analysis to decompose the core flow patterns into their spatial and temporal components. This enabled us to identify the dominant variability modes and their corresponding frequencies.

Our results show that the core flow patterns exhibit significant variability on timescales ranging from a few years to several decades. The IGRF model reveals a dominant variability mode with a period of approximately 10 years, which is consistent with the solar cycle. In contrast, the WMM model shows a more complex variability pattern with multiple modes having periods of 5-15 years. The CHAOS model exhibits a mix of both patterns, indicating that the core flow dynamics are more complex than previously thought. We also found that the variability modes are not limited to the radial component of the flow but are also present in the azimuthal and meridional components.

The implications of our findings are significant for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's core. The observed variability modes suggest that the core flow is not a steady-state process but rather a dynamic system that responds to changes in the solar wind and the Earth's mantle. This has important implications for our understanding of the geodynamo process, which generates the geomagnetic field. Furthermore, the variability modes identified in this study can be used to improve the accuracy of geomagnetic field predictions and to better understand the long-term evolution of the Earth's magnetic field.

Our results also highlight the importance of using multiple geomagnetic field models to derive core flow patterns. By combining the strengths of different models, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the core flow dynamics.

Mammography is a specific type of breast imaging that uses low-dose X-rays to detect cancer ","Mammography is a specific type of breast imaging that uses low-dose X-rays to detect cancer in early stage. During the exam, the women breast is compressed between two plates until a nearly uniform breast thickness is obtained. This technique improves image quality and reduces dose but can also be the source of discomfort and sometimes pain for the patient. Therefore, alternative techniques allowing reduced breast compression is of potential interest. The aim of this work is to develop a 3D biomechanical Finite Element (FE) breast model in order to analyze various breast compression strategies and their impact on image quality and radiation dose. Large breast deformations are simulated using this FE model with ANSYS software. A particular attention is granted to the computation of the residual stress in the model due to gravity and boundary conditions (thorax anatomy, position of the patient inside the MRI machine). Previously developed biomechanical breast models use a simplified breast anatomy by modeling adipose and fibroglandular tissues only (Rajagopal et al. in Wiley Interdiscip Rev: Syst Biol Med 2:293--304, 2010). However, breast reconstruction surgery has proven the importance of suspensory ligaments and breast fasciae on breast mechanics (Lockwood in Plast Reconstr Surg 103:1411--1420, 1999). We are therefore consider using a more realistic breast anatomy by including skin, muscles, and suspensory ligaments. The breast tissues are modeled as neo-Hookean materials. A physical correct modeling of the breast requires the knowledge of the stress-free breast configuration.

Here, this undeformed shape (i.e., without any residual stress) is computed using the prediction--correction iterative scheme proposed by Eiben et al. (Ann of Biomed Eng 44:154--173, 2016). The unloading procedure uses the breast configuration in prone and supine position in order to find a unique displacement vector field induced by gravitational forces. The 3D breast geometry is reconstructed from MRI images that are segmented (Yushkevich et al.

in Neuroimage 31:1116--1128, 2006) to differentiate the four main tissue types.

The breast volume is discretized with a hexa-dominant FE meshing tool as a unique volume. Finally, the model is evaluated by comparing the estimated breast deformations under gravity load with the experimental ones measured in three body positions: prone, supine, and oblique supine.","(421, 20)","Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has shown promising results in the detection of breast cancer. However, the level of compression used during image acquisition plays a critical role in image quality and radiation dose. Therefore, optimizing the level of compression is essential for achieving accurate diagnosis with minimal radiation exposure. In this study, we propose a breast biomechanical model to optimize compression in DBT.

The model is derived from finite element analysis of breast tissue, taking into consideration the heterogeneous nature of breast tissue and its mechanical properties. We incorporated the model into a digital phantom that mimics clinical images obtained using DBT. We used this phantom to simulate variations in compression levels and study their effects on image quality and radiation dose.

Our results show that by altering the level of compression, we can improve image quality without compromising on the radiation dose. The biomechanical model provided a means of predicting changes in breast tissue deformation as a result of compression. It allowed us to simulate the effects of different compression levels on image appearance and quality, and determine the optimal compression for DBT.

Our proposed method has a potential to improve the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis while also reducing radiation exposure. By incorporating our model into clinical practice, it may lead to more efficient and effective DBT mammography. Additionally, our biomechanical model may also have broader applications in other areas of medical imaging.

In conclusion, this study provides a novel approach to optimize compression levels in DBT using a biomechanical model. Our results demonstrate that our method can improve image quality while maintaining minimum radiation exposure. Future studies should focus on validating our model in clinical settings.","(306, 16)","Mammography is a specific type of breast imaging that uses low-dose X-rays to detect cancer  in its early stages. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), also known as three-dimensional (3D) mammography, is an advanced form of mammography that has gained popularity in recent years due to its improved sensitivity and specificity in detecting breast cancer compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) mammography. However, one of the major limitations of DBT is the discomfort and pain experienced by patients during the examination, particularly those with denser breast tissue. This discomfort is largely attributed to the compression force applied to the breast during the examination, which can be uncomfortable and even painful for some patients.

To address this issue, our research focused on developing a biomechanical model of the breast to optimize compression in DBT. The primary objective of this study was to create a computational model that could simulate the mechanical behavior of the breast under various compression forces, allowing us to identify the optimal compression force that minimizes patient discomfort while maintaining image quality. To achieve this, we employed a combination of finite element analysis (FEA) and machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model of breast deformation under compression.

Our methodology involved several key steps. First, we conducted a thorough review of existing literature on breast biomechanics and DBT to identify the most relevant parameters that influence breast deformation under compression. These parameters included breast density, age, and compression force. We then used FEA to create a 3D computational model of the breast, which was validated against experimental data from previous studies. Next, we used machine learning algorithms to train the model on a large dataset of simulated breast deformations under various compression forces. The trained model was then used to predict the optimal compression force for each patient based on their individual breast characteristics.

The results of our study showed that the developed biomechanical model was highly accurate in predicting breast deformation under compression, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95 between predicted and experimental data. Furthermore, the model revealed that the optimal compression force varied significantly between patients, depending on their breast density and age. For example, patients with dense breast tissue required lower compression forces to achieve optimal image quality, while patients with fatty breast tissue required higher compression forces. These findings have significant implications for the development of personalized DBT protocols that take into account individual patient characteristics.

The implications of our study are far-reaching and have the potential to improve the patient experience during DBT examinations. By optimizing compression forces based on individual patient characteristics, healthcare providers can reduce patient discomfort and pain, leading to increased patient satisfaction and adherence to recommended screening protocols.

We denote by Q_F the family of the Alexander quandle structures supported by finite fields. ","We denote by Q_F the family of the Alexander quandle structures supported by finite fields. For every k-component oriented link L, every partition P of L into h:=|P| sublinks, and every labelling z of such a partition by the natural numbers z_1,...,z_n, the number of X-colorings of any diagram of (L,z) is a well-defined invariant of (L,P), of the form q^(a_X(L,P,z)+1) for some natural number a_X(L,P,z). Letting X and z vary in Q_F and among the labellings of P, we define a derived invariant A_Q(L,P)=sup a_X(L,P,z).

If P_M is such that |P_M|=k, we show that A_Q(L,P_M) is a lower bound for t(L), where t(L) is the tunnel number of L. If P is a ""boundary partition"" of L and g(L,P) denotes the infimum among the sums of the genera of a system of disjoint Seifert surfaces for the L_j's, then we show that A_Q(L,P) is at most 2g(L,P)+2k-|P|-1. We set A_Q(L):=A_Q(L,P_m), where |P_m|=1. By elaborating on a suitable version of a result by Inoue, we show that when L=K is a knot then A_Q(K) is bounded above by A(K), where A(K) is the breadth of the Alexander polynomial of K. However, for every g we exhibit examples of genus-g knots having the same Alexander polynomial but different quandle invariants A_Q.

Moreover, in such examples A_Q provides sharp lower bounds for the genera of the knots. On the other hand, A_Q(L) can give better lower bounds on the genus than A(L), when L has at least two components.

We show that in order to compute A_Q(L) it is enough to consider only colorings with respect to the constant labelling z=1. In the case when L=K is a knot, if either A_Q(K)=A(K) or A_Q(K) provides a sharp lower bound for the knot genus, or if A_Q(K)=1, then A_Q(K) can be realized by means of the proper subfamily of quandles X=(F_p,*), where p varies among the odd prime numbers.","(470, 10)","This paper investigates the lower bounds for link genera in the context of Alexander quandles. We begin by providing a brief overview of the relevant concepts in quandle theory and algebraic topology. Specifically, we focus on the Alexander module associated with a quandle, which is a powerful tool for studying the topology of links and knots. 

Building on this foundation, we then introduce the notion of link genera, which measures the complexity of a link and is closely related to its unknotting number. We demonstrate that the Alexander quandle of a link is intimately related to its genus, providing a natural framework for investigating lower bounds on the latter. 

Our main result is a theorem which establishes a lower bound for the genus of a link in terms of the ranks of certain submodules of its associated Alexander module. We describe the proof of this result in detail, showcasing the utility of a variety of algebraic techniques in quandle theory and topology to obtain the desired bound. 

We then proceed to apply our result to various examples of links and knots, illustrating the effectiveness of our approach in establishing lower bounds for their genera. In particular, we consider the specific case of the trefoil knot and provide a detailed analysis of its Alexander quandle and associated module. 

Finally, we discuss future directions for this research, including the potential for using our techniques to investigate upper bounds for link genera. We also highlight the broader implications of our work for the study of quandle theory and algebraic topology more generally, showcasing the potential for further advances in these exciting areas of mathematics. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights and techniques for researchers and mathematicians interested in the behavior of links and knots in higher dimensions.","(318, 12)","We denote by Q_F the family of the Alexander quandle structures supported by finite fields.  In this paper, we investigate the lower bounds for the genera of links in terms of the complexity of their Alexander quandle structures.  Specifically, we aim to establish a relationship between the genus of a link and the minimal number of generators required to present its Alexander quandle structure as a quotient of a free quandle by a normal subgroup.  To achieve this goal, we employ a combination of techniques from algebraic topology, quandle theory, and combinatorial group theory.

Our investigation begins with a review of the fundamental concepts in quandle theory, including the definition of a quandle, its properties, and the notion of a quandle structure supported by a finite field.  We then introduce the Alexander quandle structure, which is a specific type of quandle structure that arises from the Alexander polynomial of a link.  The Alexander polynomial is a topological invariant of a link that encodes information about its knotting and linking properties.  We show that the complexity of an Alexander quandle structure is closely related to the degree of the Alexander polynomial, which in turn is related to the genus of the link.

Using a combination of algebraic and combinatorial techniques, we establish a lower bound for the genus of a linked in terms of the minimal number of generator required to present its associated Alexander quandle structure.  This lower bound is expressed in terms of a new invariant, which we call the ""quandle genus"" of the link.  The quandle genus is a measure of the complexity of the quandle structure, and it is defined in terms of the number of generators and relations required to present the quandle.

We also investigate the relationship between the quandle genus and other known invariants of links, such as the Jones polynomial and the HOMFLY polynomial.  Our results show that the quandle genus is closely related to these invariants, and we establish a series of inequalities that relate the quandle genus to these invariants.  These inequalities provide a new perspective on the relationship between the topological and algebraic properties of links.

Our findings have significant implications for the study of link invariants and the classification of links.  They provide a new tool for distinguishing between links with different genera, and they shed new light on the relationships between different link invariants.  Furthermore, our results have potential applications in computer science, where they can be used to develop more efficient algorithms for computing link invariants and classifying links.
