This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes
","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes equations. The thesis is divided in four independent chapters.The first chapter involves a rigorous discussion about the energy's dissipation law, proposed by theory of the turbulence K41, in the deterministic setting of the homogeneous and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with a stationary external force (the force only depends of the spatial variable) and on the whole space R3. The energy's dissipation law, also called the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, characterizes the energy's dissipation rate (in the form of heat) of a turbulent fluid and this law was developed by A.N.

Kolmogorov in 1941. However, its deduction (which uses mainly tools of statistics) is not fully understood until our days and then an active research area consists in studying this law in the rigorous framework of the Navier-Stokes equations which describe in a mathematical way the fluids motion and in particular the movement of turbulent fluids. In this setting, the purpose of this chapter is to highlight the fact that if we consider the Navier-Stokes equations on R3 then certain physical quantities, necessary for the study of the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, have no a rigorous definition and then to give a sense to these quantities we suggest to consider the Navier-Stokes equations with an additional damping term. In the framework of these damped equations, we obtain some estimates for the energy's dissipation rate according to the Kolmogorov's dissipation law.In the second chapter we are interested in study the stationary solutions of the damped Navier- Stokes introduced in the previous chapter. These stationary solutions are a particular type of solutions which do not depend of the temporal variable and their study is motivated by the fact that we always consider the Navier-Stokes equations with a stationary external force. In this chapter we study two properties of the stationary solutions : the first property concerns the stability of these solutions where we prove that if we have a control on the external force then all non stationary solution (with depends of both spatial and temporal variables) converges toward a stationary solution. The second property concerns the decay in spatial variable of the stationary solutions. These properties of stationary solutions are a consequence of the damping term introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations.In the third chapter we still study the stationary solutions of Navier-Stokes equations but now we consider the classical equations (without any additional damping term). The purpose of this chapter is to study an other problem related to the deterministic description of the turbulence : the frequency decay of the stationary solutions. Indeed, according to the K41 theory, if the fluid is in a laminar setting then the stationary solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations must exhibit a exponential frequency decay which starts at lows frequencies. But, if the fluid is in a turbulent setting then this exponential frequency decay must be observed only at highs frequencies. In this chapter, using some Fourier analysis tools, we give a precise description of this exponential frequency decay in the laminar and in the turbulent setting.In the fourth and last chapter we return to the stationary solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations and we study the uniqueness of these solutions in the particular case without any external force. Following some ideas of G. Seregin, we study the uniqueness of these solutions first in the framework of Lebesgue spaces of and then in the a general framework of Morrey spaces.","(624, 16)","The Navier-Stokes equations provide a fundamental framework for understanding the behavior of fluids in a wide range of applications. One phenomenon that is crucial to explaining such behavior is the turbulence that fluids exhibit. Turbulence is a complex, dynamic process that has resisted detailed analytical investigation due to its highly nonlinear nature. Instead, researchers often rely on numerical simulations, which in turn demand accurate and efficient models for describing turbulence. 

This paper presents a thorough overview of deterministic descriptions of turbulence within the realm of Navier-Stokes equations. By focusing on the use of deterministic models, we aim to better understand the nature of turbulence, how it arises, and how it can be controlled or harnessed for practical purposes. The need for such models is pressing, as they can be used to improve the design of fluid-based technologies, such as naval vessels, aircraft, and wind turbines, among others.

The main body of the paper is divided into several sections that cover different aspects of deterministic descriptions of turbulence. The first section introduces the Navier-Stokes equations and provides a brief overview of their solution. The second section then delves into deterministic models of turbulence, starting with a basic introduction to the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence and moving on to more advanced models. In particular, we investigate models based on the concepts of eddies and energy cascades, as well as models that use multiscale approaches to capture the range of phenomena that turbulence can exhibit.

In the third section of the paper, we turn our attention to numerical simulations of turbulence. We describe the use of high-performance computing and sophisticated algorithms to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, while titrating the advantages and limitations of various numerical methods. We then proceed to describe how deterministic descriptions of turbulence can be integrated into numerical simulations for optimal performance and predictive capabilities. 

The final section of the paper discusses some of the key challenges facing the field in the coming years. These include the need for more efficient and accurate models, the development of novel simulation techniques, and the integration of experimental data to improve model prediction. We conclude by highlighting some of the potential applications of deterministic models of turbulence to industrial processes, environmental studies, and even astrophysics.

Overall, this paper presents an in-depth review of deterministic descriptions of turbulence in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the nature of turbulence and the tools necessary to control it. It is our hope that this work will help to shape future research in this important and challenging area of physics.","(489, 20)","This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the Navier- Stokes

","Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology. Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of multivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular, the diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite naturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum Parsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the analyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve the major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their discretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an unsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction How do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform themselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to present-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout the Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between these, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract some digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is classification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From images obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his observations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter (the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four categories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the famous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these classes, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been refined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global classification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by Hubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used to represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the Hubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can be understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations found between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one must admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble classification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the most obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate, qualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to characterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant multivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since the year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble classification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble classification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet emerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate analyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling the observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar clusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant objects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our present day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.

Astrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in astrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum Parsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new exploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \& Fraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a larger number of objects must now be analysed. In this paper, I","(680, 35)","Clustering is a widely used technique in astrophysics to study celestial objects and their properties. However, traditional clustering approaches often fall short in properly accounting for the complex evolutionary relationships between objects, especially those involving large-scale astrophysical phenomena. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the use of phylogenetic tools in clustering analyses in order to better understand the underlying evolutionary processes governing celestial objects in astrophysical systems.

We begin by introducing the fundamentals of phylogenetics and how it can be applied to astrophysics. We describe the concept of a ""phylogenetic tree"" which captures the hypothesized evolutionary relationships between celestial objects based on their observable traits and characteristics. By constructing these phylogenetic trees, we can gain insights into the evolutionary processes that govern these objects and how they may have evolved over time.

We then discuss how these phylogenetic tools can be incorporated into clustering analyses. We introduce a novel method for constructing phylogenetic distance matrices, which can be used as input into traditional clustering algorithms. By utilizing these distance matrices, we can cluster celestial objects based not only on their observable traits, but also on their evolutionary relationships, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical systems.

We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study of a large-scale simulation of galaxy formation and evolution. We show that the use of phylogenetic-based clustering leads to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history of galaxies within the simulation. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be used to identify ""outlier"" objects that may have unique evolutionary histories or properties.

Finally, we discuss the potential applications of phylogenetic-based clustering in future astrophysical research. We highlight the usefulness of this approach in studying diverse astrophysical systems, including stars, planets, and even entire galaxies. We also propose potential extensions to our method, such as incorporating additional sources of data or refining the phylogenetic analyses themselves.

In conclusion, this paper showcases the power of using phylogenetic tools in clustering analyses within astrophysics. By accounting for the complex evolutionary relationships between celestial objects, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of these astrophysical systems and their properties. We hope that this paper serves as a starting point for future research into the application of phylogenetics within astrophysics and beyond.","(417, 18)","Phylogenetic approaches are finding more and more applications outside the field of biology.

Phylogenetic trees are graphical representations of evolutionary relationships between organisms. They are
constructed by comparing the DNA or protein sequences of different organisms and inferring the evolutionary
relationships based on the similarities and differences in these sequences. Phylogenetic trees can be used for
clustering because they provide a natural way to group together organisms that are more closely related to each
other than to other organisms.
In our case study, we used phylogenetic trees to cluster galaxies based on their stellar masses, star formation
rates, and metallicities. We found that galaxies with similar physical properties tend to cluster together in the
phylogenetic tree. For example, galaxies with high stellar masses and low star formation rates tend to cluster
together in one branch of the tree, while galaxies with low stellar masses and high star formation rates tend
to cluster together in another branch of the tree. These results suggest that phylogenetic methods can be used
to identify groups of galaxies with similar physical characteristics.

deeper understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe. For example, we can use phylogenetic
methods to study the formation and evolution of galaxies, as well as the distribution of dark matter in the
universe. Additionally, phylogenetic methods may also be useful for studying other phenomena in astrophysics,
such as the formation of black holes and the origin of life.

","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the value of the statistic statistically significant or nonsignificant on the bases of a P value derived from a null-hypothesis test.

Taking into account that studies are manly conducted in sample, the use of null hypothesis testing only allows estimating the true values (population) of the statistics used. However, evidence has grown in many areas of knowledge that this approach often leads to confusion and misinterpretation. To overcome this limitation they have recently emerged recommendations to support the statistical analysis with approaches that make use of more intuitive interpretations and more practical, especially based on the magnitudes (certainty / uncertainty) of the true values found. With the intent to provide alternative solutions to methodological designs recurrently used in research in sports sciences, this paper will seek to i) briefly spell out some of the weaknesses associated with the null hypothesis tests based in the P value; ii) reflect on the implications of the use of practical/clinical significance as opposed to statistical significance; iii) submit proposals for use the inferences based on the magnitude, particularly in the visualization and interpretation of results; iv) present and discuss the limitations of magnitude-based inference. Thus, this update article discourages, in a sustained-based, the use of significance tests based only on the concept of null hypothesis. Alternatively, it is proposed to use methods of inference based on magnitudes as they allow interpretations of the practical/clinical effects results obtained.","(274, 7)","The use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) has been widely criticized in the field of sports science, leading to the call for alternative statistical methods that can offer better insight into the magnitude of effects. Inferential statistics based on magnitude-based inferences (MBI) have emerged as a promising alternative to NHST for investigating sports-related research questions.

MBI offers the possibility of quantifying the magnitude of differences between groups or treatments, rather than simply testing for statistically significant differences. This approach provides researchers with a more meaningful interpretation of their results and can ultimately lead to more informed conclusions that are relevant to practitioners and athletes alike.

The need to move away from NHST is not only due to its limitations in providing meaningful results, but also because of its reliance on arbitrary thresholds (e.g., a p-value of 0.05) that do not necessarily reflect the strength and importance of the observed effects. In contrast, MBI uses a statistical approach that is based on the estimation of effect sizes and their confidence intervals, enabling a more nuanced interpretation of the findings. 

Moreover, MBI can also mitigate problems associated with small sample sizes, which are common in sports science research. By focusing on effect size rather than the p-value, MBI can provide more stable and reliable estimates of the true population effect, even when working with small sample sizes.

MBI also offers advantages over other approaches, such as Bayesian statistics, in terms of its simplicity, ease of interpretation, and its potential to improve scientific communication. By adopting MBI, researchers and practitioners in sports science can overcome some of the limitations of NHST and obtain more meaningful and informative results.

In conclusion, the use of MBI in the investigation of sports-related research questions is becoming increasingly popular. MBI offers a more meaningful and informative approach to statistical inference, which can ultimately lead to more informed conclusions and practical implications for athletes and practitioners. The scientific community should continue to embrace and explore the potential of MBI as a valuable alternative to NHST in sports science research.","(378, 13)","Research in Sports Sciences is supported often by inferences based on the declaration of the

The dimension of $\poset$, $\dim(\poset)$ is the minimum integer $t$ such that $P$ can be expressed as the intersection of $t$ total orders. Let $G_\poset$ be the \emph{underlying comparability graph} of $\poset$, i.e. $S$ is the vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are comparable in $\poset$. It is a well-known fact that posets with the same underlying comparability graph have the same dimension. The first result of this paper links the dimension of a poset to the boxicity of its underlying comparability graph. In particular, we show that for any poset $\poset$, $\boxi(G_\poset)/(\chi(G_\poset)-1) \le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$, where $\chi(G_\poset)$ is the chromatic number of $G_\poset$ and $\chi(G_\poset)\ne1$. It immediately follows that if $\poset$ is a height-2 poset, then $\boxi(G_\poset)\le \dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ since the underlying comparability graph of a height-2 poset is a bipartite graph. The second result of the paper relates the boxicity of a graph $G$ with a natural partial order associated with the \emph{extended double cover} of $G$, denoted as $G_c$: Note that $G_c$ is a bipartite graph with partite sets $A$ and $B$ which are copies of $V(G)$ such that corresponding to every $u\in V(G)$, there are two vertices $u_A\in A$ and $u_B\in B$ and $\{u_A,v_B\}$ is an edge in $G_c$ if and only if either $u=v$ or $u$ is adjacent to $v$ in $G$. Let $\poset_c$ be the natural height-2 poset associated with $G_c$ by making $A$ the set of minimal elements and $B$ the set of maximal elements. We show that $\frac{\boxi(G)}{2} \le \dim(\poset_c) \le 2\boxi(G)+4$. These results have some immediate and significant consequences. The upper bound $\dim(\poset)\le 2\boxi(G_\poset)$ allows us to derive hitherto unknown upper bounds for poset dimension such as $\dim(\poset)\le 2\tw(G_\poset)+4$, since boxicity of any graph is known to be at most its $\tw+2$. In the other direction, using the already known bounds for partial order dimension we get the following: (1) The boxicity of any graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ is $O(\Delta\log^2\Delta)$ which is an improvement over the best known upper bound of $\Delta^2+2$. (2) There exist graphs with boxicity $\Omega(\Delta\log\Delta)$. This disproves a conjecture that the boxicity of a graph is $O(\Delta)$. (3) There exists no polynomial-time algorithm to approximate the boxicity of a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with a factor of $O(n^{0.5-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$, unless $NP=ZPP$.","(798, 21)","Boxicity and Poset Dimension are two closely related concepts in combinatorial optimization that have recently received extensive attention. Boxicity refers to the smallest integer k such that a graph can be represented as the intersection graph of k-dimensional axis-aligned boxes. Poset Dimension, on the other hand, measures the smallest number of linear extensions required to represent a partially ordered set (poset). While seemingly distinct, recent research has shown that these two concepts are closely related, and understanding one can give insight into the other.

The study of these two concepts has important practical applications in fields such as scheduling, logistics, and VLSI layout design. For example, in scheduling applications, boxicity can be used to construct scheduling models based on resource constraints where the resources have different capacities. These models are used in a variety of industries, such as manufacturing and transportation, to optimize the use of resources and increase efficiency.

In the past few decades, much research has been devoted to the algorithmic aspects of Boxicity and Poset Dimension. Algorithms have been developed to compute the boxicity and the poset dimension of a given graph, which have found applications in data analysis and optimization. Additionally, several linear time algorithms have been developed to compute the poset dimension of certain classes of posets such as grid posets.

Despite these algorithmic advances, there are still many open problems related to Boxicity and Poset Dimension. One such problem is determining the relationship between these two concepts for specific classes of graphs. Another open problem is determining the computational complexity of the poset dimension problem for certain classes of posets.

In recent years, researchers have also explored the relationship between Boxicity and Poset Dimension and other graph parameters, such as tree-width, clique number, and chromatic number. Several results have been obtained showing connections between these parameters, which can be useful when analyzing large datasets.

Overall, the study of Boxicity and Poset Dimension has applications in a wide range of fields and has stimulated much research in combinatorial optimization. Although many problems related to these concepts remain open, recent advances have shed light on their connections to other graph parameters, and further research in this area has the potential to unlock new insights and improve the efficiency of data analysis at large.","(418, 17)","Let $G$ be a simple, undirected, finite graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set

","This second part of a 2 volume-expertise is mainly based on the results of the inventory described in the first part. It is also based on a ""worrying"" statement in the terms of reference of this expert report 1, which states that ""Asia enjoys a favourable technological context [in terms of equipment according to UN statistics]. Nevertheless, digital technology is still hardly present in the practices of the member institutions of the Agency and the francophone university community; So distance education is not well developed: there are currently no French-language distance training courses offered by an establishment in Asia; The region has only 14 enrolled in ODL over the period 2010 - 2014; Only three institutions have responded to the AUF's ""Mooc"" calls for projects over the last two years, etc."". The terms of reference also indicate a state of deficiency ""in the Francophone digital campuses whose officials explain that the computer equipment are less and less used for individual practices"". The proliferation of mobile digital technologies that would normally constitute an important asset for the development of teaching practices and innovative research around the Francophone digital campuses has not lived up to expectations. The paper refers to another no less important detail that would explain the paradox between the proliferation of technological tools and the reduction in usage when it indicates that, in parallel, and contrary to the francophone campuses, In English a positive dynamics of integration of T ICE and distance"". The document provides concrete examples, such as the ASEAN Cyber University (ACU) program run by South Korea and its e-learning centers in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar, The Vietnamese language and the fablab set up in the region since 2014 without the Francophonie being involved. A first hypothesis emerges from this premonitory observation that it is not technology that justifies the gradual demobilization (or even demotivation) of local actors to establish forms of Francophone partnerships for training and research. Nor is it a question of political will to improve technological infrastructure in digital training and research.

Almost all the interviews carried out within the framework of this mission demonstrated the convergence of views and ambitious attitudes expressed by three categories of actors encountered:- political actors met in the ministries of education of the three countries who are aware of the importance of digital education and the added value generated by technologies for education. Each of the three countries has a regulatory framework and national technological innovation projects for education and digital education;- public and private academic institutions which, through their rectors, presidents and technical and pedagogical leaders, demonstrate their profound convictions for digital education (for reasons of quality, competitiveness and economic interest).

However, given the rather centralized governance model at state level, the majority of academic institutions in the three countries are often awaiting the promulgation of legal texts (decrees, charters, conventions, directives , Etc.) that enable them to act and adopt innovative solutions in teaching and research;- Teacher-researchers relatively little consulted in this expertise, but sufficiently engaged as actors on the ground to be able to predict their points of view with regard to the use of digital in their pedagogical and research activities. Teachers and researchers with relatively modest incomes would inevitably have a decisive role in any academic reform on the digital level if concrete mobilizing arguments could compensate for their shortfalls by joining digital training or development projects or programs.","(631, 14)","This research paper explores the potential of distance learning and digital tools for higher education and research in the Asia-Pacific region, specifically focusing on Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. The second part of this paper presents a set of recommendations and a roadmap for implementing these technologies in these countries.

The first recommendation is to invest in infrastructure that supports digital learning. This includes building robust networks, providing access to digital devices, and training teachers and students on how to use these tools effectively. Governments and universities must collaborate to make these resources widely available.

The second recommendation is to create and curate high-quality digital content. Textbooks, lectures, and other learning materials should be developed or adapted for digital formats, and made available online for free or at a low cost. Collaboration between institutions can help pool resources and reduce duplication of effort.

The third recommendation is to develop interactive and collaborative learning tools. These tools can help students engage with course materials and with each other, even when they are studying remotely. This can include videoconferencing software, social media platforms, and online discussion forums.

The fourth recommendation is to ensure that the development of digital learning tools is based on research and best practices. This includes evaluating the effectiveness of different tools and approaches, and using this information to improve their design and implementation. Research should also be conducted on the impact of digital learning on student outcomes.

The final recommendation is to foster a culture of innovation and collaboration. This includes creating spaces for experimentation and learning, and providing opportunities for educators and researchers to share their experiences and insights. Governments and universities must work together to support this culture.

To achieve these recommendations, a roadmap is proposed that outlines the necessary steps and timelines. This includes identifying key stakeholders and partners, setting up pilot projects, and scaling up successful initiatives. The roadmap also highlights potential challenges and risks that must be addressed, such as the need for adequate funding and the risk of unequal access to digital resources.

Overall, this paper argues that distance learning and digital tools have the potential to transform higher education and research in the Asia-Pacific region, but that careful planning and implementation are necessary to ensure their effectiveness and accessibility. The recommendations and roadmap presented in this paper can serve as a starting point for governments, universities, and other stakeholders in the region who are interested in pursuing this path.","(450, 22)","This second part of a 2 volume-expertise is mainly based on the results of the

","CEA/IRFM is conducting R\&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the 5 GHz ITER LHCD system, which is expected to transmit 20 MW of RF power to the plasma. Two 5 GHz 500 kW BeO pill-box type window prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company, in close collaboration with CEA/IRFM. Both windows have been validated at low power, showing good agreement between measured and modeling, with a return loss better than 32 dB and an insertion loss below 0.05 dB. This paper reports on the window RF design and the low power measurements. The high power tests up to 500kW have been carried out in March 2013 in collaboration with NFRI. Results of these tests are also reported. In the current ITER LHCD design, 20 MW Continuous Wave (CW) of Radio-Frequency power at 5 GHz are expected to be generated and transmitted to the plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat waveguide pressure, forty eight 5 GHz 500kW CW windows are to be assembled on the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, forty eight additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate and monitor the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line pressure. These windows are identified as being one of the main critical components for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies [1] [2] [3] or more recently [4] [5] , and clearly require an important R\&D effort. In this context and even if the LHCD system is not part of the construction baseline, the CEA/IRFM is conducting a R\&D effort in order to validate a design and the performances of these RF windows. In order to begin the assessment of this need, two 5 GHz 500 kW/5 s pill-box type windows prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company in close collaboration with the CEA/IRFM [6]. The section 2 of this paper reports the RF and mechanical design of a 5 GHz window. Some features of the mechanical design and the experimental RF measurements at low power are reported in section 3. High power results, made in collaboration with NFRI, are detailed in section 4. The development of CW windows is discussed in the conclusion. 2-RF AND MECHANICAL DESIGN The proposed 5 GHz RF window is based on a pill-box design [2] , i.e. a ceramic brazed in portion of a circular waveguide, connected on either side to a rectangular waveguide section. Typical design rules of thumb of such device are circular section diameter about the same size of the diagonal of the rectangular waveguide (cf. FIGURE 1). Without taking into account the ceramic, the circular section length is approximately half a guided wavelength of the circular TE 11 mode, in order for the device to act as a half-wave transformer.

Once optimized, taking into account the ceramic, matching is correct only for a narrow band of frequency and is very sensitive to the device dimensions and the ceramic relative permittivity. The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be extracted by an active water cooling, depends on the inside electric field topology and of ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent). Undesirable modes due to parasitic resonances can be excited in the ceramic volume, raising the electric field and","(624, 24)","The development of next-generation fusion reactors, such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), requires the use of high power sources to generate and sustain plasma. The Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) system is one such high-energy source that is designed to provide steady-state current drive for fusion reactor operation. In order to achieve this, the LHCD system requires a high-power window capable of transmitting RF power to the plasma.

This paper describes the design and RF measurements of a 5 GHz 500 kW window for the ITER LHCD system. The goal of this research was to develop an optimized design for the window that would meet the stringent requirements of the LHCD system, while also providing reliable and efficient operation. The window design was based on a number of key factors, including the transmission properties of the materials, the need for high power handling capability, and the thermal management of the structure.

Simulations were used to optimize the design of the window, and several prototypes were fabricated to investigate the performance of the design under a variety of conditions. RF measurements were taken on the prototypes to determine their transmission properties and to verify that they met the requirements of the LHCD system. The results of these measurements revealed that the window design was able to meet all of the high-power requirements of the ITER LHCD system.

The research also investigated the thermal behavior of the window during operation, using simulations and experimental measurements. The results showed that the thermal management of the window was critical to its performance, as high-power RF transmission caused significant heating of the window. The simulations and experiments showed that effective cooling of the window was necessary to maintain reliable and efficient operation.

In conclusion, this paper presents the design and RF measurements of a 5 GHz 500 kW window for the ITER LHCD system. The research demonstrated the feasibility of the window design, and provided important insights into the challenges associated with high-power RF transmission and thermal management. The results of this research will be useful in the development of next-generation fusion reactors, as they will help to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of the LHCD system.","(397, 15)","CEA/IRFM is conducting R\&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the

microwaves from the gyrotron to the plasma. In this paper, we present the design and RF
measurements of this window.
The window is designed to operate at a frequency of 5 GHz and a power level of 500 kW. It
consists of a dielectric layer sandwiched between two metallic layers. The dielectric layer is
made of alumina (Al2O3), which has a high dielectric constant and a low loss tangent. The
metallic layers are made of copper, which has a high electrical conductivity and a low
resistivity. The thickness of the dielectric layer is 0.5 mm, while the thickness of the metallic
layers is 0.1 mm.
The window was fabricated using a combination of machining and chemical etching. The
dielectric layer was machined to the desired shape and size using a computer numerical
control (CNC) milling machine. The metallic layers were chemically etched using a solution
of ferric chloride (FeCl3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). The etching process was carefully
controlled to ensure that the thickness of the layers was uniform and within the specified
tolerances.
The RF measurements of the window were performed using a vector network analyzer (VNA).
The VNA was connected to the input and output ports of the window using coaxial cables. The
S-parameters of the window were measured at different frequencies and power levels. The
results showed that the window had a low insertion loss (less than 0.1 dB) and a high return
loss (greater than 20 dB) over the entire frequency range of interest. The window also had a
low phase shift (less than 5 degrees) and a high isolation (greater than 30 dB) between the
input and output ports.
Based on these results, we conclude that the window meets the requirements for the ITER
LHCD system. It has a low insertion loss, a high return loss, a low phase shift, and a high
isolation. It is also robust and reliable, as it can withstand high power levels and harsh
environmental conditions. We believe that this window will play a critical role in the success
of the ITER project.","(442, 21)","CEA/IRFM is conducting R\&D efforts in order to validate the critical RF components of the

results showed that the window had a low insertion loss (less than 0.1 dB) and a high return

Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron
","Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron to centimeter size. Meteorites are evidence that individual grains of those sizes were collected and assembled into planetesimals in the young solar system. Aims. We assess the efficiency of dust collection of a swarm of non-drifting planetesimals {\rev with radii ranging from 1 to $10^3$\,km and beyond. Methods. We calculate the collision probability of dust drifting in the disk due to gas drag by planetesimal accounting for several regimes depending on the size of the planetesimal, dust, and orbital distance: the geometric, Safronov, settling, and three-body regimes. We also include a hydrodynamical regime to account for the fact that small grains tend to be carried by the gas flow around planetesimals. Results. We provide expressions for the collision probability of dust by planetesimals and for the filtering efficiency by a swarm of planetesimals. For standard turbulence conditions (i.e., a turbulence parameter $\alpha=10^{-2}$), filtering is found to be inefficient, meaning that when crossing a minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) belt of planetesimals extending between 0.1 AU and 35 AU most dust particles are eventually accreted by the central star rather than colliding with planetesimals. However, if the disk is weakly turbulent ($\alpha=10^{-4}$) filtering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all smaller than about 10 km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in the geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km in size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller than one tenth of the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case most collisions take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very different properties: we find that the local filtering efficiency $x_{filter,MMSN}$ scales with $r^{-7/4}$ (where $r$ is the orbital distance) in the geometric regime, but with $r^{-1/4}$ to $r^{1/4}$ in the settling regime.

This implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur close to the central star and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the other hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling regime is expected to be more gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust particles much smaller than millimeter size tend only to be captured by the smallest planetesimals because they otherwise move on gas streamlines and their collisions take place in the hydrodynamical regime. Conclusions. Our results hint at an inside-out formation of planetesimals in the infant solar system because small planetesimals in the geometrical limit can filter dust much more efficiently close to the central star. However, even a fully-formed belt of planetesimals such as the MMSN only marginally captures inward-drifting dust and this seems to imply that dust in the protosolar disk has been filtered by planetesimals even smaller than 1 km (not included in this study) or that it has been assembled into planetesimals by other mechanisms (e.g., orderly growth, capture into vortexes). Further refinement of our work concerns, among other things: a quantitative description of the transition region between the hydro and settling regimes; an assessment of the role of disk turbulence for collisions, in particular in the hydro regime; and the coupling of our model to a planetesimal formation model.","(646, 20)","This research paper explores the mechanisms of dust filtering and processing in planetesimals, specifically focusing on non-drifting planetesimals. The collision probabilities for such planetesimals were derived and analyzed to illuminate their impacts on the filtration and processing of dust. These collision probabilities were analyzed through numerical simulations, which incorporated varied parameters such as planetesimal radius and density as well as dust particle size and distribution.


The results of the analysis show that non-drifting planetesimals play a significant role in the early stages of planet formation through their ability to filter and process dust. Through collisions with dust particles, these planetesimals are able to both grow in size and remove debris from the surrounding environment. The effects of this filtering and processing are not only important for the planetesimal itself, but also relevant for later stages of planet formation when large bodies form through collisions of planetesimals.


The analytical framework and numerical simulations used in the research provide a foundation for future studies into the processes of dust filtering and processing by planetesimals. The collision probabilities derived for non-drifting planetesimals can be applied to other studies of planetesimal growth and dust filtration, improving our understanding of early stages of planetary formation.


An important implication of this research is that the mechanisms of dust filtration and processing by non-drifting planetesimals enable the successful formation of larger bodies like planets and asteroids, crucial to the evolution of our solar system and others. By examining these mechanisms, insights can be gained not only into the formation of planets, but also into the evolution of other celestial bodies throughout the universe.


In conclusion, this research paper provides a thorough analysis of the collision probabilities for non-drifting planetesimals and their impact on the processing and filtering of dust. The results show that non-drifting planetesimals play an important role in the early stages of planet formation through their ability to remove debris and grow in size. This research can improve our understanding of the formation of planets not only in our solar system, but throughout the universe as well.

Stylolites are ubiquitous geo-patterns observed in rocks in the upper crust, from geological reservoirs in
","Stylolites are ubiquitous geo-patterns observed in rocks in the upper crust, from geological reservoirs in sedimentary rocks to deformation zones, in folds, faults, and shear zones. These rough surfaces play a major role in the dissolution of rocks around stressed contacts, the transport of dissolved material and the precipitation in surrounding pores. Consequently, they play an active role in the evolution of rock microstructures and rheological properties in the Earth's crust. They are observed individually or in networks, in proximity to fractures and joints, and in numerous geological settings. This review article deals with their geometrical and compositional characteristics and the factors leading to their genesis. The main questions this review focuses on are the following: How do they form? How can they be used to measure strain and formation stress? How do they control fluid flow in the upper crust?

Geometrically, stylolites have fractal roughness, with fractal geometrical properties exhibiting typically three scaling regimes: a self-affine scaling with Hurst exponent 1.1+/-0.1 at small scale (up to tens or hundreds of microns), another one with Hurst exponent around 0.5 to 0.6 at intermediate scale (up to millimeters or centimeters), and in the case of sedimentary stylolites, a flat scaling at large scale. More complicated anisotropic scaling (scaling laws depending of the direction of the profile considered) is found in the case of tectonic stylolites. We report models based on first principles from physical chemistry and statistical physics, including a mechanical component for the free-energy associated with stress concentrations, and a precise tracking of the influence of grain-scale heterogeneities and disorder on the resulting (micro)structures. Experimental efforts to reproduce stylolites in the laboratory are also reviewed. We show that although micrometer-size stylolite teeth are obtained in laboratory experiments, teeth deforming numerous grains have not yet been obtained experimentally, which is understandable given the very long formation time of such geometries. Finally, the applications of stylolites as strain and stress markers, to determine paleostress magnitude are reviewed. We show that the scalings in stylolite heights and the crossover scale between these scalings can be used to determine the stress magnitude (its scalar value) perpendicular to the stylolite surface during the stylolite formation, and that the stress anisotropy in the stylolite plane can be determined for the case of tectonic stylolites. We also show that the crossover between medium (millimetric) scales and large (pluricentimetric) scales, in the case of sedimentary stylolites, provides a good marker for the total amount of dissolution, which is still valid even when the largest teeth start to dissolve -- which leads to the loss of information, since the total deformation is not anymore recorded in a single marker structure. We discuss the impact of the stylolites on the evolution of the transport properties of the hosting rock, and show that they promote a permeability increase parallel to the stylolites, whereas their effect on the permeability transverse to the stylolite can be negligible, or may reduce the permeability, depending on the development of the stylolite.

Highlights: Stylolite formation depends on rock composition and structure, stress and fluids. Stylolite geometry, fractal and self-affine properties, network structure, are investigated. The experiments and physics-based numerical models for their formation are reviewed. Stylolites can be used as markers of strain, paleostress orientation and magnitude. Stylolites impact transport properties, as function of maturity and flow direction.","(627, 22)","Stylolites are a critical feature in sedimentary rocks, which have garnered significant interest over the years given their widespread occurrence and potential significance in several geological processes. In this review, we provide an extensive analysis of the literature available on stylolites, thereby enabling a better understanding of their behavior and formation mechanisms. First, we discuss the various historical perspectives on stylolites and the evolution of ideas explaining their formation. Subsequently, we delve into the current understanding of the physical and chemical processes that induce and animate stylolites. We highlight field and laboratory studies, alongside analytical techniques such as petrography, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe, and Raman spectroscopy, which have contributed significantly to the current state of knowledge on stylolites.

We further analyze the composition and mineralogy of stylolites with a discussion on their role in hydrocarbon exploration. We evaluate the interplay between mechanical and chemical compaction mechanisms in their formation and briefly examine some of the significant implications in reservoir quality assessments. We discuss how their presence can affect porosity, permeability, and ultimately oil recovery in underground reservoirs and provide a comprehensive review of the available literature on stylolites as a tool in hydrocarbon exploration. 

Furthermore, we expound on the association of stylolites with various geological phenomena, including deformation stress, fluid activity, and diagenesis. We examine the evidence of syn-sedimentary versus post-sedimentary origin of stylolites, which has significant implications for their interpretation and paleo-environmental reconstructions. The review offers insight into the potential use of stylolites in paleostress and paleohydrology analysis and their significance as proxies for burial depth. 

We conclude our review by discussing current controversies in the field of stylolites such as their mode of initiation, the extent of their influence on rock properties, and their role as deformation markers. Additionally, we highlight some of the gaps in current knowledge on stylolites and offer suggestions for future research areas.

Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to give
","Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to give H(2)O(2). Recently, the mutation of the Glu47 residue into alanine (E47A) in the active site of SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii has allowed the stabilization of an iron-peroxo species when quickly reacted with H(2)O(2) [Math{\'e} et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 4966-4967]. To further investigate this non-heme peroxo-iron species, we have carried out a M{\""o}ssbauer study of the (57)Fe-enriched E47A SOR from D. baarsii reacted quickly with H(2)O(2). Considering the M{\""o}ssbauer data, we conclude, in conjunction with the other spectroscopic data available and with the results of density functional calculations on related models, that this species corresponds to a high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) complex. This is one of the first examples of such a species in a biological system for which M{\""o}ssbauer parameters are now available: delta(/Fe) = 0.54 (1) mm/s, DeltaE(Q) = -0.80 (5) mm/s, and the asymmetry parameter eta = 0.60 (5) mm/s. The M{\""o}ssbauer and spin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on peroxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center in SOR from Pyrococcus furiosus, for which structural data are available in the literature [Yeh et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2499-2508]. For comparison, similar calculations have been carried out on a model derived from 2 (model 3), where the [CH(3)-S](1)(-) group has been replaced by the neutral [NH(3)](0) group [Neese and Solomon (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12829-12848]. Both models 2 and 3 contain a formally high-spin Fe(3+) ion (i.e., with empty minority spin orbitals). We found, however, a significant fraction (approximately 0.6 for 2, approximately 0.8 for 3) of spin (equivalently charge) spread over two occupied (minority spin) orbitals. The quadrupole splitting value for 2 is found to be negative and matches quite well the experimental value. The computed quadrupole tensors are rhombic in the case of 2 and axial in the case of 3. This difference originates directly from the presence of the thiolate ligand in 2. A correlation between experimental isomer shifts for Fe(3+) mononuclear complexes with computed electron densities at the iron nucleus has been built and used to evaluate the isomer shift values for 2 and 3 (0.56 and 0.63 mm/s, respectively). A significant increase of isomer shift value is found upon going from a methylthiolate to a nitrogen ligand for the Fe(3+) ion, consistent with covalency effects due to the presence of the axial thiolate ligand. Considering that the isomer shift value for 3 is likely to be in the 0.61-0.65 mm/s range [Horner et al. (2002) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 3278-3283], the isomer shift value for a high-spin eta(2)-O(2) Fe(3+) complex with an axial thiolate group can be estimated to be in the 0.54-0.58 mm/s range. The occurrence of a side-on peroxo intermediate in SOR is discussed in relation to the recent data published for a side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) species in another biological system [Karlsson et al.

Our investigation sheds light on the structure and properties of this particular peroxo-Fe3+ species, with implications for elucidating the mechanism of superoxide reduction by this enzyme. 

Our M{\""o}ssbauer spectroscopy measurements reveal the presence of a high-spin Fe3+ center in the peroxo species, which exhibits an unusual side-on binding mode. This finding is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which predict a high-spin, side-on peroxo-Fe3+ species as the most stable configuration. Our theoretical calculation of the M{\""o}ssbauer spectrum of the proposed side-on peroxo-Fe3+ species shows good agreement with the experimental spectrum. 

Additionally, we investigate the effect of various ligands on the stability and electronic properties of the peroxo species using DFT. Our calculations indicate that specific ligands, such as imidazole, can have a significant impact on the electronic structure of the peroxo-Fe3+ center. We also investigate the reactivity of the peroxo species towards superoxide, using DFT to calculate the activation barriers for the reaction.

Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive
","Probability theory, epistemically interpreted, provides an excellent, if not the best available account of inductive reasoning. This is so because there are general and definite rules for the change of subjective probabilities through information or experience; induction and belief change are one and same topic, after all. The most basic of these rules is simply to conditionalize with respect to the information received; and there are similar and more general rules. 1 Hence, a fundamental reason for the epistemological success of probability theory is that there at all exists a well-behaved concept of conditional probability. Still, people have, and have reasons for, various concerns over probability theory. One of these is my starting point: Intuitively, we have the notion of plain belief; we believe propositions2 to be true (or to be false or neither). Probability theory, however, offers no formal counterpart to this notion. Believing A is not the same as having probability 1 for A, because probability 1 is incorrigible3; but plain belief is clearly corrigible. And believing A is not the same as giving A a probability larger than some 1 - c, because believing A and believing B is usually taken to be equivalent to believing A & B.4 Thus, it seems that the formal representation of plain belief has to take a non-probabilistic route. Indeed, representing plain belief seems easy enough: simply represent an epistemic state by the set of all propositions believed true in it or, since I make the common assumption that plain belief is deductively closed, by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it. But this does not yet provide a theory of induction, i.e.

an answer to the question how epistemic states so represented are changed tbrough information or experience. There is a convincing partial answer: if the new information is compatible with the old epistemic state, then the new epistemic state is simply represented by the conjunction of the new information and the old beliefs. This answer is partial because it does not cover the quite common case where the new information is incompatible with the old beliefs. It is, however, important to complete the answer and to cover this case, too; otherwise, we would not represent plain belief as conigible. The crucial problem is that there is no good completion. When epistemic states are represented simply by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it, the answer cannot be completed; and though there is a lot of fruitful work, no other representation of epistemic states has been proposed, as far as I know, which provides a complete solution to this problem. In this paper, I want to suggest such a solution. In [4], I have more fully argued that this is the only solution, if certain plausible desiderata are to be satisfied. Here, in section 2, I will be content with formally defining and intuitively explaining my proposal. I will compare my proposal with probability theory in section 3. It will turn out that the theory I am proposing is structurally homomorphic to probability theory in important respects and that it is thus equally easily implementable, but moreover computationally simpler. Section 4 contains a very brief comparison with various kinds of logics, in particular conditional logic, with Shackle's functions of potential surprise and related theories, and with the Dempster - Shafer theory of belief functions.","(632, 23)","Inductive reasoning plays a vital role in scientific inquiry by enabling the inference of conclusions from empirical data. Despite its significance, there exist fundamental challenges in explicating the foundations of inductive reasoning. In particular, traditional approaches have used probabilistic frameworks as the primary tool for modeling inductive reasoning. However, this approach has limited application in real-life scenarios, and even fails to provide an adequate explanation for phenomena that involve non-probabilistic or correlated uncertainties. In this paper, we introduce a general non-probabilistic theory of inductive reasoning, which offers a fresh perspective on traditional models of reasoning. Our theory considers inductive reasoning as a process of developing theories about the causal structure of a given phenomenon, and seeks to provide a systematic framework for this process. Our approach considers the problem of inductive reasoning as part of a larger context of decision-making under uncertainty, and utilizes tools from causal inference, game theory, and information theory.

Through the lens of our theory, we can better understand and formalize the process of inductive reasoning. Specifically, we articulate a new framework that identifies the causal structure of a given phenomenon as the key element for making sound inductive inferences, and further explore how this structure can be uncovered. Our framework is founded on the idea that inductive reasoning can be viewed as a game between the reasoner and nature, and that the optimal strategy in this game requires an analysis of the causal structure. We then introduce a new class of models that capture non-probabilistic uncertainties and are well-defined within this framework. These models are shown to be as versatile as probabilistic models in describing inductive reasoning, and in fact, can better capture the nuances of non-probabilistic uncertainties.

Overall, the proposed non-probabilistic theory of inductive reasoning offers a new approach to model and solve complicated inductive inference problems. It leverages advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence to bring us one step closer to achieving a more general understanding of inductive reasoning. We conclude by highlighting some future directions for research, including the challenges in developing new methodologies and applications for the principle of inductive inference.

Given a universe of discourse X-a domain of possible outcomes-an experiment may consist of selecting
","Given a universe of discourse X-a domain of possible outcomes-an experiment may consist of selecting one of its elements, subject to the operation of chance, or of observing the elements, subject to imprecision. A priori uncertainty about the actual result of the experiment may be quantified, representing either the likelihood of the choice of :r_X or the degree to which any such X would be suitable as a description of the outcome. The former case corresponds to a probability distribution, while the latter gives a possibility assignment on X. The study of such assignments and their properties falls within the purview of possibility theory [DP88, Y80, Z783. It, like probability theory, assigns values between 0 and 1 to express likelihoods of outcomes.

Here, however, the similarity ends. Possibility theory uses the maximum and minimum functions to combine uncertainties, whereas probability theory uses the plus and times operations. This leads to very dissimilar theories in terms of analytical framework, even though they share several semantic concepts. One of the shared concepts consists of expressing quantitatively the uncertainty associated with a given distribution. In probability theory its value corresponds to the gain of information that would result from conducting an experiment and ascertaining an actual result. This gain of information can equally well be viewed as a decrease in uncertainty about the outcome of an experiment. In this case the standard measure of information, and thus uncertainty, is Shannon entropy [AD75, G77]. It enjoys several advantages-it is characterized uniquely by a few, very natural properties, and it can be conveniently used in decision processes. This application is based on the principle of maximum entropy; it has become a popular method of relating decisions to uncertainty. This paper demonstrates that an equally integrated theory can be built on the foundation of possibility theory. We first show how to define measures of in formation and uncertainty for possibility assignments.

Next we construct an information-based metric on the space of all possibility distributions defined on a given domain. It allows us to capture the notion of proximity in information content among the distributions. Lastly, we show that all the above constructions can be carried out for continuous distributions-possibility assignments on arbitrary measurable domains. We consider this step very significant-finite domains of discourse are but approximations of the real-life infinite domains. If possibility theory is to represent real world situations, it must handle continuous distributions both directly and through finite approximations. In the last section we discuss a principle of maximum uncertainty for possibility distributions. We show how such a principle could be formalized as an inference rule. We also suggest it could be derived as a consequence of simple assumptions about combining information. We would like to mention that possibility assignments can be viewed as fuzzy sets and that every fuzzy set gives rise to an assignment of possibilities. This correspondence has far reaching consequences in logic and in control theory. Our treatment here is independent of any special interpretation; in particular we speak of possibility distributions and possibility measures, defining them as measurable mappings into the interval [0, 1]. Our presentation is intended as a self-contained, albeit terse summary.

Topics discussed were selected with care, to demonstrate both the completeness and a certain elegance of the theory. Proofs are not included; we only offer illustrative examples.","(615, 30)","This research paper presents a formal model of uncertainty for possibilistic rules. Possibilistic rules are commonly used in the fields of artificial intelligence, fuzzy logic, and decision-making. The proposed model aims to provide a means of quantifying the uncertainty inherent in these rules.

To achieve this goal, the model introduces the notion of a possibility distribution function. This function assigns a possibility value to each possible state of the world, representing the degree to which that state is possible given the available evidence and the uncertainty inherent in the possibilistic rules. The model also defines a set of rules for combining possibility values, allowing for the aggregation of uncertain information from multiple sources.

The proposed model provides several key benefits over existing approaches to uncertainty in possibilistic rules. First, it provides a more principled and rigorous mathematical framework for dealing with uncertainty in these rules. Second, it allows for a more flexible representation of uncertainty, enabling the modeling of more complex and nuanced forms of uncertainty. Finally, it enables the use of a wider range of probabilistic inference techniques, allowing for more accurate and efficient decision-making.

To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model, we provide several empirical evaluations. These evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in capturing and reasoning with uncertainty in various scenarios. Specifically, we show that the model can accurately capture uncertainty in complex decision-making tasks, such as medical diagnosis and financial forecasting. We also show that the model is computationally efficient, making it feasible for use in real-world applications.

","Let $(\{X_i(t)\}_{i\in \mathbb{Z}^d})_{t\geq 0}$ be the system of interacting diffusions on $[0,\infty)$ defined by the following collection of coupled stochastic differential equations: \begin{eqnarray}dX_i(t)=\sum\limits_{j\in \mathbb{Z}^d}a(i,j)[X_j(t)-X_i(t)] dt+\sqrt{bX_i(t)^2} dW_i(t), \eqntext{i\in \mathbb{Z}^d,t\geq 0.}\end{eqnarray} Here, $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is an irreducible random walk transition kernel on $\mathbb{Z}^d\times \mathbb{Z}^d$, $b\in (0,\infty)$ is a diffusion parameter, and $(\{W_i(t)\}_{i\in \mathbb{Z}^d})_{t\geq 0}$ is a collection of independent standard Brownian motions on $\mathbb{R}$. The initial condition is chosen such that $\{X_i(0)\}_{i\in \mathbb{Z}^d}$ is a shift-invariant and shift-ergodic random field on $[0,\infty)$ with mean $\Theta\in (0,\infty)$ (the evolution preserves the mean). We show that the long-time behavior of this system is the result of a delicate interplay between $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ and $b$, in contrast to systems where the diffusion function is subquadratic. In particular, let $\hat{a}(i,j)={1/2}[a(i,j)+a(j,i)]$, $i,j\in \mathbb{Z}^d$, denote the symmetrized transition kernel. We show that: (A) If $\hat{a}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is recurrent, then for any $b>0$ the system locally dies out. (B) If $\hat{a}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is transient, then there exist $b_*\geq b_2>0$ such that: (B1)d The system converges to an equilibrium $\nu_{\Theta}$ (with mean $\Theta$) if $0<b<b_*$. (B2) The system locally dies out if $b>b_*$. (B3) $\nu_{\Theta}$ has a finite 2nd moment if and only if $0<b<b_2$. (B4) The 2nd moment diverges exponentially fast if and only if $b>b_2$. The equilibrium $\nu_{\Theta}$ is shown to be associated and mixing for all $0<b<b_*$. We argue in favor of the conjecture that $b_*>b_2$. We further conjecture that the system locally dies out at $b=b_*$. For the case where $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is symmetric and transient we further show that: (C) There exists a sequence $b_2\geq b_3\geq b_4\geq ... >0$ such that: (C1) $\nu_{\Theta}$ has a finite $m$th moment if and only if $0<b<b_m$. (C2) The $m$th moment diverges exponentially fast if and only if $b>b_m$. (C3) $b_2\leq (m-1)b_m<2$. uad(C4) $\lim_{m\to\infty}(m-1)b_m=c=\sup_{m\geq 2}(m-1)b_m$. The proof of these results is based on self-duality and on a representation formula through which the moments of the components are related to exponential moments of the collision local time of random walks. Via large deviation theory, the latter lead to variational expressions for $b_*$ and the $b_m$'s, from which sharp bounds are deduced. The critical value $b_*$ arises from a stochastic representation of the Palm distribution of the system. The special case where $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is simple random walk is commonly referred to as the parabolic Anderson model with Brownian noise. This case was studied in the memoir by Carmona and Molchanov [Parabolic Anderson Problem and Intermittency (1994) Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI], where part of our results were already established.","(851, 24)","This research paper investigates phase transitions in the long-time behavior of interacting diffusions. Alongside phase transitions in the Ising model, the authors demonstrate the existence of phase transitions for interacting diffusions in a bounded domain. Specifically, the authors study the asymptotic behavior of the occupation time near the boundary of the domain and the formation of persistent macroscopic clusters. For this purpose, they use representation formulas for occupation times and establish the asymptotics of the same. The authors derive phase diagrams based on the occupation time, and these phase diagrams are quite different from the traditional ones for the Ising model. Furthermore, the authors show that the phase transition for interacting diffusions is much richer than that for the Ising model, as it exhibits a discontinuity phenomenon. They discuss the origin of this discontinuity phenomenon and describe how it arises from a subtle interplay between the sub-diffusive nature of the diffusion process and the interaction among particles.

The authors conduct simulations to verify their analytical results and study the long-time behavior of interacting Brownian particles in a bounded domain. They provide numerical evidence of the existence of multiple phases for the occupation time near the boundary and demonstrate the discontinuity phenomenon of the phase transition. They also observe the emergence of macroscopic clusters in numerical simulations and show that they are responsible for the mentioned discontinuity.

In conclusion, the findings of this research paper demonstrate that the long-time behavior of interacting diffusions exhibits phase transitions that are significantly different from those in the Ising model. The authors establish the existence of a discontinuity phenomenon that is a result of subtle interactions between the sub-diffusive nature of the diffusion process and the interaction among particles. They provide rigorous mathematical proofs and numerical simulations to support their claims.

where $B_i(t)$ is a standard Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $V:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a potential function. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of $X_i(t)$ as $t\rightarrow \infty$. In particular, we would like to know if there exists a phase transition in the long-time behavior depending on the choice of $V$.
To answer this question, we first consider the case where $V(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2$. In this case, it can be shown that the system of diffusions converges to a unique stationary distribution, which is given by the Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$. This implies that there is no phase transition in this case.
Next, we consider the more general case where $V$ is an arbitrary potential function. In this case, we can use the theory of large deviations to show that there is a phase transition if and only if the potential function $V$ satisfies the following condition:
$$\lim_{|x|\rightarrow \infty} \frac{V(x)}{|x|^2} = \infty$$
This condition ensures that the potential function grows faster than quadratically at infinity, which is necessary for the existence of a phase transition. On the other hand, if $V$ does not satisfy this condition, then the system will converge to the same stationary distribution as in the quadratic case.
In conclusion, we have shown that there is a non-trivial phase transition in the asymptotic behaviour of interacting diffusions depending on the shape of the potential function.

On the other hand, if $V$ does not satisfy this condition, then the system will converge to the same stationary distribution as in the quadratic case.

The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important
","The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Due to the plasma screening effect, the color attraction between the heavy quark antiquark pair inside a quarkonium is significantly suppressed at high temperature and thus no bound states can exist, i.e., they ""melt"". In addition, a bound heavy quark antiquark pair can dissociate if enough energy is transferred to it in a dynamical process inside the plasma. So one would expect the production of quarkonium to be considerably suppressed in heavy ion collisions. However, experimental measurements have shown that a large amount of quarkonia survive the evolution inside the high temperature plasma. It is realized that the in-medium recombination of unbound heavy quark pairs into quarkonium is as crucial as the melting and dissociation. Thus, phenomenological studies have to account for static screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. But recombination is less understood theoretically than the melting and dissociation. Many studies using semi-classical transport equations model the recombination effect from the consideration of detailed balance at thermal equilibrium. However, these studies cannot explain how the system of quarkonium reaches equilibrium and estimate the time scale of the thermalization.

Recently, another approach based on the open quantum system formalism started being used. In this framework, one solves a quantum evolution for in-medium quarkonium. Dissociation and recombination are accounted for consistently.

However, the connection between the semi-classical transport equation and the quantum evolution is not clear. In this dissertation, I will try to address the issues raised above. As a warm-up project, I will first study a similar problem: $\alpha$-$\alpha$ scattering at the $^8$Be resonance inside an $e^-e^+\gamma$ plasma. By applying pionless effective field theory and thermal field theory, I will show how the plasma screening effect modifies the $^8$Be resonance energy and width. I will discuss the need to use the open quantum system formalism when studying the time evolution of a system embedded inside a plasma. Then I will use effective field theory of QCD and the open quantum system formalism to derive a Lindblad equation for bound and unbound heavy quark antiquark pairs inside a weakly-coupled QGP. Under the Markovian approximation and the assumption of weak coupling between the system and the environment, the Lindblad equation will be shown to turn to a Boltzmann transport equation if a Wigner transform is applied to the open system density matrix. These assumptions will be justified by using the separation of scales, which is assumed in the construction of effective field theory. I will show the scattering amplitudes that contribute to the collision terms in the Boltzmann equation are gauge invariant and infrared safe. By coupling the transport equation of quarkonium with those of open heavy flavors and solving them using Monte Carlo simulations, I will demonstrate how the system of bound and unbound heavy quark antiquark pairs reaches detailed balance and equilibrium inside the QGP. Phenomenologically, my calculations can describe the experimental data on bottomonium production. Finally I will extend the framework to study the in-medium evolution of heavy diquarks and estimate the production rate of the doubly charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ in heavy ion collisions.","(600, 25)","Effective Field Theory (EFT) has become an increasingly important tool in the field of nuclear physics, providing a systematic framework for conducting calculations in a range of energy regimes. By treating the nuclear force as a perturbation of an underlying theory, such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), EFT allows for the accurate prediction of observables across a broad range of energies and systems.

In this paper, we review the application of EFT in nuclear physics, discussing its fundamental principles and its use in nuclear structure, nuclear reactions and nuclear astrophysics. We first summarize the basic concepts of EFT, including power counting, renormalization and the operator product expansion, and their applicability to nuclear forces.

We then present several examples of EFT calculations in nuclear structure, including the prediction of ground-state properties, such as binding energies and radii, and excited-state spectra, such as giant resonances and alpha clustering. We demonstrate the advantages of EFT over other approaches, such as shell model and mean-field theory, in providing accurate and systematic descriptions of nuclear phenomena.

Next, we discuss EFT in the context of nuclear reactions, with a focus on low-energy reactions, such as radiative capture and scattering, and their relevance for nuclear astrophysics. We review the formalism of EFT for few-nucleon scattering and its extension to more complex systems, such as those encountered in nuclear astrophysics, and describe its successes in explaining experimental data and predicting astrophysical reaction rates.

Finally, we discuss the future prospects of EFT in nuclear physics, considering its potential impact on our understanding of neutron-rich and exotic nuclei, the physics of the neutron star crust and the equation of state of nuclear matter. We conclude that EFT has emerged as a powerful and versatile tool in nuclear physics, capable of providing accurate and systematic predictions across a range of nuclear phenomena and regimes. Its future impact on nuclear physics is likely to be significant, enabling predictions of unprecedented accuracy for a range of important experiments and observations.","(367, 11)","The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important

Context. The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three pillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions
","Context. The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three pillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions ("" cold chemistry ""), endothermic neutral-neutral reactions with significant activation barriers ("" warm chemistry ""), and reactions on the surfaces of dust grains. While warm chemistry becomes important in the shocks associated with turbulent dissipation regions, the main path for the formation of interstellar OH and H2O is that of cold chemistry. Aims. The aim of this study is to observationally confirm the association of atomic oxygen with both atomic and molecular gas phases, and to understand the measured abundances of OH and OH + as a function of the available reservoir of H2. Methods. We obtained absorption spectra of the ground states of OH, OH+ and OI with high-velocity resolution, with GREAT on-board SOFIA, and with the THz receiver at the APEX. We analyzed them along with ancillary spectra of HF and CH from HIFI. To deconvolve them from the hyperfine structure and to separate the blend that is due to various velocity components on the sightline, we fit model spectra consisting of an appropriate number of Gaussian profiles using a method combining simulated annealing with downhill simplex minimization. Together with HF and/or CH as a surrogate for H2, and HI $\lambda$21 cm data, the molecular hydrogen fraction f^N\_H2 = N(H 2)/(N(H) + 2N(H 2)) can be determined. We then investigated abundance ratios as a function of f^N\_H2. Results. The column density of OI is correlated at a high significance with the amount of available molecular and atomic hydrogen, with an atomic oxygen abundance of $3 \times 10 ^{-4}$ relative to H nuclei.

While the velocities of the absorption features of OH and OH+ are loosely correlated and reflect the spiral arm crossings on the sightline, upon closer inspection they display an anticorrespondence. The arm-to-interarm density contrast is found to be higher in OH than in OH+. While both species can coexist, with a higher abundance in OH than in OH+, the latter is found less frequently in absence of OH than the other way around, which is a direct consequence of the rapid destruction of OH+ by dissociative recombination when not enough H2 is available. This conjecture has been substantiated by a comparison between the OH/OH+ ratio with f^N\_H2, showing a clear correlation.

The hydrogen abstraction reaction chain OH+ (H2,H) H2O+ (H2,H)H3O+ is confirmed as the pathway for the production of OH and H 2 O. Our estimate of the branching ratio of the dissociative recombination of H3O+ to OH and H2O is confined within the interval of 84 to 91%, which matches laboratory measurements (74 to 83%). -- A correlation between the linewidths and column densities of OH+ features is found to be significant with a false-alarm probability below 5%. Such a correlation is predicted by models of interstellar MHD turbulence. For OH the same correlation is found to be insignificant because there are more narrow absorption features. Conclusions. While it is difficult to assess the contributions of warm neutral-neutral chemistry to the observed abundances, it seems fair to conclude that the predictions of cold ion-neutral chemistry match the abundance patterns we observed.","(603, 24)","This study presents an analysis of far-infrared observational data to detect tracers of oxygen chemistry in diffuse clouds. Diffuse clouds have low density and are primarily composed of atomic hydrogen, with small amounts of He, C, N, O, etc. Despite their low density, these clouds contain a significant fraction of the interstellar gas in our galaxy. The chemical evolution of diffuse clouds is fundamentally different from that of dense clouds, and the key chemical processes that control their physical characteristics are not yet fully understood. The far-infrared spectral range is key to unveil the composition and chemical properties of these clouds.

We analyzed far-infrared spectral data acquired using the Herschel Space Observatory to measure major cooling lines from the oxygen chemistry in diffuse clouds. The excitation of these lines frequently emerges from chemical processes that originate from photoabsorption or photoionization by far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons. The set of observed cooling lines and their relative intensities can, in principle, provide constraints on the physical conditions, composition, and life cycle of diffuse clouds.

Our analysis focused on a sample of known diffuse clouds whose spectroscopic features show clear evidence for the presence of atomic and molecular tracers of the gas-phase oxygen chemistry. Oxygen molecules such as O$_2$, O$_3$, and CO are the strongest tracers due to their high abundance and relative stability at low density. Our goal was to use the cooling lines from these tracers to constrain the physical and chemical properties of the diffuse clouds and to investigate variations in the gas-phase oxygen chemistry in different environments of the Milky Way.

Our analysis yielded several key results. First, we detected parent and daughter cooling lines from O$_3$ and O$_2$ with the highest signal-to-noise ratio among the observed features. This suggests that O$_3$ and O$_2$ are the most efficient cooling mechanisms in FUV-illuminated diffuse clouds. Second, we found empirical correlations between the relative cooling line intensities and the FUV radiation field strength in our sample. These correlations provide important constraints on the chemical and physical evolution of the diffuse clouds. Finally, we detected the CO fundamental transitions at 4.7 and 2.6 THz in several sources, consistent with previous detections of CO in diffuse clouds.

Our results demonstrate the power and importance of far-infrared studies for understanding the composition and chemical properties of diffuse clouds. Our analysis of the various tracers of oxygen chemistry in these clouds can provide constraints on the formation, physical properties, and evolution of diffuse clouds in different regions of the galaxy. Furthermore, our empirical correlations suggest that FUV radiation fields play an essential role in regulating the physical conditions and chemical properties of diffuse clouds. Our findings can inform future studies of the chemical and physical evolution of molecular gas in the Universe.","(516, 21)","Context.

In [12], Nilsson proposed the probabilistic logic in which the truth values of logical propositions
","In [12], Nilsson proposed the probabilistic logic in which the truth values of logical propositions are probability values between 0 and 1. It is applicable to any logical system for which the consistency of a finite set of propositions can be established. The probabilistic inference scheme reduces to the ordinary logical inference when the probabilities of all propositions are either 0 or 1. This logic has the same limitations of other probabilistic reasoning systems of the Bayesian approach. For common sense reasoning, consistency is not a very natural assumption. We have some well known examples: {Dick is a Quaker, Quakers are pacifists, Republicans are not pacifists, Dick is a Republican}and {Tweety is a bird, birds can fly, Tweety is a penguin}. In this paper, we shall propose some extensions of the probabilistic logic. In the second section, we shall consider the space of all interpretations, consistent or not. In terms of frames of discernment, the basic probability assignment (bpa) and belief function can be defined. Dempster's combination rule is applicable. This extension of probabilistic logic is called the evidential logic in [ 1]. For each proposition s, its belief function is represented by an interval [Spt(s), Pls(s)]. When all such intervals collapse to single points, the evidential logic reduces to probabilistic logic (in the generalized version of not necessarily consistent interpretations). Certainly, we get Nilsson's probabilistic logic by further restricting to consistent interpretations. In the third section, we shall give a probabilistic interpretation of probabilistic logic in terms of multi-dimensional random variables. This interpretation brings the probabilistic logic into the framework of probability theory. Let us consider a finite set S = {sl, s2, ..., Sn) of logical propositions. Each proposition may have true or false values; and may be considered as a random variable. We have a probability distribution for each proposition. The e-dimensional random variable (sl,..., Sn) may take values in the space of all interpretations of 2n binary vectors. We may compute absolute (marginal), conditional and joint probability distributions. It turns out that the permissible probabilistic interpretation vector of Nilsson [12] consists of the joint probabilities of S. Inconsistent interpretations will not appear, by setting their joint probabilities to be zeros. By summing appropriate joint probabilities, we get probabilities of individual propositions or subsets of propositions. Since the Bayes formula and other techniques are valid for e-dimensional random variables, the probabilistic logic is actually very close to the Bayesian inference schemes. In the last section, we shall consider a relaxation scheme for probabilistic logic. In this system, not only new evidences will update the belief measures of a collection of propositions, but also constraint satisfaction among these propositions in the relational network will revise these measures. This mechanism is similar to human reasoning which is an evaluative process converging to the most satisfactory result. The main idea arises from the consistent labeling problem in computer vision. This method is originally applied to scene analysis of line drawings. Later, it is applied to matching, constraint satisfaction and multi sensor fusion by several authors [8], [16] (and see references cited there). Recently, this method is used in knowledge aggregation by Landy and Hummel [9].","(629, 31)","Probabilistic logic has proven to be a powerful tool for dealing with uncertainty and reasoning under incomplete or inconsistent information. This paper explores some extensions of probabilistic logic that have been proposed in the literature, with a focus on probabilistic defeasible reasoning, Bayesian knowledge bases, and probabilistic programming.

Probabilistic defeasible reasoning extends classical defeasible reasoning to handle uncertain knowledge, allowing the derivation of conclusions that are not necessarily warranted by the premises but are still plausible given the available evidence. We review several approaches to probabilistic defeasible reasoning, including probabilistic argumentation, maximum entropy-based inference, and Bayesian networks with uncertain evidence.

Bayesian knowledge bases combine probabilistic logic with ontology representation to model uncertain and incomplete knowledge about a domain. We discuss the main features of Bayesian knowledge bases, including hierarchical structure, probabilistic axioms, and inference algorithms. We also examine some applications of Bayesian knowledge bases in natural language understanding, diagnosis, and prediction.

Probabilistic programming is a recent paradigm for defining probabilistic models and conducting probabilistic inference via computer programs. We introduce the basic concepts of probabilistic programming, including random variables, conditioning, and inference. We outline some of the key challenges in developing efficient and expressive probabilistic programming languages, such as handling the combination of discrete and continuous probability distributions, dealing with large-scale probabilistic models, and designing effective inference algorithms.

We then discuss some open research questions and opportunities in the area of probabilistic logic extensions. One promising direction is to study the integration of probabilistic logic with other probabilistic models, such as decision networks, relational models, and time series models. Another direction is to investigate the foundations of probabilistic logic and its connections with other areas of logic and mathematics, such as paraconsistent logic, nonstandard analysis, and category theory.

Finally, we conclude by highlighting the potential impact and practical applications of probabilistic logic extensions in various fields, such as artificial intelligence, cognitive science, biology, economics, and social sciences. We argue that the development of advanced probabilistic reasoning techniques and tools is crucial for addressing complex real-world problems that involve uncertainty, ambiguity, and incomplete data.","(390, 15)","In [12], Nilsson proposed the probabilistic logic in which the truth values of logical propositions

Conditional Probability in Probabilistic Logic
In probabilistic logic, the truth value of a logical proposition is a real number between 0 and
1. The truth value of a proposition represents the probability that the proposition is true. For
example, if the truth value of the proposition ""It will rain tomorrow"" is 0.6, then there is a 60%
chance that it will rain tomorrow.
The concept of conditional probability is central to probabilistic logic. Conditional probability
is the probability of one event given that another event has occurred. In probabilistic logic,
the conditional probability of a proposition A given a proposition B is denoted by P(A|B) and
is defined as follows:
P(A|B) = P(AB)/P(B)
where P(AB) is the joint probability of A and B, and P(B) is the probability of B.
Relationship between Probabilistic Logic and Classical Logic
Probabilistic logic is a generalization of classical logic. In classical logic, the truth values of
logical propositions are either 0 (false) or 1 (true). In probabilistic logic, however, the truth
values of logical propositions can take any value between 0and 1. This means that probabilistic
logic is more expressive than classical logic.
One way to think of probabilistic logic is as a continuous version of classical logic. Just as
classical logic can be thought of as a discrete version of fuzzy logic, probabilistic logic can be
thought of as a continuous extension of classical logic.
Reasoning about Uncertain Knowledge
One of the main advantages of probabilistic logic over classical logic is that it allows us to
reason about uncertain knowledge. In many real-world situations, we cannot be certain about
the truth of a proposition. For example, when we make a prediction about the future, we cannot
be certain that our prediction will come true. However, we can assign a probability to our
prediction, which represents our degree of confidence in the prediction.

Using nCB films adsorbed on MoS 2 substrates studied by x-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and
","Using nCB films adsorbed on MoS 2 substrates studied by x-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, we demonstrate that ordered interfaces with well-defined orientations of adsorbed dipoles induce planar anchoring locked along the adsorbed dipoles or the alkyl chains, which play the role of easy axes. For two alternating orientations of the adsorbed dipoles or dipoles and alkyl chains, bi-stability of anchoring can be obtained.

The results are explained using the introduction of fourth order terms in the phenomenological anchoring potential, leading to the demonstration of first order anchoring transition in these systems. Using this phenomenological anchoring potential, we finally show how the nature of anchoring in presence of dual easy axes (inducing bi-stability or average orientation between the two easy axes) can be related to the microscopical nature of the interface.

Introduction Understanding the interactions between liquid crystal (LC) and a solid substrate is of clear applied interest, the vast majority of LC displays relying on control of interfaces. However this concerns also fundamental problems like wetting phenomena and all phenomena of orientation of soft matter bulk induced by the presence of an interface. In LCs at interfaces, the so-called easy axes correspond to the favoured orientations of the LC director close to the interface. If one easy axis only is defined for one given interface, the bulk director orients along or close to this axis [1]. It is well known that, in anchoring phenomena, two major effects compete to impose the anchoring directions of a liquid crystal, first, the interactions between molecules and the interface, second, the substrate roughness whose role has been analyzed by Berreman [2]. The influence of adsorbed molecular functional groups at the interface is most often dominant with, for example in carbon substrates, a main influence of unsaturated carbon bonds orientation at the interface [3]. In common LC displays, there is one unique easy axis, but modifications of surfaces have allowed for the discovery of promising new anchoring-related properties. For instance, the first anchoring bi-stability has been established on rough surfaces, associated with electric ordo-polarization [4] and the competition between a stabilizing short-range term and a destabilizing long-range term induced by an external field, can induce a continuous variation of anchoring orientation [5]. More recently, surfaces with several easy axes have been studied extensively. It has been shown that control of a continuous variation of director pretilt, obtained in several systems [6, 7], is associated with the presence of two different easy axes, one perpendicular to the substrate (homeotropic) and one planar [7, 8].

Similar models can explain the continuous evolution of anchoring between two planar orientations observed on some crystalline substrates [9]. However, in the same time, two easy axes can also lead to anchoring bi-stability [10, 11] or discontinuous transitions of anchoring [9], which is not compatible with the model established to interpret observed control of pretilt. In order to be able to predict if bi-stability or continuous combination of the two easy axes occurs for one given system, it becomes necessary to understand the microscopic origin of the easy axes.","(587, 17)","In this paper, we investigate the characteristics and behavior of ordered interfaces in liquid crystals with dual easy axes. This combination of properties is known to induce a number of complex and interesting phenomena, including domain formation, phase transitions, and the emergence of topological defects.

To begin, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of dual easy axes in nematic liquid crystals. We describe the different types of ordering that can occur in these systems, including homogenous and patterned alignments. We also discuss how external fields and boundary conditions can be used to control and manipulate the ordering of the liquid crystal.

We then turn our attention to the experimental study of dual easy axes in liquid crystals. Using a combination of microscopy and scattering techniques, we analyze the structures and dynamics of ordered interfaces. We find that the ordering of the liquid crystal displays a rich variety of behavior, including the formation of complex textures such as stripes and walls.

One particularly interesting phenomenon that arises from the combination of dual easy axes and ordered interfaces is the formation of topological defects. These defects can take on a number of different forms, including disclinations and dislocations, and have been shown to have important implications for the properties and behavior of the liquid crystal.

We also investigate the effect of confined geometries on the ordering of dual easy axes in liquid crystals. By studying the behavior of these systems in thin films and droplets, we are able to gain insight into how the ordering is affected by the presence of surfaces and interfaces. We find that the confinement induces a number of new and unexpected effects, including the formation of new types of topological defects and the emergence of novel phase behavior.

Overall, our study demonstrates that the combination of dual easy axes and ordered interfaces in liquid crystals is a rich and complex field of study with a number of important implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. Our research contributes to a growing body of knowledge on these fascinating systems and paves the way for future research in this area.","(383, 15)","Using nCB films adsorbed on MoS 2 substrates studied by x-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and

Virtualization allows the simulation of automotive ECUs on a Windows PC executing in closed-loop with
","Virtualization allows the simulation of automotive ECUs on a Windows PC executing in closed-loop with a vehicle simulation model. This approach enables to move certain development tasks from road or test rigs and HiL (Hardware in the loop) to PCs, where they can often be performed faster and cheaper. Renault has recently established such a virtualization process for powertrain control software based on Simulink models. If the number of runnables exceeds a threshold (about 1500) the execution of the virtual ECU is no longer straight forward and specific techniques are required. This paper describes the motivation behind a Simulink model based process, the virtualization process and applications of the resulting virtual ECUs. Domain: Critical Transportation Systems Topic: Processes, methods and tools, in particular: virtual engineering and simulation 1. Motivation Since 2010, Renault has established a framework to develop engine control software for Diesel and Gasoline engines [6]. The framework is heavily based on MATLAB/Simulink and the idea of model-based development, which facilitates the carry-over and carry-across of application software between software projects. In the Renault EMS architecture software is composed in to about 20 functions, such as Air System, Combustion etc. A function consists of modules. A module is the smallest testable software unit and contains runnables to be scheduled and executed by the Operating System (Os) of the ECU. The Renault EMS development process includes basically the following steps [5]. 1. Specification of about 200 generic configurable modules per ECU using MATLAB/Simulink. 2. Generation of C code (EMS application software) from all module specifications using MATLAB/Simulink Embedded Coder.

3. MiL (Model in the Loop) test and validation of the resulting executable specifications at module level in a simulated system environment, considering only essential interactions with other modules and system environment. This is essentially a back-to-back test to make sure that the Simulink model of a module and the corresponding production C code show equivalent and intended behaviour. To insure software quality, this step is repeatedly performed with steps 1 and 2, based on the simulation capabilities of MATLAB/Simulink. 4.

Configuration of modules to fit to the specific needs of a software project, such as absence or presence of certain components. 5. Integration of generated configured C code and hand-coded platform software (basic software) on supplied target hardware, a real ECU that communicates with other controllers via CAN and other busses. 6. Validation and test of all modules on system level using the real ECU. In contrast to step 3, the interactions of all modules and interactions with the system environment are visible then and subject to testing. For example, the Os runs all scheduled runnables then, not just those of the modules considered to be 'essential' for a module under test. Critical assessment of the above process shows that there is a considerable delay between delivery of a set of specifications to the software project team (at the end of step 3) and system-level tests based on an ECU that runs entire software (step 6). Typical delays are weeks or months.","(572, 30)","This paper presents a comprehensive study on the full virtualization of Renault's engine management software and its application to system development. The aim of the research is to investigate the feasibility of complete system virtualization for engine control systems, which will allow more flexibility and assess the practicality of this approach for software development in the automotive industry.

To achieve this goal, a detailed analysis of the Renault engine management system architecture is performed, including its various components and sub-systems. This analysis helps identify the key characteristics and features that require consideration when creating a virtualized system.

The research then proposes a virtualization architecture based on various virtualization techniques, such as hardware-level virtualization, kernel-level virtualization, and system-level virtualization. This architecture is designed specifically for Renault's engine management system, taking into account the unique characteristics of the system.

Several virtualization prototypes are developed and implemented on the proposed architecture to identify potential issues in the virtualization process and to evaluate the performance of the virtualized system. The results of these tests show that full virtualization of Renault's engine management software is feasible and can be a promising approach for system development in the automotive industry.

Furthermore, the paper explores the benefits of virtualization in relation to software development and analyzes the potential implications for Renault's development process. The paper highlights the potential for quicker development cycles, improved software testing, and better fault isolation among other benefits. Moreover, through this virtualization, developers can build, test, and deploy various software updates to Renault engines more efficiently.

Finally, the research concludes with an outlook on the future of full virtualization in the automotive industry and potential directions that future research can take. The study builds a fundamental understanding that can serve as a basis for future investigations into virtualization approaches for engine management systems.

Overall, this paper presents a detailed analysis of full virtualization of Renault's engine management software and its application to system development. The results show that virtualization can offer substantial benefits for developers in the automotive industry in terms of software development, testing, and deployment.

One Monad to Prove Them All is a modern fairy tale about curiosity and perseverance,
","One Monad to Prove Them All is a modern fairy tale about curiosity and perseverance, two important properties of a successful PhD student. We follow the PhD student Mona on her adventure of proving properties about Haskell programs in the proof assistant Coq. On the one hand, as a PhD student in computer science Mona observes an increasing demand for correct software products. In particular, because of the large amount of existing software, verifying existing software products becomes more important. Verifying programs in the functional programming language Haskell is no exception. On the other hand, Mona is delighted to see that communities in the area of theorem proving are becoming popular. Thus, Mona sets out to learn more about the interactive theorem prover Coq and verifying Haskell programs in Coq. To prove properties about a Haskell function in Coq, Mona has to translate the function into Coq code. As Coq programs have to be total and Haskell programs are often not, Mona has to model partiality explicitly in Coq. In her quest for a solution Mona finds an ancient manuscript that explains how properties about Haskell functions can be proven in the proof assistant Agda by translating Haskell programs into monadic Agda programs. By instantiating the monadic program with a concrete monad instance the proof can be performed in either a total or a partial setting. Mona discovers that the proposed transformation does not work in Coq due to a restriction in the termination checker. In fact the transformation does not work in Agda anymore as well, as the termination checker in Agda has been improved. We follow Mona on an educational journey through the land of functional programming where she learns about concepts like free monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof assistants like Coq. These concepts are well-known individually, but their interplay gives rise to a solution for Mona's problem based on the originally proposed monadic tranformation that has not been presented before. When Mona starts to test her approach by proving a statement about simple Haskell functions, she realizes that her approach has an additional advantage over the original idea in Agda. Mona's final solution not only works for a specific monad instance but even allows her to prove monad-generic properties. Instead of proving properties over and over again for specific monad instances she is able to prove properties that hold for all monads representable by a container-based instance of the free monad. In order to strengthen her confidence in the practicability of her approach, Mona evaluates her approach in a case study that compares two implementations for queues. In order to share the results with other functional programmers the fairy tale is available as a literate Coq file. If you are a citizen of the land of functional programming or are at least familiar with its customs, had a journey that involved reasoning about functional programs of your own, or are just a curious soul looking for the next story about monads and proofs, then this tale is for you.","(546, 21)","The concept of a ""monad"" has been used across multiple fields and disciplines throughout history, from Western philosophy to computer science. In this paper, we examine the concept of a monad and its applications in various areas of science.

We begin with a historical overview of the term, exploring its origins in the writings of Plato and Aristotle and its development over time. From there, we move into an examination of the ways in which the idea of a monad has been used in mathematics, particularly in calculus and topology.

Moving beyond mathematics, we explore the use of monads in physics, including its application in quantum mechanics and string theory. We also examine the concept of a monad in chemistry, considering its role in the development of new materials and its potential for creating new molecules through precisely controlled reactions.

In the field of computer science, monads have been used as a way to structure functional programming languages. We explore the use of monads in Haskell and Scala, two prominent functional programming languages, and discuss the advantages they provide in terms of code reusability and modularity.

Finally, we consider the potential applications of monads in the field of artificial intelligence. We explore how monads could be used to model complex systems, such as the human brain, and how they could be used to develop more efficient algorithms for machine learning and natural language processing.

Overall, our paper argues that the concept of a monad has far-reaching applications across a variety of scientific disciplines.

In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized function. Choosing a neural network
","In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized function. Choosing a neural network architecture for any task is as complex as searching the space of those functions. For the last few years, 'neural architecture design' has been largely synonymous with 'neural architecture search' (NAS), i.e. brute-force, large-scale search. NAS has yielded significant gains on practical tasks. However, NAS methods end up searching for a local optimum in architecture space in a small neighborhood around architectures that often go back decades, based on CNN or LSTM.

In this work, we present a different and complementary approach to architecture design, which we term 'zero-shot architecture design' (ZSAD). We develop methods that can predict, without any training, whether an architecture will achieve a relatively high test or training error on a task after training.

We then go on to explain the error in terms of the architecture definition itself and develop tools for modifying the architecture based on this explanation. This confers an unprecedented level of control on the deep learning practitioner. They can make informed design decisions before the first line of code is written, even for tasks for which no prior art exists.

Our first major contribution is to show that the 'degree of nonlinearity' of a neural architecture is a key causal driver behind its performance, and a primary aspect of the architecture's model complexity. We introduce the 'nonlinearity coefficient' (NLC), a scalar metric for measuring nonlinearity.

Via extensive empirical study, we show that the value of the NLC in the architecture's randomly initialized state before training is a powerful predictor of test error after training and that attaining a right-sized NLC is essential for attaining an optimal test error. The NLC is also conceptually simple, well-defined for any feedforward network, easy and cheap to compute, has extensive theoretical, empirical and conceptual grounding, follows instructively from the architecture definition, and can be easily controlled via our 'nonlinearity normalization' algorithm. We argue that the NLC is the most powerful scalar statistic for architecture design specifically and neural network analysis in general. Our analysis is fueled by mean field theory, which we use to uncover the 'meta-distribution' of layers.

Beyond the NLC, we uncover and flesh out a range of metrics and properties that have a significant explanatory influence on test and training error. We go on to explain the majority of the error variation across a wide range of randomly generated architectures with these metrics and properties. We compile our insights into a practical guide for architecture designers, which we argue can significantly shorten the trial-and-error phase of deep learning deployment.

Our results are grounded in an experimental protocol that exceeds that of the vast majority of other deep learning studies in terms of carefulness and rigor.

We study the impact of e.g. dataset, learning rate, floating-point precision, loss function, statistical estimation error and batch inter-dependency on performance and other key properties. We promote research practices that we believe can significantly accelerate progress in architecture design research.","(565, 24)","The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been revolutionized by the concept of the nonlinearity coefficient (NLC). The NLC is a measure of the nonlinearity of the activation functions used in the hidden layers of an ANN. The use of an optimal NLC value in designing ANNs can improve their performance by minimizing overfitting and increasing generalization accuracy.

In this paper, we present a practical guide to designing neural architectures using the NLC. We begin with an overview of the fundamental concepts of ANNs and their activation functions. We then introduce the concept of the NLC and explain how it can be determined for a given ANN architecture. 

Next, we present experimental results based on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the NLC in improving the performance of ANNs. We also compare the performance of ANNs designed using the NLC with those designed using other traditional methods, such as regularization and early stopping.

Furthermore, we provide guidelines for selecting an appropriate NLC value based on the complexity of the dataset, the size of the training dataset, and the optimization algorithm used.

Lastly, we discuss the limitations of using the NLC in neural architecture design, such as the high computational cost of calculating NLC and the dependence of the optimal NLC on the dataset and architecture used.

In conclusion, this paper provides a comprehensive guide to using the NLC in neural architecture design. The practical guidelines and experimental results presented here demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating the NLC into the design process to improve the performance of ANNs.","(285, 12)","In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized function.

User-defined syntax extensions are useful to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) with good
","User-defined syntax extensions are useful to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) with good code-readability. They allow EDSL authors to define domain-natural notation, which is often different from the host language syntax. Nowadays, there are several research works of powerful user-defined syntax extensions. One promising approach uses user-defined operators. A user-defined operator is a function with user-defined syntax. It can be regarded as a syntax extension implemented without macros. An advantage of user-defined operators is that an operator can be statically typed. The compiler can find type errors in the definition of an operator before the operator is used. In addition, the compiler can resolve syntactic ambiguities by using static types. However, user-defined operators are difficult to implement language constructs involving static name binding. Name binding is association between names and values (or memory locations). Our inquiry is whether we can design a system for user-defined operators involving a new custom name binding. This paper proposes a module system for user-defined operators named a dsl class. A dsl class is similar to a normal class in Java but it contains operators instead of methods. We use operators for implementing custom name binding. For example, we use a nullary operator for emulating a variable name. An instance of a dsl class, called a dsl object, reifies an environment that expresses name binding. Programmers can control a scope of instance operators by specifying where the dsl object is active. We extend the host type system so that it can express the activation of a dsl object. In our system, a bound name is propagated through a type parameter to a dsl object.

This enables us to implement user-defined language constructs involving static name binding. A contribution of this paper is that we reveal we can integrate a system for managing names and their scopes with a module and type system of an object-oriented language like Java. This allows us to implement a proposed system by adopting eager disambiguation based on expected types so that the compilation time will be acceptable. Eager disambiguation, which prunes out semantically invalid abstract parsing trees (ASTs) while a parser is running, is needed because the parser may generate a huge number of potentially valid ASTs for the same source code. We have implemented ProteaJ2, which is a programming language based on Java and it supports our proposal. We describe a parsing method that adopts eager disambiguation for fast parsing and discuss its time complexity. To show the practicality of our proposal, we have conducted two micro benchmarks to see the performance of our compiler. We also show several use cases of dsl classes for demonstrating dsl classes can express various language constructs. Our ultimate goal is to let programmers add any kind of new language construct to a host language. To do this, programmers should be able to define new syntax, name binding, and type system within the host language. This paper shows programmers can define the former two: their own syntax and name binding.","(552, 31)","This paper discusses the implementation of user-defined operators and name binding for new language constructs. The proposed approach allows programmers to define their own operators, customized to the domain-specific needs of their applications. The main goal is to enable a concise and natural expression of complex operations, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.

The paper presents a formal specification of the syntax and semantics of the proposed extension, and provides a reference implementation based on a modified version of an existing language. The operators are defined using a declarative syntax similar to that of functions or procedures. The syntax specifies the precedence and associativity of the operators, as well as their arity and argument types. The implementation uses a parser generator to automatically generate a parser for the extended grammar.

To enable name binding for user-defined operators, the paper proposes a novel mechanism that uses a combination of dynamic scoping and type inference. The mechanism allows the compiler to infer the types and binding scopes of variables based on their usage within the operator, thus avoiding the need for explicit type annotations or variable declarations. This makes the programming model more expressive and less error-prone, while still preserving type safety and compile-time correctness.

The paper also discusses the benefits and limitations of the proposed approach, and presents several examples of how the new operators can be used to simplify and clarify program logic. The examples include arithmetic and logical operations, string manipulation, and collection processing. The paper concludes with a discussion of future work, including the extension of the mechanism to support user-defined control structures and the integration of the approach into other programming languages. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly enhance the productivity and clarity of software development, particularly for domain-specific applications that require customized operators and abstractions.","(329, 14)","User-defined syntax extensions are useful to implement an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) with good
