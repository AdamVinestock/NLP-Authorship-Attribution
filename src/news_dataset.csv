Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest
","Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest of his Uruguay team-mates on Thursday. England take on Uruguay later this week in what Hart believes is a 'do-or-die' match because of Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Italy. Suarez is back in full training following a knee injury and is expected to start the match at the Itaquerao Stadium. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez looking sharp in training . Prepared: Joe Hart says he is ready for the challenge of Uruguay on Thursday . Suarez enjoyed a prolific year with Liverpool last season, scoring 27 league goals, and Uruguay also have the considerable talents of Diego Forlan and Edinson Cavani to call upon. Hart has been studying videos of all the Uruguay players, though, to make sure he is ready to stop whatever the opposition throws at him on Thursday. 'Dave [Watson, goalkeeping coach] studies the tapes of Uruguay and we are well aware of their strikers and their pattern of finishing,' England's number one told TheFA.com. 'We had a lot of sharp shots around the . box (in training). We cover in general, but we specify short, sharp . shots as they have got a lot of boys who get it out of their feet and . bang it.' England need to beat Uruguay and Costa Rica to guarantee their progression to the knock-out stages. Eyes on the prize: Luis Suarez trained on Tuesday and is expected to be fit to face England . Kicking into gear: Luis Suarez says he is 100 per cent fit to face England after his knee problems . No surprises: Joe Hart has faced Luis Suarez countless times in the Premier League . Head boy: Mario Balotelli (left) scored the winning goal as England lost to Italy last Saturday . A draw and a win could be enough for England to qualify, providing other results go their way, but Hart sees Thursday's game as a must-win. 'We've got to win in Sao Paulo,' said the 27-year-old, who earned his 41st cap in Manaus. 'We did play well (against Italy) and there were a lot of positives, but the outcome was not want we wanted and it's not what we've come here for. 'We've put ourselves in a do-or-die situation, which we are prepared for. We need to win. We didn't go into the Italian game with any intention of losing - it's done now, we've moved on.'","(469, 24)","England goalkeeper Joe Hart has been closely monitoring footage of Uruguay's strikers ahead of their crucial World Cup clash on Thursday. Hart has said that Roy Hodgson's side are fully aware that they must win the match against Uruguay, following their narrow defeat to Italy in their opening game. Hart also revealed that he has been closely studying Uruguay’s forwards, particularly the returning Luis Suarez, who has now resumed full training following an injury. Suarez is expected to start against England, and Hart knows that he and his team-mates will need to be on top form if they are to prevent the world's most in-form striker from finding the net. England's preparations for the Uruguay game have been disrupted by a number of injuries, most notably to captain Steven Gerrard and centre-back Gary Cahill. However, Hart remains confident that Hodgson's side can still secure a crucial victory, despite their injury setbacks. England are also hoping to welcome back Danny Welbeck for the game, after the Manchester United forward missed the opening fixture through injury. Welbeck's pace and energy could prove to be a key asset for England, particularly if they look to exploit the aging Uruguayan defence. However, England will also need to be wary of the threat posed by Uruguay's attacking players, particularly Suarez, who has been in sensational form for Liverpool over the past season. The Liverpool forward, who was named the Premier League's Player of the Year last season, is regarded by many as one of the best strikers in the world. His partnership with Edinson Cavani in particular could prove to be a major problem for England's defence. Despite the challenge facing them, Hart and his team-mates remain determined to secure a much-needed win on Thursday. With the likes of Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Welbeck in their ranks, England certainly have the attacking talent to cause Uruguay problems, and Hart is hopeful that they can produce the goods when it matters most. Of course, everything depends on the form Suarez exibits in the game. If he shows why he is regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, Hart and England’s defence will certainly have a tough time trying to keep him at bay. However, England has some talented forward players, and they will be looking to make the most of the chances that come their way. The match between England and Uruguay promises to be an enthralling encounter, with both sides eager to secure three points and keep their World Cup hopes alive. For Hart and England, it will be a case of remaining focused and organised at the back, while also looking to take advantage of any opportunities that arise in attack.","(507, 18)","Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest

By . Lizzie Parry . Dismayed shoppers in the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells
","By . Lizzie Parry . Dismayed shoppers in the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched as upmarket superstore Waitrose opened new branches across Kent. Stores have opened in Edenbridge, Crowborough, Ramsgate and Maidstone while Sevenoaks is preparing for the opening of their second branch. Even 'downmarket' Tonbridge has their own Waitrose, say angry campaigners. Dismayed shoppers in Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched for years as branches of Waitrose have popped up all across Kent. Residents have written to the firm urging them to open in the spa town, but to no avail . The small town of Edenbridge, population 8,000, welcomed their new Waitrose last month. Meanwhile the 56,500 well-to-do residents of Tunbridge Wells are left facing an eight-mile round trip to their nearest branch. Locals have mounted a campaign, writing to Waitrose to demand it opens a store in the spa town. Richard Shaw, 52, said: 'Every time . there is a whisper about a new shop coming to town, everyone gets their . knickers in a twist thinking it will be Waitrose. 'We've waited long enough, I think it's time the store just did the decent thing and opened a store here.' And Sarah Reed, 42, added: 'I've lived her for my entire life and . have seen Waitrose shops pop up all over the county - but never . anything for Tunbridge Wells. The existing branch of Waitrose in Sevenoaks. Locals in neighbouring Royal Tunbridge Wells are fuming that the town is set to welcome a second store in the coming months . Tunbridge Wells resident Richard Shaw, 52, said: 'We've waited long enough, I think it's time the store just did the decent thing and opened a store here.' Pictured is the Waitrose branch in Ramsgate . 'It's . very, very odd - the people here tend to be quite well off and . discerning, exactly the type of customers Waitrose should be aiming at, . but we don't get a look in. 'Even Dartford and Tonbridge have got one and now Sevenoaks will have two - it's very galling.' She said she had written to Waitrose . detailing other stores around the county which had opened and 'politely . requesting' they look at Tunbridge Wells. Local resident Anke, the voice behind The Royal Tunbridge Wells blog, which was launched in 2005, has spent years questioning whether Waitrose will grace the town with their presence. In 2005 he complained the company was 'making us trek to the next town to buy groceries'. A recent post said: 'We have reason for celebration this week, well if you're a shopper that is. 'No, . calm down, Waitrose hasn't arrived yet, but our main shopping centre . has won the prestigious award of ""Best Shopping Centre in the World"".' A Waitrose spokesman said last week: 'I can assure you we're still keen to bring a Waitrose to Tunbridge Wells, however have nothing further to update at the moment.'","(566, 36)","Residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells are expressing their frustration as Waitrose, a high-end supermarket chain, has chosen not to open a store in their town. Despite the recent opening of several branches across Kent, including a second store in Sevenoaks set to open in the coming months, locals in Royal Tunbridge Wells are feeling snubbed. The absence of a Waitrose in Royal Tunbridge Wells has left residents feeling let down. Many locals were hoping for the popular supermarket chain to open a new store in their town, but it appears their wishes have gone unanswered. Scores of residents took to social media to voice their displeasure at the situation. It is not clear why Waitrose has chosen not to open a branch in the town. However, industry insiders speculate that the relatively small population of Royal Tunbridge Wells, compared to the nearby towns of Sevenoaks and Tonbridge, may be a factor. It is also possible that Waitrose may have taken into account the fact that competitors, such as Sainsbury’s and Tesco, already have a presence in the town. Waitrose is a popular supermarket chain in the UK that is known for its high-quality products and customer service. The absence of a Waitrose store in Royal Tunbridge Wells may inconvenience residents who prefer the chain’s products and services. Some locals have expressed their disappointment and frustration at having to travel to nearby towns to shop at Waitrose. Despite the disappointment, some residents are hopeful that Waitrose may reconsider their decision in the future. The opening of a second store in Sevenoaks may indicate that the chain recognizes the potential for growth in the area. It is also possible that local demand for a Waitrose store in Royal Tunbridge Wells may persuade the company to review their decision. For now, residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells will have to make do with the presence of other supermarket chains in the town. However, the continued absence of a Waitrose store may be a missed opportunity for the company to tap into the affluent market in the town. Waitrose is a popular choice among consumers who are willing to pay a premium for high-quality products, and the town’s high-income demographic could be a lucrative market for the chain. In conclusion, the decision by Waitrose not to open a store in Royal Tunbridge Wells has left residents feeling disappointed and frustrated. However, the opening of a second store in Sevenoaks may provide some hope for those hoping for a Waitrose in their town. Only time will tell whether the popular supermarket chain will reconsider their decision and tap into the potential market in Royal Tunbridge Wells.","(482, 20)","By. Lizzie Parry.

(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by
","(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by 12 months until June 2012, killing off speculation that he could be on his way to Real Madrid. Coach Mourinho has signed an extended deal ending fears he could wave goodbye to Inter Milan. Former Chelsea supremo Mourinho took charge at Italian giants Inter a year ago following the departure of Roberto Mancini and has just guided the club to their fourth straight scudetto. They also won the Italian Super Cup, but were eliminated by defending champions Manchester United in the first knockout round of the Champions League. A statement on the Inter Web site read: ""In response to the wish of the coach to continue the project started together a year ago, a wish welcomed with pleasure by the club as a sign of attachment and winning spirit, FC Internazionale announces the extension of Jose Mourinho's contract until 30 June 2012."" Mourinho had promised the fans more titles would be on the after lifting his first Italian title, but the eal issue refused to go away until Monday's statement. When asked about the chance he could leave Inter, Mourinho had earlier told the club Web site: ""There is still a 0.01% (chance). But for me this is not an important number, it just means that I am closer to Inter than to Real. ""I am satisfied with the relationship with the fans and with my players. I repeat, I am closer to staying at Inter than going elsewhere."" Those comments failed to impress Inter president Massimo Moratti, but the extended contract has settled any differences. Mourinho made his mark at Porto in 2004 when he led the Portuguese team to the Champions League title, beating Monaco 3-0 in the final, before moving to Chelsea. At Stamford Bridge he claimed the Premier League title in each of his first two seasons and the FA Cup the following campaign, but left the club in September 2007. Not all Inter fans have warmed to the Portuguese since his arrival in Milan last summer. He has been involved in several disagreements with the Italian media and his style of play has has not endeared him to parts of the Nerazzurri faithful.","(414, 15)","It's official: Jose Mourinho will remain at the helm of Inter Milan for another couple of years. The Portuguese coach has put pen to paper on a new contract that keeps him at the Italian club until at least 30 June 2012. The decision to extend Mourinho's stay puts an end to months of speculation that he could be lured away to Spanish giants Real Madrid. With the 2008-2009 season culminating in a Serie A, Coppa Italia and Champions League triumph for the Italian club, Mourinho was already being recognized as one of the best coaches in the world. But as rumours swirled about his potential exit to Real Madrid, many Inter fans feared that this glorious chapter in the club's history might come to a premature end. Fortunately for the Nerazzurri faithful, Mourinho has apparently found everything he needs at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. ""I'm happy to confirm that I've signed an extension to my contract with Inter,"" he said in a statement. ""I have a great relationship with both the club and the fans, and I'm excited about the challenges that lie ahead."" Under Mourinho's leadership, Inter Milan have become a force to be reckoned with in Italian and European football. The Special One, as he likes to call himself, has raised the bar for Inter's domestic rivals, and has instilled a winning mentality in his players that was previously lacking. The result has been a remarkable run of success which could yet extend further, with Inter looking to defend their titles in Serie A, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League. The news that Mourinho will not be leaving for Real Madrid will come as a tremendous relief for Inter supporters. For many, the prospect of losing a coach of Mourinho's stature and pedigree was simply unthinkable. Now, with the Portuguese mastermind committed to staying in Milan, the club can look forward to a bright future and more success under his guidance. It remains to be seen, however, whether Mourinho's decision to stay with Inter will put an end to the speculation about his future. The rumour mill never sleeps, and other elite clubs may well be looking enviously at what the Portuguese coach has achieved in Italy. For now though, Inter Milan can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that their Special One will be with them for the foreseeable future.","(447, 17)","(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by

A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning . A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning. Blanc Brasserie in London's Covent Garden has been forbidden from offering pink lamb's liver after ignoring a warning from Westminster Council environmental health officers. The food presented an 'imminent risk of injury to health' because of the way it was cooked, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told today. French-born Mr Blanc, 62, is a director of the company that owns the restaurant. James Armitage, Westminster City Council's food, health and safety manager, said: 'After receiving two separate complaints of food poisoning which may have originated from eating at a Covent Garden restaurant, our officers investigated and issued a notice which prevented the restaurant from serving undercooked lambs' liver. 'Today's court decision to uphold the notice is welcome as the serving of undercooked meat, without suitable controls in place, is a public health risk. 'Health inspectors have agreed with the restaurant the safety measures that need to be in place for the restaurant to be allowed to safely put the dish back on its menu.' The two diners contracted campylobacter food poisoning after they had the dish on separate occasions this summer. Guidance from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) recommends that lamb's liver must be cooked at 70 degrees centigrade for at least two minutes. But the Brasserie Bar Co. said it had taken liver off the menu at all 18 of its Blanc Brasserie restaurants throughout Britain after it was ordered to pay £3,103 in costs. A spokeswoman said: 'Brasserie Bar Co. has not contested the environmental health officers' enforcement and will no longer serve liver in any of its restaurants. 'In order to serve liver and comply with Westminster Council, it would need to be overcooked to such an extent that our customers just won't eat it.' Mr Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons restaurant in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, was awarded two Michelin stars in 1985. There were more than 371,000 estimated cases of campylobacter food poisoning in England and Wales in 2009, resulting in more than 17,500 hospitalisations and 88 deaths, according to the FSA.

The restaurant, which is owned and directed by French-born chef Raymond Blanc, 62, was recently visited by environmental health officers after two diners complained of severe food poisoning. The diners had fallen ill with campylobacter, a type of bacteria commonly found in undercooked chicken or other poultry. Despite the warning from the health officers, Blanc Brasserie failed to take any immediate action to rectify their food safety procedures. Instead, the restaurant's management chose to carry on business as usual, putting the health and safety of their customers at risk. The situation at Blanc Brasserie has raised concerns among food safety experts, who warn that ignoring warnings from environmental health officers can have serious consequences. According to experts, failing to take prompt action can lead to the spread of foodborne illness among customers, potentially causing long-lasting health problems and possible legal action. The situation at Blanc Brasserie is particularly concerning given the restaurant's high-end reputation and status as a popular destination for foodies in London. Many of the restaurant's customers are passionate about their food and expect a top-quality dining experience, which includes food safety and hygiene standards that are beyond reproach. Raymond Blanc is a well-known figure in the culinary world, having appeared on numerous TV shows and written several cookbooks. He is also a staunch advocate for sustainable and ethical food practices. The fact that his restaurant seemingly ignored warnings from environmental health officers has raised eyebrows among his fans and supporters. Although the restaurant has not yet issued a statement about the situation, it is likely that the management will face significant backlash from customers and food safety advocates alike. It remains to be seen what steps they will take to rectify the issues raised by the environmental health officers. This incident serves as a reminder to all restaurants and food establishments about the importance of prioritizing food safety and hygiene. Ignoring warnings from experts can have serious health and legal repercussions, which can ultimately harm not only customers but businesses themselves. It is crucial that all food establishments take proactive measures to ensure that their products are safe and healthy for consumption.","(417, 17)","By. Leon Watson.

Two diners fell ill after eating at a top London restaurant run by celebrity chef Marco Pierre White, it has emerged.
Blanc Brasserie, which is owned by the French-born chef, 62, was visited by environmental health officers after two diners complained they had been struck down with campylobacter – a type of food poisoning caused by bacteria found in raw meat, poultry, eggs and unpasteurised milk.
A spokesman for Westminster City Council said: ‘We received a complaint from a member of the public that they had suffered from food poisoning after eating at the restaurant.
‘Environmental health officers visited the premises and issued a hygiene improvement notice.’
The notice, which was issued on October 31, requires the restaurant to take action to improve its hygiene standards within 28 days.
It is not known whether the two diners who fell ill ate at the restaurant on the same day.
A spokesman for the restaurant said: ‘We can confirm that we received a hygiene improvement notice from Westminster City Council on October 31.
‘We are working closely with the council to address the issues raised in the notice.’
Marco Pierre White, who was the youngest chef to be awarded three Michelin stars at the age of 33, opened Blanc Brasserie in Covent Garden in 2009.
He is also a director of the restaurant, according to Companies House records.

Marshawn Farr-Robbins, from St. Paul, Minnesota, was playing with friends when he attempted to climb on to a slow moving train.
He slipped and fell under the wheels of the train, which ran over his feet, cutting them off.
Marshawn was rushed to the Gillette Children’s Hospital in St. Paul, where he remains in a stable condition.
His family have asked for their privacy to be respected as they come to terms with what has happened.
St. Paul police spokesman Sgt. Mike Ernster said: ‘It’s a very sad situation. It’s just a tragic accident.’
Ernster said the incident happened around 6.30pm on Tuesday evening.
He said: ‘We don’t know why he was trying to get on the train. We don’t know if he was trying to play on the train or if he wanted to ride the train.
‘We don’t know if it was a spur of the moment thing or if he had been thinking about it for a while.’
He added: ‘I don’t think we’ll ever know why he did what he did.’
Marshawn’s family have set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to help pay for his medical bills.
The page reads: ‘On August 13, 2013, our son Marshawn Farr Robbin’s life changed forever.

Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to
","Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to play in the Champions League next season. The rules now effectively set up a scenario where rivals can claim City have cheated their way to passing UEFA’s ‘Financial Fair Play’ (FFP) test. It is understood lawyers for a host of ‘major clubs’ are aware of these potential rights to make appeals — thanks to recently amended Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations — and are monitoring the situation closely. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho question the fairness of FFP . Expensive squad: But could Manchester City's big-spending ways cost them a Champions League place? On Saturday night Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who faces City on Monday in the game of the season so far, accused some unnamed clubs of ‘dodgy FFP’. He said: ‘There are clubs that are following exactly the project of Financial Fair Play and there are other clubs doing it in a dodgy way. For me, that is very clear. I don’t say the clubs — that is not my job.’ When asked specifically about City, and a potential UEFA investigation, he added: ‘It’s for Mr Platini and other people to analyse it, it’s not for me… I’m waiting for that.’ Financial force: Manchester City's spending power is among the greatest in football . 'Dodgy FFP'? Jose Mourinho was critical, but he manages another expensive squad at Chelsea . Concern? Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has a proven track record in the Champions League . FFP rules compel clubs to limit losses for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons combined to £37million, with a ban from European competitions the severest theoretical punishment. City last week announced losses for 2012-13 of £51.6m, meaning they have lost £149.5m over two years. They can perhaps ‘exempt’ as much as £110m of those losses to meet FFP requirements. But they face accusations their losses are artificially low after earning cash from ‘intellectual property’ sales to related companies. UEFA sources have confirmed this will be investigated to see if it is ‘real’ income. Amended small print in the 2014 UEFA FFP rulebook, just published, includes two key changes; one allowing clubs to ‘plea bargain’ punishments for overspending, and another that allows other clubs to challenge those plea bargains if they feel the outcomes negatively affect them. Time to celebrate? Liverpool are one of the clubs not in a position to compete with City's financial muscle . Title rivals: Arsenal could be another team to benefit if City are to face a form of punishment . Money well spent: The signings of players like Sergio Aguero have turned City into a real force .","(520, 23)","The eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League has been thrown into doubt due to a small print in the Financial Fair Play (FFP) rule of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). This has caused concern among the club's supporters, who are worried about the possibility of their beloved team being disqualified from the coveted tournament. The FFP was established to promote financial stability and fair competition among football clubs in Europe. It requires clubs to balance their books and avoid huge debts as a result of excessive spending on players and other expenses. The rule has been hailed as a success by UEFA, but in recent times, some clubs have been accused of flouting the regulation. One such club is Manchester City, which has been embroiled in a long-standing controversy over its financial dealings. The club was fined €30 million and banned from participating in the Champions League for two years by UEFA after it was found guilty of breaching the FFP rule. However, the club appealed the decision and managed to overturn the ban after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Now, the eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League has been thrown into doubt once again due to a small print in the FFP rule. According to reports, the rule states that if any club is found to have breached the FFP rule, it will not only face penalties but also lose its right to appeal against any decision made by UEFA's Adjudicatory Chamber. This has caused concern among the club's supporters, who fear that Manchester City could fall afoul of the rule and lose its right to appeal. The club's manager, Pep Guardiola, has sought to allay fears, saying that he is confident that the club is complying with the FFP rule. However, not everyone is convinced. Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has accused unnamed clubs of engaging in ""dodgy FFP."" He claims that ""major clubs"" are being denied the right to appeal against those clubs that cheat their way to passing the FFP test. The controversy over the FFP rule and Manchester City's eligibility for the Champions League has sparked a wider debate about the regulation itself. Some critics argue that the rule is too restrictive and unfair to clubs that are trying to compete with wealthier rivals. They say that it places an unnecessary burden on clubs and discourages investment in the sport. Others, however, believe that the FFP rule is necessary to promote financial stability and ensure that clubs are not consumed by debt. They argue that without the rule, football could become dominated by a handful of wealthy clubs with limitless resources, which would be detrimental to the sport as a whole. For now, the eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League remains in doubt. The club's supporters will be anxiously watching to see how the situation develops in the coming months, hoping that their team will not be denied the opportunity to compete for one of the biggest prizes in European football.","(573, 22)","Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to

Jose Mourinho has accused unnamed clubs of “dodgy” financial fair play (FFP) and claimed that “major
clubs” are away of a potential right to appeal against those who have been found to have cheated their
way to passing the FFP test.
UEFA’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations were introduced in 2011 to prevent clubs from spending
beyond their means. The rules stipulate that clubs must break even over a three-year period, which
means they cannot spend more than they earn.
However, there is a small print in the FFP rule that could affect Manchester City’s eligibility for the
Champions League next season. The rule states that if a club is found to have cheated its way to
passing the FFP test, it can be banned from participating in European competitions for up to four
years. This means that if Manchester City is found to have breached the FFP rules, it could be banned
from participating in the Champions League for up to four years.
Arsenal, Chelsea, and Liverpool could use this small print to challenge Man City’s right to participate in
the Champions League next season. They could argue that Man City has cheated its way to passing the
FFP test and should therefore be banned from competing in European competitions.
Jose Mourinho has also weighed in on the FFP debate, accusing unnamed clubs of using “dodgy”
methods to pass the FFP test. He claimed that “major clubs” are aware of the potential right to appeal
against those who have cheated their way through the FFP process.
Mourinho’s comments come as no surprise, as he has been a vocal critic of the FFP rules in the past.
He has argued that the rules are too strict and unfairly punish clubs that are trying to compete at the
highest level. However, his latest comments suggest that he may be willing to use the small print in
the FFP rule to challenge Man City.
It remains to be seen whether Arsenal, Chelsea, or Liverpool will take action against Man City. However,
if they do, it could have a significant impact on the future of the Premier League and the Champions
League.","(434, 16)","Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to

Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time
","Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time with their children, saying: ‘You can’t be a great mum and keep working all the time.’ The actress recently put her Hollywood career on hold of 12 months to look after her children ... but with a wealth estimated at about £30 million, she is better placed than most to be able to afford the time off.

The award-winning actor who has a 14-year-old daughter named Gaia and a 26-year-old adopted son named Tindyebwa Agaba, spoke candidly about her struggles as a working mother in a recent interview. Weisz, who is known for her roles in major blockbusters such as The Mummy and The Constant Gardener, revealed that it has not always been easy for her to find a balance between her professional life and her responsibilities as a parent. The star admitted that there were moments when she had to make tough decisions and even turn down work opportunities because she wanted to ensure that she was there for her children. ""I don't think I've juggled anything. It's about the choices you make,"" Weisz said. ""I've made some films and turned down some films. It's about the decisions you make in your life, which is a balance."" Weisz's daughter, Gaia, was born in 2006, and so far, the actor has managed to keep her family out of the spotlight, a feat that is not often achieved by other high-profile celebrities. The actor, however, revealed that she has intentionally kept her family out of the media, citing the need for privacy and space. The actor further admitted that the entertainment industry can be unforgiving to working parents, especially mothers, who might be seen as less dedicated to their careers. Weisz confessed that she had to take a break from acting to dedicate her time to parenting before returning to the industry with renewed energy. Despite the challenges, Weisz appears to have found a balance between her professional and personal life, while also raising her children to be successful in their chosen paths. Her adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba is a Harvard graduate and a human rights activist, while her daughter Gaia is pursuing her interests in art and design. In conclusion, Rachel Weisz's story is a testament to the challenges that working mothers face, particularly when in the public eye, and how just like any parent, they must make difficult choices, but with the right balance, they can achieve success both in their professional and personal lives.","(425, 15)","Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time

","Dani Vallverdu is to coach Tomas Berdych following his departure from Andy Murray's team. The Venezuelan became friends with Murray during their time together at the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona and had worked with the Scot for the past five years. Murray announced last month that Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green had left the team, describing the split as 'mutual' in a short statement. Dani Vallverdu (right) works with Andy Murray on the practice court at this year's French Open in Paris . Vallverdu's role in Murray's team increased under Ivan Lendl but the 28-year-old found himself taking a step back when Amelie Mauresmo succeeded Lendl as coach in the summer. Vallverdu has wasted no time finding a new job, and landing a lead coaching position with world No 7 Berdych shows the high regard in which he is held. In a statement on his Facebook page, Berdych said: 'Dear fans and friends ...my new coach for next year will be Danny Vallverdu and Azuz Simcich...thank you to Tomas Krupa and David Vydra for great time and fantastic work.' World No 7 Tomas Berdych in action for the Singapore Slammers at the International Premier Tennis League . Berdych began working with fellow Czech Krupa in 2009 but had been searching for a new influence after seeing most of his rivals appoint big-name coaches. Lendl was his number one choice but the eight-time grand slam champion has so far resisted attempts to lure him back into coaching on the tour. It seems very likely, however, that Lendl's appreciation for Vallverdu's talents will have played a part in Berdych's decision. Murray, who is currently at his pre-season training camp in Miami, intends to appoint a replacement for Vallverdu to work alongside Mauresmo . Vallverdu (right) sits in the stands alongside Murray's former coach Ivan Lendl at the 2012 US Open .","(344, 13)","After five years of coaching Andy Murray, Venezuelan tennis coach Dani Vallverdu has officially parted ways with the British No.1. Vallverdu joined Murray's coaching team back in 2010 and played an instrumental role in the Scot's career - particularly during his two Grand Slam wins at the US Open (2012) and Wimbledon (2013). While it may be a difficult farewell for the two, Vallverdu has now ventured onward to new opportunities. It has been announced that he will now coach Czech world No. 7 Tomas Berdych. It was Berdych's previous coach, Tomas Krupa, who dropped the surprising news on Twitter last week. Vallverdu will take over as Berdych's head coach and will start working with him in January. This is a huge coup for Berdych; Vallverdu's experience in coaching high-calibre players speaks for itself. Before working with Murray he was part of Grigor Dimitrov's team and the Bulgarian player saw his ranking go from world No. 60 to No. 8. It's clear that Vallverdu has the ability to develop players and help them elevate their game to the next level. Berdych must be feeling confident about the appointment. A consistent top 10 player for many years now, he's enjoyed some incredible wins such as making the Wimbledon final back in 2010 and reaching the semi-finals of the Australian Open and French Open. But Vallverdu's track record may just be what he needs to get over those final hurdles and possibly even win his first Grand Slam title. As for Murray, there's no official news on who will replace Vallverdu in his coaching team. The British No. 1 has had a tough time of late, failing to reach his previous heights in the ranking and it's no secret that he needs to make some changes in the near future. Whether that change will come in the form of a new coach remains to be seen.","(356, 19)","Dani Vallverdu is to coach Tomas Berdych following his departure from Andy Murray's team. The

","By . Joshua Gardner . Tragic: Pregnant mother of four Sarah Harkins of Fredericksburg, Virgina died Monday following an allergic reaction to bee stings . A pregnant Virginia mother is dead and her husband left to care for their four children after bee stings brought about her untimely end. Sarah Harkins, 32, lost consciousness Monday after a wasp nest was disturbed in her yard. Paramedics were soon able to revive her, but the tragedy continued when an aneurysm lingering in her brain dislodged during the trauma. Harkins' husbamd Eric must now raise their four children, one of whom was born with Down Syndrome, on his own. 'I’m . thankful to the medic for giving me and the kids that chance, bringing . her back enough so we could say goodbye to her,' Eric told the Free . Lance-Star. The two met while on a mission trip when both attended a Catholic university in Ohio and married in 2005. Their fifth child, a girl they'd named Cecilia Rachel, would have been born this winter. Sarah was 21 weeks pregnant. 'Her . passing was so tough, because I love her so much. She’s a gift that was . given from God, he knows that I needed her, and she was this amazing . gift,' the grief stricken husband and father said. Their . youngest child Faustina, 1, was born with Down Syndrome. Relatives say . they worry that the parenting will be too much for Eric. 'With . Sarah gone, Eric is not equipped to do this by himself,' Sarah's . brother Tom Schulzetenberg told NBC Washington. 'It's something that you . never really prepare for. We're doing our best to hold each other up.' Scroll down for video . Moments of hope: Sarah was 21 weeks pregnant and actually was able to be revived by paramedics . One . way Eric's family, as well as one coworker, have helped is by raising . funds for the children to one day get a 'faith-based education' among . other pricey future needs. 'Sarah’s . absence leaves a massive gap in the lives of these children,' a reads a . message on their YouCaring.com fundraiser. 'Sarah’s husband Eric will . need assistance in fulfilling his wife’s wishes for the children to have . a faith-based education, continue on a wholesome and natural diet, and . support a special needs child.' As . of Thursday, the YouCaring page had raised nearly $40,000. Another . fundraiser on GoFundMe had done even better, having raised an . astonishing $100,000 in just two days. According to her obituary, Sarah is survived by her husband, Eric, their four children: Liam, 7, Analee, 5, Jude, 3, and Faustina, 1, her mother and father and six siblings.

Reports indicate that Harkins was stung by a nest of bees, which led to her untimely death. The incident occurred when Harkins was out in her garden, and the bees were disturbed. The sting was powerful enough to revive her after paramedics arrived, but it also caused a lingering aneurysm in her brain to dislodge, leading to her death. Harkins' sudden demise has left her husband, Eric, and their four children devastated. The youngest child was born with Down Syndrome, making the death of their mother even more challenging for the family to cope with. Friends and family remember Harkins as a devoted mother who loved spending time with her children, especially in their garden. Besides being a hands-on mother, she was also a member of the local school board and was highly involved in the community. As news of Harkins' death spread, many in the Fredericksburg community expressed shock and sadness. One local resident, Grace Simmons, said, ""I can't believe this happened to Sarah. She was such a beautiful person inside and out, and her family meant everything to her. It's just terrible."" Simmons also pointed out that Harkins' death illustrates how even the most ordinary of activities can lead to tragic consequences. The Fredericksburg community has rallied around the Harkin family, organizing fundraisers to help support them in this difficult time. A GoFundMe page was also set up to raise money for funeral expenses and to provide support to the family in the long term. The outpouring of support from the community has provided some comfort to Eric Harkins and his children, as they come to terms with this unimaginable loss. The local police department has urged residents to stay vigilant when dealing with bees or wasps. They emphasized the importance of contacting professionals to take care of nests and to avoid disturbing them. Often, individuals mistakenly think they can handle a bee or wasp problem without professional help, which can lead to serious consequences, as seen in the Harkins case. The tragic passing of Sarah Harkins is a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment with loved ones. The outpouring of support from the Fredericksburg community shows how even in the darkest of times, people can come together and support each other. Our condolences go out to the Harkins family, and we hope they find peace and comfort in the memories of Sarah's life.","(474, 22)","By. Joshua Gardner.

Congratulations! Your article meets the requirements for length and sentence count.
However, there are a few areas where you can improve your writing to make it more engaging
and effective.
Firstly, consider using more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture for your readers.
For example, instead of simply stating that Sarah Harkins “died tragically,” you could say
that she “passed away peacefully in her sleep” or “succumbed to her injuries after a heroic
effort by paramedics to save her life.”
Secondly, try to vary your sentence structure to keep your writing from becoming monotonous.
Instead of using only simple sentences, mix in some compound and complex sentences to add
variety and depth to your writing.
Finally, remember to proofread your work carefully before submitting it. Typos and grammatical
errors can detract from the quality of your writing and make it harder for your readers to
understand your message.
With these tips in mind, I’m confident that you can continue to improve your writing skills
and produce high-quality articles that engage and inform your readers. Keep up the good work!","(339, 17)","By . Joshua Gardner . Tragic: Pregnant mother of four Sarah Harkins of Fredericksburg, Virgina
Sarah Harkins, a 32-year-old mother of four, died Monday after being stung by a nest of honeybees.
Harkins, who was pregnant with her fifth child at the time of the incident, was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead.
According to her husband, Eric Harkins, the incident occurred when a beehive in their backyard was disturbed and the bees stung Harkins in the head.
“It was a freak accident,” Harkins said. “The bees had built a nest in a tree in our backyard, and we had no idea they were there.”
“Sarah was a wonderful mother and wife,” Harkins added. “She was the best person I’ve ever known, and I’m going to miss her so much.”

(CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday.
","(CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday. But even though it took him eight hours, he had every reason to beam. By completing the 26.2 mile course, Singh -- nicknamed the Turbaned Tornado -- became the oldest undisputed runner to finish a marathon. He is 100. Singh, born in rural India in 1911, did not start running marathons until he was 89, after he moved to England following the death of his wife and son. He's completed eight now. ""He says no one is forcing him to do it. It's his desire to do it,"" coach and translator Harmander Singh said Sunday in an interview with CNN affiliate CBC. ""He wanted to do one when he's 100 and today's the day."" Singh was a colorful sight as he started the race in his canary yellow turban and a matching T-shirt with the words "" Sikhs in the City"" printed across its front -- a nod to his faith. He finished more than six hours behind winner Kenneth Mungara of Kenya, who won the event for the fourth straight year. Then again, Mungara is only 38. Singh, the centenarian, already held the World Record for the 90-plus age group, completing the same race in 2003 at age 92. But until now, the title of ""oldest"" was the cause of some debate. The Association of Road Racing Statistician already recognized Singh as the oldest for a marathon he ran at age 93. But the Guinness Book of World Records listed someone else -- Dimitrion Yordanidis, 98, who ran in Athens in 1976. Singh says his secret is a life without alcohol and smoking, a vegetarian diet of curries and tea, and daily exercise. He walks or runs up to 10 miles a day. ""I have said it before: that I will carry on running, as it is keeping me alive,"" Singh told the marathon website.","(374, 19)","At 105 years old, Fauja Singh has become the oldest person to successfully complete a full marathon. The veteran runner achieved this feat by finishing the Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday, his eighth marathon at the age of 89. Born in rural India in 1911, Singh took up running later in life after suffering the loss of his wife and son. Since then, he has become known for his athleticism and perseverance.  Singh’s latest marathon took him six hours and nine minutes to complete, finishing in the 11,000th place overall. When asked how he felt about breaking his own record as the oldest marathoner, Singh replied, “I’m very happy, very happy.” His accomplishment has inspired many, especially those who are often told they are too old to try new things. Singh believes that age is just a number and that people can achieve anything if they have the determination to try.  Despite his age, Singh lives an active lifestyle, taking daily walks in London, where he resides. He also maintains a healthy diet consisting of oats, tea, and ginger curry. Singh is an inspiration to many, showing that it’s never too late to start a new hobby or pursue a passion.  Singh’s journey to becoming a marathon runner started in 2000 when he moved to London to be with his family. There, he discovered his love for long-distance running and eventually joined a running group. He completed his first marathon in 2003 at the age of 92 and has been chasing records ever since.  Singh’s achievements have earned him numerous accolades throughout his running career, including the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award from the Punjab Sports Journalists Association. He has also been recognized by the Guinness World Records as the oldest marathon runner in the world.  As Singh approaches his 106th birthday later this year, he shows no signs of slowing down. He plans to continue his active lifestyle, encouraging others to pursue their passions, no matter how old they may be. Singh’s message is simple: age should never be a barrier to achieving one’s dreams.","(400, 18)","(CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday.

Singh, who was born in Punjab, India, in 1911, has completed eight marathons since he started running at the age of 89. He ran his first marathon in 2000, when he was 89 years old.
Singh took up running as a way to cope with the loss of his wife and his son, who both died within a year of each other in the late 1990s, according to his website.
Singh said he hopes to inspire others to take up running, no matter how old they are.
""I want to show people that it's never too late to start something new,"" he said in a statement. ""I hope that my story will inspire others to get out there and try something new, even if they think they're too old to do it.""
Singh said he plans to continue running as long as he can.
""I don't know how much longer I'll be able to run, but as long as I'm able to, I'll keep doing it,"" he said.","(273, 12)","(CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday.

(CNN) -- French Open champion Francesca Schiavone crashed out of Wimbledon in the first round
","(CNN) -- French Open champion Francesca Schiavone crashed out of Wimbledon in the first round after losing in three sets to unseeded Russian Vera Dushevina. Schiavone of Italy, seeded fifth at the All England Club, went down 6-7 7-5 6-1 to a player who has never been beyond the second round at Wimbledon. It was Schiavone's second straight first round exit since the capture of her first grand slam title at Roland Garros earlier in June. Dushevina, ranked 56, lost the first set but grew in confidence as the match went on, racing into a 5-0 lead in the decider and clinching the victory in two hours, 54 minutes. ""It was a tough match on a different surface with a different feeling,"" Schiavone told reporters. ""But she played very well and I didn't take my chance in the second set."" Who can stop Williams sisters? Elsewhere, Kim Clijsters thrashed unseeded Italian Maria Elena Camerin 6-0 6-3 in her first appearance at Wimbledon since 2006. Clijsters of Belgium, who came out of retirement in 2009, wrapped up the first set in just 24 minutes on Court Two. And although the Italian fought hard in the second, the eighth seed did not face a single break point as she won in 65 minutes. Clijsters will next face Croatia's Karolina Sprem, who beat American qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-3 6-4. Meanwhile, five-time champion Venus Williams cruised into the second round with a 6-3 6-2 win over Paraguay's Rossana De Los Rios. ""It's good to be back. I love playing on the grass,"" Williams said. ""It was pretty straightforward out there but it's just the first round and I'll try to play better with each match."" In other results, Justine Henin of Belgium beat Latvia's Anastasija Sevastova 6-4 6-3, Marion Bartoli of France, the 2007 finalist, beat Julia Goerges 6-4 6-3 and there were wins for Russians Nadia Petrova, Vera Zvonareva and Maria Kirilenko. It was a disappointing day for the home nation with British women Laura Robson, Elena Baltacha and Melanie South all beaten on day one. Robson went down 6-3 7-6 to fourth seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia, Baltacha lost to Croatia's Petra Martic in three sets 2-6 7-5 6-3 and wildcard South was beaten 6-1 6-2 by Regina Kulikova of Russia.","(437, 18)","The first day of Wimbledon saw some surprising results, as well as some expected wins. French Open champion, Francesca Schiavone, suffered a shock defeat against Russian player Vera Dushevina.

Meanwhile, former world number one, Kim Clijsters, made a successful return to Wimbledon, winning her first match since 2006. Clijsters, who has won four Grand Slam titles, only dropped three games in her match against Maria Elena Camerin. The Belgian player looked in excellent form and will be one to watch as the tournament progresses. Five-time Wimbledon champion, Venus Williams, also advanced to the second round after beating Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan in straight sets. Williams, who has struggled with injuries over the past year, seemed to be back to her best and will no doubt be aiming for a sixth Wimbledon title. Former world number one, Justine Henin, also had a successful start to the tournament, beating Kristina Barrois of Germany in straight sets. Henin, who won the French Open in 2010, is looking to add another Grand Slam title to her collection and will be hoping to make a deep run into the tournament. However, it was not all good news for British fans, as all three of their female players lost on the first day of the tournament. Elena Baltacha, Laura Robson, and Melanie South all suffered defeats, crushing the hopes of the home crowd. Baltacha, who had been awarded a wildcard into the tournament, lost to Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic, while Robson was beaten by Jarmila Gajdosova of Australia. South, who is making her comeback from injury, lost to Maria Kirilenko of Russia. Overall, the first day of Wimbledon provided some thrilling matches and a mix of expected and surprising results.

(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin
","(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin Raphel in October as part of a counterintelligence investigation, three U.S. government officials told CNN. As part of the investigation, Raphel's State Department office was searched and sealed, two of the officials said. It's unclear whether she is the target of the investigation, or what agents were searching for. The officials said it is an ongoing investigation and no charges have been filed. The investigation was first reported by The Washington Post. ""We are aware of this law enforcement matter. The State Department has been cooperating with our law enforcement colleagues,"" State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said. Psaki added that Raphel is ""no longer a department employee."" At the time of the raid, Raphel, a retired career Foreign Service officer, was an adviser on Pakistan under a limited, renewable contract to the State Department's Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, where she administered nonmilitary aid and economic grants. It is unclear, however, whether the inquiry is related to her work on Pakistan. Senior State Department officials said Raphel's security clearance was pulled last month, at which time she was placed on administrative leave. Her contract, which expired on November 2, was not renewed. The officials describe the investigation as a counterintelligence investigation, which typically refers to allegations of spying on behalf of foreign governments. Officials declined to describe the exact nature of the investigation. Raphel, the former assistant secretary of state for South Asia and ambassador to Tunisia, spent much of her career working on Pakistan and South Asia. Raphel was well-liked and respected by her colleagues and often outspoken about what she saw as flaws with U.S. policy toward Pakistan. Raphel's State Department biography says she began her career as a CIA analyst before serving 30 years in the Foreign Service. She retired from the State Department in 2005, but returned in 2009 to work as an adviser to the late Richard Holbrooke, appointed by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the first special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. CNN attempted to contact Raphel, but messages have not been returned.","(407, 19)","Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin Raphel, who was working for the State Department, is under scrutiny after her office and home were searched on suspicion of sharing sensitive information with Pakistan. According to officials, her security clearance has been pulled and her contract has not been renewed. Raphel, 67, has had a long and successful career in government service, serving over three decades in several government agencies. She was appointed as the State Department's first Coordinator for Counterterrorism in 1994 and she has since worked as U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia, Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs and as a senior advisor to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Pakistan has long been accused of providing safe havens to terrorist groups and the U.S. has been dependent on Pakistan for its war in Afghanistan. Raphel's expertise in U.S.-Pakistan relations made her an important player in shaping U.S. policy towards the country. However, the search in her office and home has raised alarm bells, as officials suspect that she may have shared classified information with Pakistan. The search was conducted by the FBI and the Diplomatic Security Service, which investigates allegations of misconduct by State Department employees. Raphel has not been charged with any crime, and it is unclear what evidence the investigators may have found. In a statement, the State Department said they were cooperating with the investigation and that they take allegations of misconduct seriously. Raphel has been a controversial figure in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship, with some accusing her of being too sympathetic to Pakistan's interests. In the past, she has advocated for closer ties between the two countries and has praised Pakistan's efforts to combat terrorism. Her removal from her position at the State Department could signal a shift in U.S. policy towards Pakistan, as the Trump administration has taken a more hostile stance towards the country. In August, the U.S. announced that it would withhold $300 million in military aid to Pakistan over its failure to take action against terrorist groups. The investigation into Raphel's activities could also have wider implications for the State Department, which has been under scrutiny for its handling of classified information. The controversy surrounding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure has raised questions about the department's security protocols. For now, the investigation into Raphel's activities continues, and her future in government service remains uncertain.","(446, 18)","(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin
Raphel on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the investigation.
Raphel, who served as assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs from 1997 to 2000, was working for the State Department as a consultant when the search took place, the source said.
Her security clearance had been pulled and her contract with the State Department had not been renewed, the source said. It was not immediately clear why her security clearance was pulled.

Raphel's home was searched as part of an ongoing investigation into whether classified information was mishandled, a law enforcement official told CNN. The official did not provide further details about the nature of the investigation.

Raphel served as U.S. ambassador to Tunisia from 1987 to 1991. She also served as deputy assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs from 1985 to 1987, according to her State Department biography.","(211, 11)","(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin

Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball
","Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball bat . A pregnant woman who was beaten to death by her boyfriend who assaulted with a baseball bat has died, but not before giving birth to a baby girl. Police say 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco, who was originally from Mexico, was pronounced dead on Wednesday morning after being violently assaulted at her trailer park home in Delaware. Miss Polanco was found by paramedics and died just hours later from her injuries. Before she died, she gave birth to a baby girl who was born three months premature. The newborn is listed in critical but stable condition at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. Police were called to the home in the Waterford Trailer Park after paramedics found the woman unconscious inside the home. Investigators claim Paula's injuries were caused  by 24-year-old Fernando Flores who assaulted her. Flores was arrested that same day and charged with assault, although the charges have now been elevated to that of manslaughter. He is now in the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution awaiting trial. Miss Polanco (left) was found by paramedics and died just hours later from her injuries. Fernando Flores (right) was arrested that same day and charged with assault, although the charges have now been elevated to that of manslaughter . Paola's family in Puente de Camotlan in Mexico are hoping that people may be able to donate to help bring her body back to her home country. They have set up a page which they also hope will help to raise some funds to help care for her  newborn baby girl which the family will now look after. So far the page has raised $1,095. The fundraising page reads: 'Paola Eden Delagado Polanco was a young thriving girl and full of life, with charming simplicity and humility. 'She died October 29 at her 21 years as a victim of domestic violence. Paola was six months pregnant, and by a miracle the baby survived. God has plans for all of us and Paola is now in the kingdom of heaven with our Heavenly Father. She was beautiful, but her inner beauty was far more radiant than her physical attractiveness. 'We urge support for funeral expenses and to send her body to rest in her home town of Puente de Camotlan Nayarit, Mexico. We also ask for your help in the expenses for her premature baby girl who has a long journey ahead of her. Thank you and may God bless you.'","(464, 23)","Tragedy struck a family in Newark, New Jersey when Paola Delgado-Polanco, a 32-year-old woman originally from Mexico, was pronounced dead on Wednesday morning. Delgado-Polanco had been pregnant and was rushed to the hospital after experiencing complications with her pregnancy. Her baby, who was born three months premature, is in a critical but stable condition. According to authorities, Delgado-Polanco was brought to University Hospital on Tuesday evening. It was reported that she was struggling to breathe and doctors quickly discovered that her baby was in distress. Despite their best efforts, Delgado-Polanco passed away early the next morning. The family is understandably devastated by the loss of Delgado-Polanco. She was a beloved wife and mother-to-be, and her death has left a void in their lives. However, they are grateful that her baby is still fighting and receiving the care that they need at the hospital. Delgado-Polanco's story is a painful reminder of the dangers that women can face during pregnancy. In the United States, maternal mortality rates are rising, and women of color are disproportionately affected. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, black and American Indian/Alaska Native women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women. It is not clear at this time what caused Delgado-Polanco's death, and an autopsy will likely be performed to determine the cause. However, her family hopes that their loss can bring attention to the issue of maternal mortality and encourage efforts to improve maternal healthcare in the United States. The family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the medical expenses for Delgado-Polanco's baby. They are asking for donations to help support the baby's care and provide for their future. As of Thursday, the page has raised over $20,000. The community has rallied around the family in their time of need. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka expressed his condolences on Twitter, writing ""Our prayers are with the family of Paola Delgado-Polanco during this difficult time. We stand with them, work to support them, and will do all we can to ease their pain."" The Delgado-Polanco family has been touched by the outpouring of support from the community. They ask that people keep them in their thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. In conclusion, the loss of Paola Delgado-Polanco is a heartbreaking reminder of the dangers that women can face during pregnancy. Her family is mourning her loss while also praying for the recovery of her premature baby. The community is rallying around them and supporting their needs during this difficult time. We can only hope that this tragedy raises awareness about the need for improved maternal healthcare in the United States.","(497, 26)","Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball

Delgado-Polanco’s three-month-old baby, who was also present during the attack, is currently in critical but stable condition at a local hospital.
According to police reports, the suspect, identified as 22-year-old Juan Carlos Hernandez, has been arrested and charged with murder.
The motive behind the attack is still under investigation, but authorities believe it may have been triggered by an argument between the couple.
This tragic incident serves as a reminder of the dangers of domestic violence and the importance of seeking help if you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship.
Domestic violence is a serious issue that affects people from all walks of life, regardless of age, gender, or socioeconomic status.
It can take many forms, including physical, emotional, sexual, and financial abuse.
Victims of domestic violence often suffer in silence, fearing for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.
However, it is important to remember that help is available, and there are resources and organizations that can provide support and assistance to those in need.
If you suspect that someone you know is a victim of domestic violence, reach out to them and offer your support.
Encourage them to seek help from a trusted friend, family member, or professional.
Remember, you can make a difference by speaking up and standing up for those who cannot speak for themselves.","(299, 13)","Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball

Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and
","Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and a government official said Tuesday. There were conflicting reports about where Mehsud died. The government official told CNN Mehsud died as a result of the January 14 attack in North Waziristan. He was seriously injured, and was moved to the Orakzai region, where he died and was buried more than a week ago, the official said, citing information from local pro-government militias. Other sources said Mehsud died near the city of Multan in central Pakistan while on his way to a treatment center in Karachi. Authorities have been looking into reports that Mehsud died after being wounded last month in a drone attack. Word of his death contradicts a statement by a Taliban spokesman last week that Mehsud was alive and in hiding. Also last week, a Pakistani news outlet reported that Mehsud had been killed. State broadcaster PTV reported that Mehsud was wounded in a drone attack this month, died and was buried. The drone attack occurred at a madrassa, or religious school, said Pakistani intelligence and local officials in North Waziristan. The school had been converted into a training camp for militants, the officials said. That attack came a few days after Mehsud appeared in a video released by the Pakistani Taliban. In it, he sits next to Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, the man thought to be the suicide bomber who killed seven CIA officers and consultants and a Jordanian army captain at a base in eastern Afghanistan on December 30. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. It was carried out to avenge the death of Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year, according to al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid. Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe, not the same family. The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones, or unmanned aircraft. But the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. Journalist Nasir Dawar contributed to this report .","(402, 19)","Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, has reportedly been killed, according to three Taliban sources. A government source has also confirmed that Mehsud died after an attack that took place on January 14th in North Waziristan. Authorities have been investigating several reports claiming that Mehsud was killed in a drone attack that occurred last month. However, Taliban spokesman Shahidullah Shahid last week said that Mehsud was alive and well. Mehsud has been the leader of the Pakistani Taliban since 2009 and is believed to have been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in the country. He was also involved in the failed Times Square bombing in New York City in 2010. His death marks a significant blow to the Pakistani Taliban, which has been responsible for numerous attacks in the country over the past several years. The group has been fighting for the implementation of strict Islamic law and the overthrow of the Pakistani government. The news of Mehsud's death has been met with mixed reactions in Pakistan. Some have welcomed the news, seeing it as a victory in the fight against terrorism. Others, however, have expressed concern that the death of the Pakistani Taliban leader could lead to further violence and instability in the country. The Pakistani government has not yet issued an official statement on Mehsud's death. Meanwhile, the US government has not yet confirmed or denied its involvement in the attack that killed Mehsud. The US has been carrying out drone strikes in Pakistan for several years, targeting members of the Taliban and other militant groups. The Pakistani government has publicly criticized the US drone program, calling it a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. However, the US maintains that drone strikes are necessary in the fight against terrorism. It remains to be seen what impact Mehsud's death will have on the Pakistani Taliban and the broader fight against terrorism in Pakistan. The country has been dealing with a wave of violence in recent years, and the death of a high-profile militant leader could either exacerbate the situation or lead to a turning point in the fight against terrorism.","(386, 18)","Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and

Mehsud's death would be a major blow to the Pakistani Taliban, which has been waging a bloody insurgency against the Pakistani government since 2007.
The group has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the 2012 attack on a school in Peshawar that killed more than 140 people, most of them children.
If confirmed, Mehsud's death would also be a major victory for the United States, which has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture or death.
The United States has accused Mehsud of being behind a number of attacks on U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, including a 2009 suicide bombing that killed seven CIA employees in Khost, Afghanistan.
U.S. officials have said they believe Mehsud was responsible for the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt, although he has not been charged in connection with that attack.
The Pakistani Taliban is a separate group from the Afghan Taliban, but the two groups have close ties and often coordinate their activities.
The death of Mehsud would likely lead to a power struggle within the Pakistani Taliban, as different factions vie for control of the group.
The Pakistani Taliban has been weakened in recent years by a series of U.S. drone strikes and Pakistani military operations, but it still poses a significant threat to the Pakistani government and to U.S. interests in the region.","(337, 12)","Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and
a government source told CNN.
A government source said Mehsud died after a January 14 attack on his convoy in North
Waziristan, a tribal region on the Afghan border.
Authorities have been looking for Mehsud since a drone attack on January 13 killed
another Pakistani Taliban leader, Wali-ur-Rehman, in the same area.
A spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) last week denied reports that
Mehsud was dead, saying he was alive and in good health.
A Taliban spokesman on Saturday said Mehsul was alive and well.
""We have no information about the death of Mehsud,"" Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan
told CNN. ""He is alive and well.""
The government source said the drone attack on Mehsud's convoy was carried out by the
United States.
The United States has been carrying out drone strikes in Pakistan since 2004, targeting
militants in the country's tribal regions.
The drone strike on January 14 killed Mehsud and three other militants, the government
source said.
The attack took place in the Shawal Valley, a mountainous area near the border with
Afghanistan, the source said.
It was not immediately clear whether Mehsud had been killed in the drone strike or
whether he had died of natural causes.
The Pakistani government has been trying to negotiate a peace deal with the TTP,
which has been waging a bloody insurgency in the country since 2007.
The TTP has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile attacks in Pakistan,
including the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007
and the attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in December 2014, which killed
more than 150 people.
The group also claimed responsibility for the attack on a military-run school in
December 2014 that killed more than 140 people, including 132 children.
The government has accused the TTP of carrying out a number of attacks in the country,
including a suicide attack on a police station in the city of Quetta in October 2014
that killed at least 60 people.
In January 2015, the TTP claimed responsibility for an attack on a Shiite mosque in
Karachi that killed 45 people.
A month later, the group claimed responsibility for another attack on a mosque in
Lahore that killed 14 people.
Mehsul's death would be a major blow to the TTP's efforts to negotiate peace with the
government.
It would also be a major setback for the United States, which has been using drone
strikes to target militants in Pakistan's tribal areas.
The U.S. has carried out more than 400 drone strikes in the tribal regions since
2004, killing more than 2,000 people, according to the Bureau of Investigative
Journalism.
The strikes have been criticized by human rights groups, who say they have killed
innocent civilians, including women and children.","(533, 22)"

","By . Andy Sims, Press Association . England shotgun ace Charlotte Kerwood blasted her way to Commonwealth Games glory in the double trap. The 27-year-old from Sussex was in devastating form at the Barry Buddon Centre in Dundee, nailing 94 of her 120 clays to claim her third individual Commonwealth gold medal. Kerwood won her first gold at Manchester 2002 aged just 15, and would probably have more in her collection had the event not been excluded in Delhi last time out. Shooting for gold: Charlotte Kerwood was in brilliant form in the double trap event . Easy peasy: Kerwood won her third Commonwealth Games gold medal in the double trap on Sunday . She finished two shots clear of India's Shreyasi Singh, who claimed silver. Rachel Parish, with whom Kerwood also won pairs gold at Melbourne 2006, made it a medal double for England by taking bronze. The 33-year-old from Nottingham finished level with Canada's Cynthia Meyer on 91 and triumphed in a sudden-death shoot-off. Kerwood led by five shots at the start of the final round and appeared relaxed, smiling and laughing, as the competitors lined up. But with Singh and Meyer closing in, she missed a pair halfway through the round and gave herself a dressing down before holding her nerve over the final few shots. 'It feels pretty good, I can't quite believe it,' Kerwood told Press Association Sport. 'The Commonwealth Games obviously like me, it's a good event to come to. 'I was laughing because I didn't realise I was five targets ahead at the start, so I thought 'no pressure!' Then I felt it was slipping away from me a little bit, which wasn't good. But now it feels amazing.' Congratulations: Kerwood gets a hug after easing to victory in the shooting double trap event . Kerwood will have little opportunity to celebrate, though, as she lines up in her favoured event, the Olympic trap, on Monday morning. 'That will be good experience for tomorrow because now I know what to expect with the crowd and everything. 'There's no time to celebrate yet. Tomorrow is what I have been training for. My coach thinks I was crazy going for this one as well but I'm going to be more confident now.' For Parish, who claimed silver behind Kerwood in the individual event eight years ago, it was also a test of nerve in the shoot-off. 'I've practised doing that before with the other England guys, I knew what was coming and I knew I'd done it before and I could do it again - and I did,' she said. 'I'm disappointed with the way I shot today, I know I can shoot a lot better than that, so I'm really pleased to have come away with a medal. 'I think there will be some champagne now. Possibly a lot!'","(547, 28)","British shooter Charlotte Kerwood added another gold medal to her impressive portfolio on Saturday at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. The 27-year-old nailed 94 of 120 clays to win her third Commonwealth gold, finishing two shots clear of India's Shreyasi Singh. Kerwood first tasted success in Manchester back in 2002, at the young age of just 15, when she won her first Commonwealth gold medal. Since then, she has become a familiar face in international shooting competitions and has continued to impress. ""I'm absolutely delighted,"" exclaimed Kerwood. ""It's always special to win a gold medal, but to do it at a major event like the Commonwealth Games is even sweeter. The competition was tough, but I managed to keep my focus and put in a solid performance."" Kerwood's focus will now turn to her favored event, the Olympic trap, which takes place on Monday. She will be hoping to add to her impressive collection of medals, which includes a silver at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and a bronze at the 2010 Delhi games. Despite her success on the international stage, Kerwood remains humble and dedicated to her craft. ""Shooting is a sport that requires a lot of hard work and training,"" she said. ""I'm constantly striving to improve my technique and consistency. It's a tough sport, but one that I love and am passionate about."" Kerwood's success is a testament to her determination and dedication, and she serves as an inspiration to aspiring shooters around the world. Her impressive collection of medals is a reminder that anything is possible with hard work and perseverance. The Commonwealth Games continue to provide a platform for young athletes to showcase their skills on an international stage. With competition stiffening every year, it is clear that this is where future Olympians are born. As the games draw to a close, it is clear that these athletes have left an indelible mark on the sporting world. They have demonstrated that with hard work, determination, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, anything is possible. We look forward to seeing what these athletes will achieve in the future.","(407, 20)","By. Andy Sims, Press Association. England shotgun ace Charlotte Kerwood blasted her way

(CNN) -- A man was shot and killed Saturday in Oakland, California, during a confrontation
","(CNN) -- A man was shot and killed Saturday in Oakland, California, during a confrontation with Bay Area Rapid Transit officers and Oakland police, police spokesman Jeff Thomason said. The incident occurred after Oakland police received a call about 8:15 a.m. (11:15 a.m. ET) of an armed man walking toward the Fruitvale BART station, according to Thomason. Police notified BART officers, who also responded. BART officers were the first to reach the suspect, described as a Hispanic male between 30 and 40 years old, Thomason said. The BART officers chased the man from the station to the street, where Oakland police joined in the pursuit over four blocks in the Fruitvale area. Thomason said Oakland police tried to Taser the man twice, but to no effect. The man, armed with two knives, then attempted to charge at one of the officers, a police statement said. Multiple officers opened fire, killing him, the statement said. The man has not yet been identified, Thomason said. The shooting is under investigation by the Oakland police homicide unit, internal affairs and the Alameda County district attorney. ""Anytime there is a loss of life, it is a matter of great concern and sadness for us all,"" Oakland Mayor Ronald Dellums said in a statement. ""It is extremely important that we as a community continue to work together in order to provide a safe and secure environment. Therefore, a thorough investigation of the circumstances surrounding this death has begun."" BART police have also opened a separate, parallel investigation. The incident comes more than a week after a former BART police officer was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2009 shooting death of an unarmed black man on a train platform at the Fruitvale station. The January 1, 2009, shooting of 22-year-old Oscar Grant was captured on a bystander's cell-phone video camera. The video was widely circulated on the Internet and on news broadcasts, and it spurred several protests in and around Oakland. The video showed former officer Johannes Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Grant in the back as another officer knelt on the unarmed man. Mehserle and other Bay Area Rapid Transit police had been called to the Fruitvale station after passengers complained about fights on a train. Officers pulled several men, including Grant, off the train when it arrived at Fruitvale.","(444, 21)","In a shocking turn of events, police officers responding to a report of an armed man near the Fruitvale BART station were forced to shoot the suspect after their attempts at subduing him failed. The man, who remains unidentified at this time, brandished a knife and refused to comply with police orders, leading to a deadly confrontation. According to eyewitnesses, the man appeared agitated and erratic when police arrived on the scene. Despite their efforts to deescalate the situation, the man continued to resist, leading to a tense standoff between police and the suspect. In an effort to subdue the man, police officers attempted to use Tasers on him twice, but to no avail. This only seemed to agitate the suspect further, as he turned on the officers with the knife in his hand. At this point, police officers were left with no choice but to use lethal force. They opened fire on the suspect, who was subsequently transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. As is the standard procedure in cases of police-involved shootings, an investigation has been launched to determine whether the officers' use of force was justified. The officers involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave pending the conclusion of the investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage and raised questions about police use of force, especially in cases involving people suffering from mental health issues. Critics argue that the officers in this incident could have done more to deescalate the situation before resorting to lethal force. In response to the shooting, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf released a statement expressing her condolences to the family of the deceased and promising a full investigation into the incident. ""The use of lethal force is always a last resort, and we owe it to the family and the community to understand what led to this tragic outcome,"" Schaaf said in the statement. The incident near the Fruitvale BART station serves as a stark reminder of the dangers that police officers face every day in their efforts to protect our communities. As the investigation into this incident continues, it is clear that there are no simple answers when it comes to issues of police use of force, mental health, and public safety.","(416, 16)","(CNN) -- A man was shot and killed Saturday in Oakland, California, during a confrontation

(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant
","(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant owners A.M.S.P Suppiah and his wife Kanageswary Suppiah. In a David-and-Goliath match-up in the world of fast food, McCurry -- a small Indian curry shop in Malaysia -- has won an eight-year legal battle against the hamburger giant. McDonald's claimed that the prefix ""Mc"" in McCurry trampled on its trademark. The country's Federal Court on Tuesday ruled that it didn't. ""We're very relieved -- much, much relieved -- that this eight-year-old saga is finally over,"" said McCurry owner P. Suppiah. ""We're a typical South Asian-Malay cuisine. No way people walking into McCurry can confuse us with McDonald's."" The sparse 24/7 self-service restaurant in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is popular with blue-collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare, such as biryani rice and fishhead curry. Its logo: a chicken flashing a thumbs-up. The eatery opened in 1999. McDonald's filed suit two years later. ""We were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court,"" Suppiah said. ""We felt that we had nothing in common, because we were not selling any Western fast food."" The hamburger chain, which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia, said McCurry was violating the prefix ""Mc"" and that McDonald's had the right to protect it. McCurry, in turn, said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across Europe. Furthermore, it said, the ""Mc"" in McCurry stands for ""Malaysian Chicken Curry."" A lower court ruled in favor of McDonald's, and Suppiah appealed. An appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling, prompting McDonald's to appeal this time. On Tuesday, the Federal Court -- the highest in the land -- held up the appeals court ruling. McDonald's said it accepts the judgment. ""We respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment,"" said Liam Jeory of McDonald's Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Suppiah said the ruling means he can now add other McCurry locations, with its slogan: ""Tasty and so Gooood.""","(425, 23)","In a surprise victory, the Indian restaurant chain McCurry has come out on top in a legal battle with fast food giant McDonald’s. In a case that has been dubbed a David-and-Goliath match-up, McDonald’s had claimed that the use of “Mc” in the McCurry name infringed on its trademark. However, the judge presiding over the case ultimately ruled in favor of McCurry, stating that there was no evidence of confusion between the two brands. McCurry owner P. Suppiah expressed relief at the decision, stating, “We’re very relieved -- much, much relieved.” The case was brought to court after McDonald’s filed a trademark infringement suit against McCurry. In the suit, McDonald’s argued that the use of “Mc” in the McCurry name and branding could cause confusion and dilute the McDonald’s trademark. The case was closely watched by many in the fast food industry, as it was seen as a test of whether the McDonald’s trademark was strong enough to prevent other companies from using similar names or branding. In his ruling, the judge noted that the two brands were quite distinct from one another, with McDonald’s primarily offering burgers and fries and McCurry specializing in Indian cuisine. The judge also pointed out that the use of “Mc” was not unique to McDonald’s and had been used by other companies in the past. Despite this ruling, McDonald’s has vowed to continue protecting its trademark and has said that it is considering an appeal. In a statement, the company said, “We are disappointed with the court’s decision and are currently considering our options. We remain committed to protecting our brand and trademarks.” McCurry, on the other hand, is celebrating its legal victory and has said that it will continue to operate under its current name and branding. The company’s success in this case could also potentially pave the way for other small businesses to use the “Mc” prefix in their names without fear of legal action from McDonald’s. Overall, the case highlights the challenges faced by smaller companies when taking on large corporations in legal battles, as well as the importance of protecting intellectual property and trademarks in the fast-paced and competitive world of fast food.","(432, 13)","(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant
defeated McDonald's in a legal battle over the use of the word ""Mc"" in its name, a Singapore court ruled Wednesday.
McDonald's had claimed that McCurry's use of the ""Mc"" infringed on its trademark, but the Singapore High Court rejected the fast food giant's argument.
""We're very relieved,"" McCurry owner P.Suppiah told CNN after the ruling. ""Much, much relieved.""
McDonald's said it was disappointed with the ruling and was considering an appeal.
McCurry, which serves Indian food, opened in 1997 in Singapore, where McDonald's has been operating since 1979. The two restaurants are located just a few blocks from each other in the city-state's Orchard Road shopping district.
McDonald's filed a lawsuit against McCurry in 2001, claiming that McCurry's name was too similar to McDonald's and would confuse customers into thinking the two restaurants were related.
McDonald's also argued that McCurry was trying to ride on the coattails of McDonald's success by using the ""Mc"" prefix in its name.
McCurry countered that it had been using the name for more than 10 years before McDonald's filed the lawsuit, and that there was no confusion between the two restaurants because they served different types of food.
The Singapore High Court agreed with McCurry, saying there was no evidence that customers were confused about the difference between the two restaurants.
The court also said that McDonald's had waited too long to file the lawsuit, as McCurry had been using its name for more than a decade before McDonald's took action.
McDonald's said in a statement that it was ""disappointed"" with the ruling, and that it was considering appealing the decision.
""We believe we have a strong case and will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights,"" the company said.
McCurry's Suppiah said he was happy with the ruling, but added that the legal battle had taken a toll on him and his family.
""It's been a very stressful time for us,"" he said. ""We're just glad that it's finally over.""
McCurry's victory is a rare win for a small business against a multinational corporation. In recent years, large companies have been increasingly aggressive in protecting their trademarks, often filing lawsuits against small businesses that they claim are infringing on their intellectual property.
The case is also significant because it could set a precedent for other small businesses in Singapore and around the world that are facing similar challenges from large corporations.
McCurry plans to continue operating under its current name, and Suppiah says he hopes the ruling will send a message to other small businesses that they can stand up to big corporations.
""I hope this will give other small businesses the courage to fight back when they're being bullied by big companies,"" he said.","(562, 23)","(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant

McCurry's owner, P.Suppiah, said he was ""very relieved"" by the court's decision.
""We are very relieved,"" Suppiah told CNN. ""Much, much relieved.""
Suppiah said he had no plans to change the name of his restaurant.
""I don't think I'll change the name,"" he said. ""I think it's a good name. It's a very good name.""
The court ruled that McDonald's had failed to prove that the use of the name would cause confusion among customers.
The court also said McDonald's did not have a monopoly on the use of ""Mc.""
""The use of 'Mc' is not exclusive to McDonald's,"" the court said in its ruling. ""It is also used by other fast food restaurants.""
The ruling is a victory for McCurry, which has been in business for more than 20 years.
Suppiah, who has been in the restaurant business for 30 years, said he had been using the name McCurry since he opened his first restaurant in 1990.
He said he had never received any complaints from McDonald's about the use of his name.
""They never said anything to me about it,"" Suppiah said.
He added that he had no intention of changing the name of the restaurant.
The McCurry restaurant is located in the city of Chennai, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
It is one of the most popular fast food restaurants in the city.
The restaurant serves a variety of fast food items, including burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, and salads.
It also offers a variety of beverages, including coffee, tea, and milkshakes.
The name McCurry is a combination of the words ""McDonald"" and ""Curry.""
The restaurant has been in operation since 1990, and it is one of Chennai's most popular restaurants.
It has a large number of customers, and it serves a wide variety of food items.
The owner of the restaurant, Suppiah, said that he had never had any problems with McDonald's, and that he had not received any complaints about the name.

ROME, Italy -- Captain Javier Zanetti saved Inter Milan's unbeaten Serie A record as he
","ROME, Italy -- Captain Javier Zanetti saved Inter Milan's unbeaten Serie A record as he rifled home a stunning late volley to earn a 1-1 draw against second-placed Roma at the San Siro on Wednesday. Zanetti celebrates his late strike as Inter retained their unbeaten Serie A record with a 1-1 draw against Roma. Roma captain Francesco Totti had given the visitors a deserved first-half leadbut Zanetti's strike two minutes from time maintained Inter's nine-point lead at the top. Roma needed to win to breathe new life into the title race but they were dealt a cruel blow as French defender Philippe Mexes was sent-off late on for two bookings in quick succession. Inter capitalised and they have now lost only once in their last 65 league matches. The home side had the first clear-cut chance of the match and were within centimeters of taking the lead when Hernan Crespo met a cross from Patrick Vieira with an acrobatic volley, but saw his effort cannon back off the post. The defending champions were made to pay for that miss on 38 minutes as the visitors orchestrated a sublime goal. Neat footwork from Macedonia international Mirko Vucinic released Max Tonetto down the left and his pin-point cross was flicked home at the near post by Totti from six meters out as he stole in front of defender Cristian Chivu. Inter center-back Nicolas Burdisso should have restored parity in first-half stoppage time but his header from Luis Figo's corner flew over the bar. Figo himself had a great chance on 54 minutes but after having time to set himself up for an attempted volley, he skewed his effort so badly that it did not even go out of play. After Mexes' dismissal 10 from time, Inter laid siege to Roma's goal. Goalkeeper Doni had to be alert to tip over Crespo's header three minutes from time but he could do nothing about Zanetti's volley a minute later. Meanwhile, AC Milan slipped to fifth place as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Catania. Brazilian teenager Pato gave them the lead early in the second half with a skimming long-range shot but substitute Gionathan Spinesi's header earnt the Sicilians a point. Fiorentina are up to fourth after they defeated Livorno 1-0 at home thanks to a goal from Senegal forward Ndiaye Papa Waigo.

Despite the draw, the result ensured that Inter Milan maintained their comfortable nine-point lead at the top of the Serie A table and remained unbeaten in the league. The match had started off in a high-octane fashion with both sides creating opportunities, but none were converted in the opening period. Roma took the lead in the 60th minute when Simone Perrotta fired home following a neat one-two with Francesco Totti. Roma held on to their lead for over thirty minutes as Inter Milan peppered the opposition goal with shots. Inter Milan finally found the equalizer in the 92nd minute when their beloved captain Javier Zanetti struck a stunning shot into the bottom corner of the Roma net, sending the Inter faithful into absolute delirium. Zanetti's late contribution was a fitting tribute to the legend on his 600th appearance for the club. The draw was a valuable point for Roma who had been on a poor run of form recently, while Inter Milan maintained their cushion at the top of the table. The result also meant that enemy city rivals AC Milan slipped down to fifth place after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Catania. Milan had taken the lead in the 17th minute through Robinho's header, but Catania equalized just before half-time through a goal from Gonzalo Bergessio. Despite intense pressure from Milan during the second half, they were unable to find a winner, as Catania defended resolutely. The draw left Milan five points behind Inter Milan, who continued to set the pace in the Serie A race. The result also marked Milan's second consecutive draw, following their stalemate against Udinese in the previous game week. With just a handful of games remaining in the season, Inter Milan will look to maintain their lead and remain unbeaten, while AC Milan will need to win their remaining games if they are to bridge the gap to their rivals. One thing is for certain, the Serie A title race is far from over, and there promises to be plenty of twists and turns in the coming weeks.","(407, 15)","ROME, Italy -- Captain Javier Zanetti saved Inter Milan's unbeaten Serie A record as he

(CNN) -- Authorities in Tehran, Iran, have given the go-ahead to execute a woman who
","(CNN) -- Authorities in Tehran, Iran, have given the go-ahead to execute a woman who initially was sentenced to death by stoning, according to an activist working on her behalf. However, what method will be used to execute Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani is unclear, said Mina Ahadi, spokeswoman for the International Committee Against Stoning. The execution could happen as soon as Wednesday, she said, citing information received from a source in Tabriz, Iran, who is close to Ashtiani's family. Ashtiani initially was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. The Iranian government later said she was also convicted of murdering her husband, but her lawyer and family dispute that. A letter from Tehran was delivered to the prison in Tabriz where Ashtiani is being held three days ago, Ahadi said, giving the go-ahead for Ashtiani's execution. Ashtiani, 43 and a mother of two, drew international attention when she was sentenced to death by stoning. She concedes that she was convicted of adultery, as initially reported, but says she was acquitted of murder. ""The man who actually killed my husband was identified and imprisoned, but he is not sentenced to death,"" she said in August. The Iranian government's claims that she was convicted of murder are a lie, she told the Guardian newspaper through an intermediary. ""They are embarrassed by the international attention on my case, and they are desperately trying to distract attention and confuse the media so that they can kill me in secret."" Ashtiani's son and her attorney are still in jail after being arrested last month, Ahadi said. Also still detained are two German journalists. ""The International Committees against Stoning and Execution call on international bodies and the people of the world to come out in full force against the state-sponsored murder of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani,"" as well as the release of the others, Ahadi said in a statement. Before his arrest, Ashtiani's son, Sajjad Ghaderzadeh, said court officials stole documents and files pertaining to the murder of his father in order to ""promote his mother as a murderer."" And Ahadi's committee said the murder charges are ""fabricated"" by the Iranian regime. In August, Ashtiani appeared on state TV confessing that she knew about a plot to kill her husband but felt she had been misled. Amnesty International condemned the interview. Ghaderzadeh and attorney Hootan Kian will not be issued an attorney, because the government claims they do not need one, according to Ahadi. Ashtiani's other former lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, is being protected by European diplomats after he fled to Turkey from Iran. Mostafaei claims that Iranian authorities tried to arrest him without cause.","(508, 21)","Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, a woman who was initially sentenced to death by stoning in Iran, could be executed as soon as Wednesday. The case of Ashtiani has attracted international attention due to the controversy surrounding her sentencing, which has been condemned by human rights organizations around the world. Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006, according to her lawyer, and was sentenced to death by stoning. The sentence was later reduced to a 10-year prison term after international outrage. However, the Iranian government has alleged that she was also convicted of murder, a charge that her family denies. Ashtiani's fate has been the subject of much debate and outcry from various groups, including the Vatican, which has called for her release. In 2010, the Italian government offered to take her in as a refugee, but Iranian authorities declined the offer. Human rights organizations have also called on the Iranian government to release Ashtiani. Amnesty International has stated that the charges against her were ""unfair"" and that she has been subjected to torture and other forms of mistreatment while in detention. Ashtiani's case has drawn international attention to the issue of stoning, which is still a legal form of punishment in Iran. In recent years, the use of stoning as a form of punishment has been increasingly criticized by the international community, with many human rights organizations arguing that it is a cruel and inhumane practice. Despite these criticisms, the Iranian government has defended the use of stoning, arguing that it is an appropriate punishment for crimes such as adultery and murder. However, Ashtiani's case has highlighted the arbitrary nature of the Iranian justice system, which has been accused of using stoning as a means of political repression. Ashtiani's family has consistently denied the government's claim that she was convicted of murder, and has called for her release. The family has also accused Iranian authorities of intimidating them and preventing them from speaking out about Ashtiani's case. Ashtiani's case is just one example of the many human rights abuses that occur in Iran on a regular basis. Human rights organizations have criticized the Iranian government for its treatment of political dissidents, journalists, and women's rights activists, among other groups. Ashtiani's potential execution has sparked outrage around the world, with many calling for the Iranian government to intervene and save her life. It remains to be seen whether the Iranian authorities will heed these calls, or whether they will continue to enforce their harsh and unjust legal system.","(470, 19)","(CNN) -- Authorities in Tehran, Iran, have given the go-ahead to execute a woman who
was convicted of adultery, according to Iranian state media.
Sakineh Mohammdi Ashtiani, 43, could be put to death as soon as Wednesday, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported.
Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006 after her husband accused her of having an affair with two men. She was sentenced to 99 lashes for having an extramarital affair and 10 years in prison for playing a role in the death of her husband, who was killed in a fight with one of the men with whom she was alleged to have had an affair, according to Amnesty International.
Her sentence was later changed to execution by stoning, a punishment that has been condemned by human rights groups around the world.
Ashtiani's son, Sajad Qaderzadeh, told CNN that his mother was convicted of murdering her husband, not of adultery.
""She was convicted of killing her husband,"" he said. ""She didn't kill her husband. Her husband was killed by someone else.""
Qaderzadeh said his mother was lashed 99 times in 2006, but he did not know if she received the 10-year prison sentence.
""I don't know if she went to jail or not,"" he said.
Iranian authorities have denied that Ashtiani was sentenced to death for adultery, saying she was convicted of being an accomplice in her husband's murder, according to the semiofficial ISNA news agency.
""Ms. Ashtiani has been sentenced to death for her role in the murder of her husband,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said, according to ISNA. ""She was not sentenced to death for committing adultery.""
Mehmanparast said Ashtiani's case would be reviewed by Iran's Supreme Court.
Amnesty International called on Iranian authorities to halt Ashtiani's execution.
""The Iranian authorities must immediately halt any plans to execute Sakineh Mohammedi Ashtiani,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa.
""Sakineh Ashtiani has already been subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,"" Sahraoui said in a statement. ""If she is executed, it will be yet another example of the Iranian authorities' callous disregard for human life.""","(431, 19)",,

The defeat will undoubtedly go down as one of the most humiliating in World Cup history, and one that will be etched in the memory of Brazilian fans for years to come. The match started poorly for Brazil as Germany took the lead after just 11 minutes through Thomas Muller. However, it was the second-half that proved to be catastrophic for the host nation, as Germany scored four goals within just six minutes. Brazil was left shell-shocked and unable to mount any sort of comeback, despite pulling one back through Oscar. The defeat sparked a flood of reactions on social media, as players from around the world took to Twitter to express their shock and disbelief. England's Daniel Sturridge tweeted ""Wow, what did I just witness? That was unbelievable,"" while Arsenal's Theo Walcott simply said ""7-1.. ouch!""

It was a triumph for Germany's coach, Joachim Low, who had been criticized in the run-up to the tournament for his team selection and tactics. For Brazil, the result will lead to a period of soul-searching and introspection. Just four years after winning the Copa America and Confederations Cup, the team has now suffered two humiliating defeats in major international tournaments, following their 3-0 loss to the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup third-place playoff.

","By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:49 EST, 26 November 2011 . It is one of the defining images of Christmas, as children cosy up to Santa on his knee to tell him exactly what presents they want. But in an age of 'government guidance' and overcautious school bosses, it was only a matter of time before it became a tradition of the past. A rising number of schools are now forbidding children from sitting on Santa's knee, with increasing numbers of teachers banning any physically contact with Santa at all. Thing of the past: The scene of children sitting on Santa's knee could be over after government guidance suggested there should be no physical contact between Father Christmas and children. With those playing 'Santa' no longer required to pass a CRB check, more and more schools are opting to 'err' on the side of caution and impose strict rules on children visiting Father Christmas. Parents who volunteer for the role of Santa don't have to undergo CRB checks as they do not come into regular contact with children. But those who want to don the red suit and big festive white beard can now only do in many schools as long as they are not left alone with the children and don't let them sit on their laps. Government guidance now states: 'Under no circumstances must a volunteer who has not obtained a CRB disclosure... be left unsupervised with children.' Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told the Daily Telegraph this ruling meant many members had decided it is better if Santa avoided all physical contact with children. He said: 'The climate we work in, and the risk of getting it wrong, mean many school leaders err on the side of cuation. 'And if you are going to 'err' on the side of caution, that's the side most parents would prefer.' A spokesman for the Department for Education said children could still sit on Father Christmas’s knee as long as parents were consulted and were 'completely comfortable' with the situation. Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, told the Telegraph: 'It would be a great shame if misinterpretation of regulations deterred schools from traditional festive celebrations.'","(422, 17)","Parents are being warned not to leave their children alone with Santa Claus this Christmas season, according to updated government guidance issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. The guidance highlights the importance of safeguarding children and states that it is not safe to assume that Santa can be trusted to be alone with children. Although Santa is a beloved figure around the world, there have been instances in the past where individuals dressed as Santa have abused children. The updated guidance serves as a reminder that even during joyful festivities, parents must remain vigilant. “While it is important for children to experience the magic of Christmas, parents must ensure that their children remain safe at all times,” the guidance warns. “It is crucial to remember that Santa cannot be left with children unsupervised.” The guidance goes on to state that in situations where Santa is visiting a school or community event, there should always be at least one other adult present. The guidance also advises that all adults working with children should have a valid DBS check. The updated guidance has been welcomed by child protection groups, who have long called for greater safeguards around interactions between children and adults dressed as Santa. A spokesperson for the NSPCC said, “It is vital that parents remain alert to the potential risks associated with leaving their children alone with someone dressed as Santa. While the overwhelming majority of Santa actors are trustworthy, there are some individuals who use the guise of Santa as a means to gain access to children.” The Department of Health and Social Care has stressed that the guidance is intended to provide practical advice to parents and schools during the festive season. The government has also announced plans to roll out a nationwide campaign to raise awareness of the importance of safeguarding children during the Christmas period. As the festive season approaches, it is important that all of us remain vigilant and safeguard children from potential risks. Parents are reminded that Santa is not immune to the need for supervision and caution, even while spreading Christmas cheer.","(383, 13)","By. Daily Mail Reporter. UPDATED:. 16:49 EST, 26 November 2011. It
may be the season of goodwill, but parents have been warned not to leave
Santa with their children unsupervised.
Government guidance stresses that the jolly old elf cannot be left with
children unsupervised, even for a short period of time.
The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) has issued the
advice as part of its 'Keeping Children Safe in Education' document.
It states: 'Children should never be left unsupervised. This includes
leaving children at home alone for brief periods of time, for example, if
a parent or carer goes out briefly to post a letter.
'This also includes leaving a child unattended while you do an errand,
such as going to the corner shop, or leaving them alone in a parked car
while you run another errand. Children should never be left in a closed
vehicle, for example, a caravan or a car, even if it is in the back garden
or on a driveway.
'Leaving a child unattended in a car is dangerous, since in hot weather
the temperature can quickly become too high for the child, and in cold
weather the child could suffer from hypothermia.'
The guidance adds: 'Children should not be left in charge of younger
children as they are unlikely to be able to respond appropriately in an
emergency and may put themselves and the younger child at risk.
'For example, a child might let a younger child play on the road, open
cupboards when they have been told not to, or let the dog out when it
should be kept indoors.
'Parents and carers should not rely on other people, such as friends or
neighbours, to keep an eye on their children. Parents and carers should
not assume that older children will automatically know what to do to keep
themselves safe.'","(352, 16)",,

Wealthy parents pass on three quarters of their fortunes to their children meaning it will
","Wealthy parents pass on three quarters of their fortunes to their children meaning it will take 300 years for the offspring of today's super-rich to have average incomes, a survey has revealed. The sons and daughters of prestigious families are also likely to live longer than average, more likely to attend Oxbridge, live in expensive houses, and go on to become doctors or lawyers. There is also little difference in wealth or social standing when the richest families of the Victoria era are compared to their descendants today, according to the study. Scroll down for video . The study of 19,000 people, including 600 with rare surnames such as Pepys (after the noted diarist, pictured), found their modern-day descendants are just as wealthy as their Victorian counterparts . Publishing their findings in the Economic Journal, Professor Gregory Clark and Dr Neil Cummins said: 'What your great-great-grandfather was doing is still predictive of what you are doing now.' The pair examined the records of 19,000 people, including more than 600 rare family names such as Bazalgette, the Pepys, and Bigge. Joseph Bazalgette was responsible for building the world's first sewer system in London in the 19th century, the Pepys family tree contains noted diarist Samuel Pepys, and John Bigge was a judge and royal commissioner. They found that, compared to their relatives in 1850, those living with that surname today are almost certain to have amassed fortunes well beyond the reach of the average Briton. For example Sir Peter Bazalgette, the great-great-grandson of Sir Joseph, is the founder of Endemol television production company which created Big Brother and Deal or No Deal. The company was floated on the Dutch stock exchange in 2005. It trebled in value and was sold for £2.5billion in 2007. Survey estimates three quarters of any fortune is passed from parents to their children, meaning it will take 300 years for the offspring of today's super-rich to be as wealthy as the average Briton . The findings of Dr Clark and Dr Cummins, reported by The Guardian, suggest that the passing down of wealth has a far bigger impact on society than previously thought. The data showed a 'significant correlation between the wealth of families' even up to five generations apart. They estimate that three quarters of any estate is passed down to the offspring of wealthy families, despite inheritance taxes introduced in recent years. At that rate, it means that children of today's super-wealthy would take, on average, nearly three centuries to become as wealthy as the average Briton. Dr Clark and Dr Cummins said: 'Wilson, Thatcher, or Blair – the noisy cacophony of Westminster politics – makes no difference to the iron law of inheritance. 'Measures to promote social mobility have little prospect of succeeding. It’s always going to be the case that families with the greatest abilities will just pass them on to their children.'","(538, 20)","According to a recent study, modern-day descendants of wealthy Victorian families are just as financially well-off as their ancestors. Researchers surveyed 19,000 individuals, including 600 individuals with rare last names such as Pepys, and found that the offspring of today's elite will take 300 years to reach average wealth. The study, which was conducted across the United Kingdom, is one of the largest of its kind. The research team analyzed public records on wealth and documented the financial status of families over multiple generations. They also took into consideration the impact of inflation, taxes, and other economic factors. The results of the study showed that individuals with rare surnames such as Pepys were significantly wealthier than those with more common names. The researchers concluded that this is likely due to the fact that these families were able to pass down their wealth through multiple generations. Furthermore, the study found that it will take the offspring of today's wealthy families several centuries to reach the average level of wealth. This suggests that social mobility in the United Kingdom is limited, and that there is a persistent wealth gap between the elite and the rest of society. The researchers were quick to note that inherited wealth does not guarantee personal success or happiness. However, they did acknowledge that the financial stability and opportunities that come with wealth can provide a significant advantage. The findings of this study have important implications for policymakers and advocates for social justice. If social mobility in the United Kingdom is limited, it may be necessary to implement policies that address this issue. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of providing equal opportunities for all individuals regardless of their family background. Overall, this study sheds light on the persistence of wealth inequality in the United Kingdom. While modern-day descendants of wealthy Victorian families may continue to enjoy financial success, it is clear that social mobility remains a significant challenge for those outside the elite.","(358, 16)","Wealthy parents pass on three quarters of their fortunes to their children meaning it will
take 300 years for the offspring of today’s rich to reach the average wealth of the population,
according to a new study.
Researchers from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) looked at the
inheritances of 19,000 British people who died between 1891 and 2011. They found that the
offspring of those who died in 1891 had an average wealth of £2,500, while the offspring of
those who died in 2011 had an average of £200,000.
The study, published in the Journal of Economic History, also found that modern-day
descendants of wealthy Victorians are just as rich as their ancestors. This is despite the fact
that the value of the pound has increased by more than 1,000% since 1891.
The findings suggest that wealth is passed down through the generations, rather than being
diluted over time. The researchers say this is because wealthy families tend to have more
children, and those children are more likely to inherit their parents’ wealth.
However, the study also found that there is a limit to how much wealth can be passed down
from one generation to the next. Once a family’s wealth reaches a certain level, it becomes
more difficult to pass it on to the next generation. This is because the children of wealthy
families are more likely to spend their inheritance on luxury goods and services, rather than
investing it in assets that can be passed down to future generations.
The researchers say their findings have important implications for public policy. They argue
that governments should do more to encourage wealthy families to pass on their wealth to
future generations, rather than spending it on themselves. This could be done through tax
incentives or other measures that make it easier for wealthy families to leave their wealth to
their children.
Overall, the study provides new insights into the ways in which wealth is passed down
through the generations. It suggests that wealth is not evenly distributed across society, but
rather tends to concentrate in the hands of a small number of families. This has important
implications for social mobility and inequality, and highlights the need for policies that
promote greater equality of opportunity.","(415, 16)",,

The Berwyn police had to intervene and went to the house in question to investigate the issue. According to a neighbor, a family of three, including a woman who volunteers at animal shelters, lived in the house targeted. The neighbor spoke to reporters, stating that they had heard loud noises and disruptions for a few weeks, leading them to suspect an animal infestation in the property. The police and animal control personnel initially planned to use a variety of techniques to catch the animals, including live traps and baited cages. They set up traps on the property and waited patiently for results. The neighbor who reported the incident spoke to reporters and said, “I called the police because I’ve been hearing this constant scratching noise coming from the crawl space under my house. It’s been keeping me up at night, and I’m concerned about what kind of animals might be down there.” The police and animal control workers were able to place the traps and patiently waited to observe the movement of the animals. After several hours of waiting, two raccoons were successfully caught in the traps. Animal control workers were able to transport the captured raccoons to a safe location without causing harm to either the animals or any humans involved. The neighbors were relieved that the issue had been resolved without any injuries or property damage. Berwyn police reminded residents to be aware of the wildlife in their neighborhoods and to contact animal control or the police department in any case of disturbance. This case shows how important it is to have effective communication between residents, the police department, and animal control in maintaining public safety. It also highlights the importance of taking appropriate measures to resolve matters related to animal welfare, including setting up traps, catching animals and relocating them in a safe, humane manner.","(365, 14)","By.

The results of Warner's project are stunning, with each piece carefully crafted to evoke a sense of wonder and amazement. The desert scenes, in particular, are breathtaking, with sand dunes and rock formations made entirely out of human flesh. ""I wanted to create something that was both beautiful and strange,"" said Warner. ""The human body is such a fascinating subject, and I knew that I could create something truly unique by using it in a different way."" To achieve the desired effect, Warner used a combination of unusual lighting techniques and Photoshop to create the illusion of depth and texture.

Ed Miliband last night faced an angry backlash from Labour MPs after it emerged he held a secret meeting with George Galloway, who was thrown out of the party ten years ago. The Labour leader invited Respect MP Mr Galloway to his Commons office, where they had a ‘cordial and friendly conversation’ for nearly an hour. It has sparked rumours that Mr Miliband is considering allowing Mr Galloway to rejoin the party. But Labour MPs warned their leader . against taking such action. ‘Galloway is a traitor,’ said one. ‘It’s . naive lunacy for the leader to have anything to do with him. I thought . he wanted to get rid of the Red Ed tag. He will rejoin Labour over my . dead body.’ Mr Galloway was expelled from Labour . after he was accused of inciting foreign forces to rise up against . British troops invading Iraq – military action he strongly opposed. Last year, Mr Galloway humiliated Mr . Miliband by triumphing over Labour in the Bradford West by- election by a . thumping 10,000 votes. If he returned to his former party, it could give Mr Miliband an extra seat at the next General Election in 2015. Mr Miliband believes that winning seats in Labour’s northern stronghold is key to him ousting David Cameron from No  10. Controversial character: George Galloway MP, formerly of the Labour Party . Senior Labour sources denied there were plans to let Mr Galloway rejoin the party, saying it was ‘merely a get to know you’ meeting. But friends of Mr Galloway said he was ‘taken aback’ to receive the invitation. ‘Obviously it was an olive branch,’ said one. ‘It is hard to imagine why Ed would want to see him unless he is thinking of letting George back in. They had a very friendly chat and agreed to stay in touch. At one point in the meeting, Mr Miliband asked Mr Galloway why he had left the party. He replied, ‘I didn’t leave, I was thrown out.’ Both men laughed. News of the meeting, said to have taken place a few weeks ago, was leaked days after Mr Galloway greeted Margaret Thatcher’s death by saying: ‘May she burn in the hellfires.’ In 2006, he was ridiculed after taking time off from his MP’s duties to appear on Celebrity Big Brother. During one episode he pretended to be a cat. Labour last night confirmed the meeting took place but insisted there had been no attempt to bring Mr Galloway back into the party as many of his views were ‘unacceptable’.","(536, 38)","In an effort to distance himself from the ""Red Ed"" tag and improve his image with the public, Labour leader Ed Miliband has made a startling revelation. However, many experts believe that the news will do little to help him in his endeavors. At a recent press conference, Miliband announced that he had recently discovered that controversial politician George Galloway had been thrown out of the Labour party ten years ago. Galloway was expelled from the party following comments he made about the Iraq war, which were seen as divisive and damaging to the party's reputation. Miliband claimed that he had no knowledge of Galloway's past with the party until recently, and praised the decision to expel him. However, many political analysts are skeptical that this revelation will do much to improve Miliband's image. ""Frankly, I don't think anyone's going to see this as a game-changer,"" said political commentator John Smith. ""Most people won't even remember who George Galloway is, let alone care that he was expelled from the Labour party ten years ago."" Smith's sentiments were echoed by many others in the political world, who feel that Miliband is fighting an uphill battle when it comes to his public image. ""The fact of the matter is that Miliband has struggled to connect with the public since he became leader,"" said political strategist Sarah Johnson. ""He hasn't been able to shake the 'Red Ed' label, and while this revelation might be interesting from a historical perspective, I don't think it's going to have much of an impact on his current standing with the public."" Indeed, recent polls show that Miliband's approval rating remains stubbornly low, with many voters saying they simply don't find him charismatic or inspiring. Despite this, Miliband has remained upbeat in recent weeks, launching a strong campaign against Conservative plans to cut welfare benefits and implementing new policies aimed at improving the lives of ordinary people. ""It's true that I have a lot of work to do when it comes to my public image,"" Miliband admitted in a recent interview. ""But I'm confident that if I keep focusing on the issues that matter to people, and keep putting forward strong policies that will make a real difference in their lives, I can turn things around."" Whether or not his strategy will be successful remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Miliband will need to work hard to shake the ""Red Ed"" tag and win over the hearts and minds of the British public.","(487, 16)","By.

Revelation will do nothing for Miliband trying to shake ‘Red Ed’ tag
George Galloway was kicked out of the party 10 years ago
Labour leader Ed Miliband has been dealt a fresh blow after it emerged that his father Ralph was a member of the Communist Party in the 1940s.
The revelation will do nothing to help Mr Miliband’s attempts to shake off his ‘Red Ed’ image as he seeks to become Prime Minister.
Mr Miliband’s father, who died in 1994, joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1941 and remained a member until 1956, when he resigned in protest at the Soviet Union’s suppression of the Hungarian uprising.
Ed Miliband's father Ralph was a communist in the 40s and 50s
Ed Miliband’s father Ralph was a Communist Party member from 1941 to 1956
The Mail on Sunday can also reveal that Mr Miliband’s uncle, David Miliband, was also a member of the CPGB between 1965 and 1968, when he was a student at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for Mr Miliband said last night: ‘Ralph Miliband joined the Communist Party in 1941. He left the party in 1956 in protest at the invasion of Hungary.’
He added: ‘Ed Miliband has never been a member of any political party other than the Labour Party.’
It is understood that Mr Miliband did not know about his father’s membership of the CPGB until after he became Labour leader in 2010.
Mr Miliband senior was born in Poland in 1924 and came to Britain as a refugee in 1940. He became a lecturer in politics at the London School of Economics in 1957 and later taught at the University of Leeds and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
He wrote several books, including Parliamentary Socialism (1961), The State In Capitalist Society (1969) and Marxism and Politics (1977). He died aged 69 in 1994.
Mr Miliband junior was born in London in 1969, the son of Ralph and Marion Kozak. His parents divorced when he was a child and he was brought up by his mother and stepfather Ralph Samuel, a professor of history at Birkbeck College, University of London.
Mr Miliband was educated at Haverstock Comprehensive School in Camden, north London, and studied philosophy, politics and economics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was president of the Oxford Union debating society.
After graduating in 1991, he worked as a special adviser to Gordon Brown when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was elected MP for Doncaster North in 2005 and became leader of the Labour Party in September 2010.
His elder brother, David, served as Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2006 to 2007 and Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change from 2008 to 2010. He was Foreign Secretary from 2007 to 2010 under Gordon Brown.

(CNN) -- Nigeria's president has backed down on his decision to suspend the national soccer
","(CNN) -- Nigeria's president has backed down on his decision to suspend the national soccer team, according to the African country's football federation. The announcement came just before Monday's deadline set by world governing body FIFA, which had threatened to expel Nigeria completely if the ruling was not overturned and also withhold $8 million due for participating at the World Cup. Nigerian leader Goodluck Jonathan was so angry with the Super Eagles' poor performance in South Africa that he decided to suspend the national team at all levels for two years. ""The President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, on Monday graciously rescinded last Wednesday's decision to withdraw Nigerian national football teams from FIFA/CAF football competitions,"" the federation said in a statement. ""The decision was made known at the presidential villa on Monday evening as President Jonathan hearkened to the passionate appeals of top officials of the National Sports Commission, the Nigeria Football Federation, other concerned organs of government and well-meaning Nigerians on the matter."" Nigerian leader's 'Obama moment' Nine members of the NFF's executive committee had earlier been dismissed, including president Sani Lulu and vice-president Amanze Uchegbulam, the UK Press Association reported on Monday. After hearing of Jonathan's June 30 decision, FIFA wrote to the NFF on Friday warning it of the possible ramifications if the Monday deadline was not met. Two-time African champions Nigeria finished bottom of Group B at the World Cup after one draw and two defeats. The Super Eagles brought in former Sweden coach Lars Lagerback after finishing third at the Africa Cup of Nations in January, but he was unable to lift the team's fortunes in matches against Argentina, Greece and South Korea.","(327, 9)","In a recent turn of events, the ban on Nigeria's national football team has been rescinded by the African country's president. President Goodluck Jonathan had initially imposed the ban on all Nigerian national teams for two years following the Super Eagles' poor showing at the World Cup in South Africa. However, world governing body FIFA had given Nigeria a Monday deadline to overturn the decision. The ban had sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from football enthusiasts and stakeholders alike. Many believed that it was a harsh and unjustifiable punishment that could harm the development of football in Nigeria. The country has produced many talented footballers over the years and has a passionate fan base that supports the national team through thick and thin. Fortunately, President Jonathan has now heeded the call to reverse the ban, signaling a welcome relief to the Nigerian football community. The decision to lift the ban was a wise one; it provides an opportunity for the Super Eagles to bounce back from their disappointment at the World Cup and start a new era. Additionally, it demonstrates the government's commitment to supporting the sport in the country. The Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) has also welcomed the decision to overturn the ban. The federation's president, Amaju Pinnick, praised President Jonathan for his proactivitiy and responsiveness to the plight of Nigerian football. Speaking to reporters, Pinnick said, ""We are thrilled to have the ban lifted. This is a new beginning for Nigerian football, and we are confident that we can regain our rightful place on the global football stage."" In conclusion, the rescinding of the ban on Nigeria's national football team is good news for football enthusiasts not just in Nigeria, but the world over. It sends a strong message of support for the sport and provides an opportunity for the Super Eagles to chart a new course towards greater success.","(350, 15)","(CNN) -- Nigeria's president has backed down on his decision to suspend the national soccer
team from international competition for two years.
President Goodluck Jonathan made the announcement in a televised address to the nation on
Monday, just hours before FIFA, soccer's world governing body, was due to decide whether to
impose its own ban on the West African nation.
""I have decided to lift the suspension of the Super Eagles,"" Jonathan said. ""I have also
decided to lift the ban on all other national teams.""
FIFA had given Nigeria until Monday to overturn Jonathan's decision or face a two-year
suspension from all international competitions, including the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
Jonathan had been furious after the Super Eagles failed to win a single game at the World
Cup in South Africa last year, finishing bottom of their group with just one point from three
matches. The team's dismal performance led to widespread criticism of the players and the
Nigerian Football Federation (NFF), who were accused of failing to prepare the team properly
for the tournament.
In response, Jonathan ordered the NFF to suspend all national teams from international
competition for two years. He also called for the resignation of the federation's president,
Alhaji Aminu Maigari.
However, the NFF refused to comply with the president's order, arguing that it did not have
the legal authority to do so. The matter was then taken to court, where a judge ruled that
the NFF could not be forced to suspend the national teams.
Despite this setback, Jonathan remained determined to punish the NFF for its failure to
prepare the Super Eagles properly for the World Cup. He even went so far as to threaten to
dissolve the federation if it did not comply with his order.
However, it seems that the president has now changed his mind. In his televised address, he
said that he had decided to lift the suspensions because he wanted to give the NFF a chance
to improve the performance of the national teams.
""I believe that the NFF has learned from its mistakes and is now taking steps to ensure that
the national teams are better prepared for future tournaments,"" Jonathan said.
It remains to be seen whether the NFF will be able to turn things around and improve the
performance of the national teams. However, it is clear that the president's decision to lift
the suspensions has given the federation a new lease of life.

The Virginia man who pleaded guilty to shooting a Family Research Council employee last year
","The Virginia man who pleaded guilty to shooting a Family Research Council employee last year was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison. Floyd Corkins has said he disagreed with the Family Research Council's stance against gay marriage. The shooting took place at the conservative policy group's office in Washington. The research council, a Christian group that focuses on family, anti-abortion and religious liberty issues, views homosexuality as harmful. Before sentencing, Corkins expressed remorse to building manager Leo Johnson, who Corkins shot in the arm. ""I realize resorting to violence to achieve political ends is never OK,"" Corkins said. Johnson, who struggled with Corkins and disarmed him, also spoke before the sentencing. ""I forgive you but I do not forget,"" he said. ""If you believe in God you should pray to him every day because not only did God save my life that day, he saved yours, too."" Johnson said he didn't shoot Corkins after managing to get control of the gun because God spoke to him and told him not to do so. Corkins, 29, pleaded guilty in February to committing an act of terrorism while armed, assault with intent to kill while armed and interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition. David Bos, Corkins' federal public defender, said his client was diagnosed with a mental illness six months before the August 2012 shooting and starting taking prescribed medication. Bos said that didn't excuse the shooting but should be taken into account.  The lawyer recommended Corkins receive a sentence of 11 years and three months. Prosecutors argued Corkins should receive 45 years in prison. The government said Corkins did suffer from mental illness but wanted to take medication only so he could think more clearly about his plot. Prosecutors said Corkins was able to carefully plan, rehearse and then conduct his attack. If Johnson had not interceded, they argued, many people at the Family Research Council might have been killed or wounded. ""Earlier this week we were reminded what the consequences can be of one man well-armed,"" said prosecutor Patrick Martin. ""Mr. Corkins was no less determined than the Navy Yard gunman."" When Corkins was arrested investigators found 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches in his backpack.  He told the FBI he planned to kill as many people as he could at the research council and then smash the sandwiches in their faces. The head of Chick-fil-A had announced opposition to gay marriage. ""Today's 25-year prison sentence demonstrates the steep price to be paid for turning to violence to terrorize your political enemies,"" said U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen.","(489, 24)","In 2012, a tragic shooting occurred at the headquarters of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian organization based in Washington, D.C. The shooter, a man named Floyd Corkins, entered the building armed with a gun and hatred in his heart. He disagreed vehemently with the council's stance against gay marriage and had planned to carry out a deadly attack. However, he was stopped in his tracks by a brave young man named Leo Johnson. Johnson, who was working as a security guard at the time, physically tackled Corkins and disarmed him. In a moment of extraordinary courage, he prevented a potentially catastrophic loss of life. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Johnson was hailed as a hero. But despite the trauma and danger he had faced, he expressed an inspirational message of compassion and forgiveness. Speaking to the media, he said: ""I forgive him, but I do not forget."" It was a powerful message that set an example of Christian love and grace in the face of evil. The incident highlighted the extreme divisions and tensions that exist in American society over social issues like same-sex marriage. The Family Research Council is a conservative organization that advocates for traditional values and Biblical teachings on marriage, family, and morality. They take a strong stance against the LGBT community and their efforts to gain equal rights. Corkins, who was openly gay himself, had been motivated by a twisted ideology of hatred and resentment towards those who disagreed with his views. His actions were a shocking reminder of the potential for violence and fanaticism on both sides of the issue. In the years since the shooting, the Family Research Council has continued to be a lightning rod for controversy and criticism. Many progressives and activists see them as a hateful and intolerant organization that spreads harmful messages of discrimination and prejudice. However, the council maintains that they are simply standing up for traditional morals and values that have been a part of the Christian faith for centuries. They argue that their advocacy for traditional marriage and family values is rooted in a deep concern for the well-being of society as a whole. The legacy of the shooting at the Family Research Council lives on as a reminder of the power of forgiveness and grace in the face of hatred and violence. Leo Johnson's words of forgiveness and determination are a testament to the loving heart of the Christian faith, even in the midst of great adversity. As we continue to grapple with issues of social justice and equality in our society, it is important to remember the example set by Johnson and other people of faith who choose to respond to anger and hate with love and forgiveness. Only by embracing these principles can we hope to build a better world for ourselves and our fellow human beings.","(526, 23)","The Virginia man who pleaded guilty to shooting a Family Research Council employee last year
has been sentenced to 25 years in prison.
Floyd Lee Corkins II, 28, of Herndon, Va., was sentenced Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.
Corkins pleaded guilty in October to three charges: interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition, assault with intent to kill while armed, and committing an act of terrorism while armed.
Corkins was arrested Aug. 15, 2012, after he entered the lobby of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group that opposes same-sex marriage, and opened fire on a security guard. The guard, Leo Johnson, was shot in the arm but managed to wrestle the gun away from Corkins and hold him until police arrived.
Corkins told investigators that he intended to kill as many people as possible and then smear the victims' faces with Chick-fil-A sandwiches to make a political statement about the fast-food chain's opposition to same-sex marriage, according to court documents.
Corkins also told investigators that he targeted the Family Research Council because it was listed as an anti-gay group on the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that monitors hate groups. The center has since removed the Family Research Council from its list of hate groups.
Corkins' attorney, David Bos, asked for a sentence of no more than 12 years in prison, saying his client suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism. Bos said Corkins did not intend to kill anyone when he went to the Family Research Council's offices.
But U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly called Corkins' actions ""cold, calculated and premeditated"" and said she had no choice but to sentence him to the maximum penalty allowed under federal law.
""This was not a spur-of-the-moment decision,"" she said. ""This was a decision that was made well in advance.""
Kollar-Kotelly also ordered Corkins to serve three years of supervised release after his prison term and to pay restitution to Johnson, who was injured in the shooting.
During the sentencing hearing, Johnson spoke directly to Corkins, telling him that he forgave him but that he would never forget what he had done.
""I wish you no harm,"" Johnson said. ""I want you to get the help you need.""","(437, 16)",,

Hertz is being sued by one of its customers after he was allegedly racially abused by employees of the car rental firm on Facebook. Maurice Howard, 27, filed the complaint against the firm last week after staff at Hertz Rent-A-Car at Maui Airport, Hawaii, took to the social networking site to insult him in Pidgin English after he had hired a vehicle there. Mr Howard's attorney, Burton Gould, described the employee's comments as a 'hate crime' in a statement. Legal action: A 27-year-old man is suing car hire firm Hertz over allegations that members of staff racially abused him on Facebook (file picture) The group of employees allegedly took to Facebook in February 2012 to describe Mr Howard as a pretentious black man who rented impressive cars including BMWs. They mocked Mr Howard claiming that his credit card was often declined. The posts use terminology that Mr Howard's lawyers claim imply that he is a black man of low social status who aspires, in a crude manner, to appear to be of higher status. A post by another employee, Samantha Chun, reads: 'Run that faka over!!! lol.' Suing: Maurice Howard is also attempting to sue Facebook claiming that is violated its anti-bullying policy by allowing the posts which appeared in February 2012 . One of the members of staff named in the law suit, Shawn Akina, allegedly described Mr Howard as a 'broke ass faka who act like he get planny money'. Mr Howard is also taking legal action against . Facebook claiming that the site violated its policy banning content that . could be seen as bullying or causing emotional distress. His lawyer claims that his client's civil rights were violated and cites negligence on the part of both Hertz and Facebook for allowing the group to mock him. According to the Huffington Post, the Lawsuit says: 'Clearly the posting attacking and bullying Howard is a prima facie case of Facebook's own definition of ""harmful content"". 'Moreover, these same individuals, continue to have accounts on Facebook, despite Facebook's policies which explicitly state that such ""harmful content"" being posted on Facebook is grounds an individual's account be terminated.' The group of employees were all either fired or resigned following the incident, according to the lawsuit. The posts were reportedly deleted once Mr Howard was made aware of them. Hawaii Pidgin English is a form of Creole language based on English and used by many residents of Hawaii in everyday conversation. It was originally used as a form of communication between English speaking residents and non English speakers and is influenced by a range of languages including Portuguese and Cantonese.

For those unfamiliar with local slang, this roughly translates to ""poor guy who acts like he has a lot of money."" The incident reportedly took place when Howard arrived at the Maui Airport Hertz to rent a vehicle. Howard, who is a successful businessman, says that he was dressed in casual clothing but had a designer handbag with him. According to Howard, the Hertz employees made fun of him for his appearance and accused him of trying to show off his wealth. ""It was a really humiliating experience,"" Howard told reporters. ""I couldn't believe that this was happening to me in 2021. It's just not acceptable."" Howard believes that he was targeted because of his race. He says that the employees he interacted with were all white and that he was the only black person in the rental office at the time. The incident has sparked outrage among members of the local community, with many calling for an investigation into Hertz's hiring and training practices. Some have also started a social media campaign using the hashtag #BoycottHertz, urging others to take their business elsewhere. Hertz has responded to the allegations, saying that they take the matter very seriously and are conducting an internal investigation.

When Mr. Howard replied that he had not, the employee allegedly made a derogatory comment about his race. Mr. Howard said that he was shocked and offended by the employee's behavior, and he decided to report the incident to the manager. The manager apologized to Mr. Howard and promised to investigate the matter. However, Mr. Howard was not satisfied with the manager's response, and he filed a complaint with the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission. The commission is currently investigating the incident to determine if there was any discrimination against Mr. Howard based on his race. If the commission finds that there was discrimination, it could result in fines or other penalties for the rental car company. This incident highlights the ongoing issue of racial discrimination in the United States. While progress has been made in recent years, there are still many instances of discrimination against people of color. It is important for companies to take steps to ensure that their employees are treated fairly and with respect, regardless of their race or ethnicity. In this case, it appears that the rental car company failed to do so, and they should be held accountable for their actions.","(338, 19)",,

The mask, which is known to have been worn by the on-screen villain, has been used to implicate 19-year-old Fabian Kramer in the brutal killing of his elderly landlady. According to court documents, Kramer was sentenced to ten years in prison after pleading guilty to the murder. The teen was found to have stabbed his landlady a shocking 50 times, in what prosecutors described as ""pure murderous lust."" The victim, who was in her 70s, was found by a neighbor who came to check on her after noticing her front door was left open.

""The defendant chose to emulate a fictional killer, and as a result, a real person lost their life,"" the prosecutor said in his closing argument. Kramer's defense team argued that their client had a history of mental illness and should be treated as such.

Mask of movie serial killer Hannibal Lecter used as exhibit in REAL-LIFE murder trial
Fabian Kramer, 19, has been sentenced to ten years in prison for the murder of his elderly landlady
Kramer stabbed her 50 times in an 'act of pure murderous lust'
A mask of the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lector was used as an exhibit in a real-life murder trial.
Fabian Kramer, now 19, was found guilty of stabbing his 72-year-old landlady to death in an act of 'pure murderous lust'.
He was sentenced to 10 years in prison after a court heard how he had stabbed her more than 50 times in the neck, chest and stomach.
The mask of the fictional character, played by Anthony Hopkins in the film Silence of the Lambs, was shown to the jury during the trial.
It was used as an example of the type of mask Kramer had been wearing when he attacked his victim.
Kramer, who was 17 at the time of the killing, had denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
He claimed he had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time.
But the court heard that he had made no attempt to call for help after the attack and had even tried to cover up his crime by setting fire to the victim's house.
Kramer had been living with the victim, named only as Mrs S, in her home in the town of Wuppertal, Germany, for several months before the attack.
The court heard that Kramer had become obsessed with the Hannibal Lecter character after watching the 1991 film starring Anthony Hopkins.
Prosecutors said Kramer had been wearing a mask similar to the one worn by Lecter in the film when he carried out the attack.
The mask was shown to the court during the trial.
The court also heard that Kramer had sent a text message to a friend shortly before the attack saying: 'I'm going to kill my landlady. I'm going to stab her to death.'
After the attack, Kramer set fire to Mrs S's house in an attempt to cover up the crime.
He then went to a local police station and told officers that he had been attacked by a group of men who had tied him up and forced him to set fire to the house.
Kramer was later arrested and charged with murder.
During the trial, the court heard evidence from a number of witnesses who had seen Kramer acting strangely in the days leading up to the attack.
One witness said he had seen Kramer walking around the town wearing a mask and carrying a knife.
Another witness said she had seen Kramer acting aggressively towards Mrs S in the days before the attack.
Kramer's defence team argued that he had been suffering from a mental illness at the time and was not responsible for his actions.
But the court rejected this argument and found Kramer guilty of murder.
Kramer will now serve a 10-year prison sentence.
The case has sparked outrage in Germany, with many people calling for the death penalty to be reintroduced in the country.
Some people have also called for the mask of Hannibal Lecter to be banned from being shown in public.
Others have argued that the case shows the need for better mental health services in Germany.
The case has also raised questions about the use of masks in films and other media.
Some people have argued that the use of masks can desensitise people to violence and make them more likely to commit acts of violence themselves.
However, others have argued that masks can be used to create a sense of fear and suspense, which can be beneficial in certain situations.
The case of Fabian Kramer is a tragic example of the dangers of mental illness and the need for better support for people who are struggling with their mental health.
It is also a reminder of the importance of being aware of the potential dangers of masks and other forms of media that may desensitise us to violence.

","By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 1:12 PM on 30th December 2011 . An aggressive species of crayfish which has been invading England's waterways is being tracked with radio transmitters in a bid to understand why they move so quickly - and help control their advance. The American predators have colonised the River Lee near Enfield, moving at more than 500m per month. The crayfish have now taken over 17km of the river. The Environment Agency said virile crayfish, which are non-native, prey on native wildlife and spread crayfish plague, a disease deadly to native white-clawed crayfish. It is believed that virile crayfish arrived in the UK after an aquarium owner released them into an east London pond. The predatory North American crayfish are believed to have escaped an aquarium in East London before colonising a river. Now they are being fitted with radio transmitters . The Environment Agency has fitted small radio transmitters on the backs of the unwelcome guests, with preliminary results showing that virile crayfish are moving upstream at a rate of 500 metres (1,640ft) per month. This is substantially faster than their cousin, the signal crayfish, which is also non-native. The UK's only native crayfish, the white clawed crayfish, was wiped out along the River Lee following the invasion of the signal crayfish in the 1980s and the associated spread of crayfish plague. Adam Ellis, environmental monitoring officer at the Environment Agency, said: 'Whilst rivers in England and Wales are cleaner than they have been for decades, there is still a lot to be done in order to return them to full health. This includes the control of invasive species like virile crayfish.' I fought the claw and the claw won: Undated Environment Agency handout photo of Inger Jennings, Environmental Monitoring Officer with a virile (right) and signal crayfish (left) 'By tracking the colonisation of the River Lee by virile crayfish, we will better understand how this species impacts the environment and our native wildlife.' 'However, one of the most important ways to protect our wildlife is to stop the spread of non-native invasive species. We're appealing to the public not to release unwanted pets into the wild.' Anyone who catches a crayfish must follow strict guidelines on how to handle them in order to prevent their spread and the transmission of crayfish plague. The rise of invasive species is a major challenge in meeting tough new EU targets on the ecology of rivers and lakes. They cost the UK economy an estimated £1.7 billion every year, according to the Environment Agency.","(475, 21)","A river in Enfield, north London, is being taken over by American signal crayfish. These invasive species are moving at an alarming rate of 500 meters a month, and are causing devastation to the ecosystem of the Enfield waterway. These crayfish have been introduced to the UK in the 1970s but due to their aggressive nature they have out-competed native crayfish and decimated their population. Not only do they eat native wildlife, they also spread a lethal plague that can kill off other aquatic life. This lethal disease was first discovered at a waterway in Norfolk in 2014 and has been spreading across the UK ever since.  Experts suggest that the signal crayfish are devastating aquatic ecosystems across the country, causing a significant decline in biodiversity. They believe that these predators have an insatiable appetite, which means that they'll eat almost anything they encounter in the waterway. This includes native crayfish, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates, and even small mammals if they're hungry enough. This invasive species is not just causing problems for wildlife, it is also having an impact on the economy of Enfield. The crayfish are also causing damage to the river banks and are interfering with recreational activities such as fishing, boating, and swimming. Local authorities are working to control the population of signal crayfish in the area, but it’s an uphill battle. There is no simple solution to controlling the spread of signal crayfish. The best way to prevent them from spreading is to avoid releasing them into rivers in the first place. But unfortunately, many people continue to release signal crayfish into rivers as a means of controlling the populations of other invasive species such as zebra mussels. The Enfield council is taking action, advising locals to avoid introducing any foreign or invasive species into the local waterways. Additionally, they are creating reserves and safe havens for the native critters living in the river—all with the aim of ensuring that they are protected in their natural habitat. Despite the challenges, conservationist remain optimistic. There are signs of recovery in other parts of the world, where communities have worked together to eradicate and control the spread of these predators. With local authorities and the community working together, it's possible to protect the biodiversity of Enfield's waterways from further damage caused by the predatory nature of the invasive signal crayfish. Overall, the future of the region's natural inhabitants hangs in the balance, and everyone must work towards finding an effective solution to keep the environment safe and thriving.","(469, 20)","By.

Predatory American crayfish have taken over a river in Enfield, eating native wildlife and spreading lethal crayfish plague.
The crustaceans are moving at a rate of up to 500 meters per month along the River Lea, according to a study by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).
Crayfish plague is a fungal disease which can wipe out entire populations of native crayfish. It was brought to Europe from North America in the late 1800s, and has since wiped out native crayfish populations across the continent.
Native crayfish populations in the River Lea have already been decimated by the plague, and the American crayfish now pose a threat to other native species, including otters, water voles and birds such as kingfishers and herons.
The ZSL and CEH study found that the American crayfish were moving upstream at a rate of between 200 and 500 meters per year, and could reach the source of the River Lea within 20 years.
The study also found that the crayfish were having a significant impact on the ecology of the river, with native crayfish populations reduced by up to 90% in areas where the American crayfish had established themselves.
The researchers called for urgent action to be taken to control the spread of the American crayfish, including the use of traps and barriers to prevent them from moving upstream.
They also called for more research to be carried out into the impact of the crayfish on native species, and the development of new methods to control their spread.
The study was published in the journal Freshwater Biology.","(310, 13)",,

Mackenzie, who was leading a photography tour, said the cubs were a ""team of mischief and energy."" The images capture the playful nature of these creatures as they explore their surroundings. The polar bear cubs can be seen energetically wrestling with one another, rolling around in the snow and even appearing to dance for the camera. Polar bears are apex predators in the Arctic and are considered to be threatened, with their populations declining due to climate change and habitat loss. However, conservation groups have been working to protect these animals, with efforts focused on reducing carbon emissions and protecting their habitat. The stunning images captured by Colin Mackenzie are a testament to the beauty and importance of these animals. Mackenzie, who has been photographing wildlife for over 20 years, said the experience of photographing these cubs was unmatched. ""It was an incredible experience to observe these cubs up close and watch them play and interact with each other,"" he said. ""They were a team of mischief and energy, always exploring and pushing the boundaries of their environment. It was a joy to capture these images and share them with the world."" Mackenzie's images are a reminder of the importance of conservation efforts to protect the Arctic's fragile ecosystem. Climate change is having a severe impact on this region, with rising temperatures causing the Arctic sea ice to melt and food sources for polar bears becoming scarcer. But despite the challenges facing the polar bear population, the cubs captured in Mackenzie's breathtaking images are a sign of hope for the future. Through continued conservation efforts, we can ensure that these magnificent creatures continue to thrive in their natural habitats for generations to come. In conclusion, Mackenzie has showcased his exceptional photography skills by capturing the polar bear cubs in their natural habitat. These magnificent creatures continue to demand attention and protection amidst the climate change crisis. The images serve as a reminder of the importance of preserving and protecting our natural world.","(420, 19)","It seems this polar bear cub was desperate to be the centre of attention. Colin

","(CNN) -- South Korea on Wednesday announced sanctions against Iran -- including government scrutiny of most financial transactions involving the country -- as part of global efforts to quash Tehran's suspected nuclear program. A key Iranian bank also will face ""a heavy penalty,"" said South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Kim Young-sun, according to state media. The Seoul branch of Iran's Bank Mellat has allegedly facilitated hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions for Iranian nuclear, missile and defense agencies, the Yonhap news agency said. Korea also will expand a sanctions blacklist to limit the foreign-exchange transactions of more than 100 people and Iranian entities; step up inspections of suspicious cargo to and from Iran; put those blacklisted on a travel ban; and limit investments in Iran's gas and oil refinery industries. The blacklisted entities include Bank Mellat, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, according to Yonhap. The United States, a key South Korean ally, has lobbied other nations to step up sanctions against Iran. The European Union, Canada and Japan are among those that have done so. Iran is continuing its uranium enrichment activities in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to a report released Monday by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran has rebuffed international demands to halt its uranium enrichment program, saying it wants the nuclear fuel for peaceful uses. The IAEA is not convinced. In low concentrations, enriched uranium can be used to fuel civilian power plants, but in extremely high concentrations, it can be used to produce a nuclear bomb. ""Based on an overall analysis undertaken by the agency of all the information available to it, the agency remains concerned about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed nuclear-related activities involving military-related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile,"" the IAEA report said. Last month, the United States extended sanctions against Iran, saying it was targeting a number of Iranian businesses and groups accused of helping organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Taliban. In June, the United Nations imposed some of its toughest sanctions yet of Iran. The new sanctions include cargo inspections, new controls on Iranian banks, restrictions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a new U.N. panel of experts to help monitor and enforce sanctions, and asset freezes on 40 entities and individuals. Also in June, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions targeting the country's nuclear and missile programs, identifying more than 20 companies and several individuals allegedly involved with those programs.","(483, 16)","The United States is pushing for increased sanctions against Iran amidst concerns that the country may be enriching uranium to build a nuclear bomb. As part of its efforts, the U.S. is calling on other countries to join in its efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. One of the measures being proposed by the U.S. includes increased scrutiny of financial transactions involving Iran. This is meant to deny the Iranian government access to the funds needed to develop its nuclear program. In addition to financial scrutiny, the U.S. is also calling for increased cargo inspections to prevent the movement of materials that could be used to build nuclear weapons. Iran has consistently denied allegations that it is developing nuclear weapons, stating that its nuclear program is aimed solely at producing energy for its citizens. The country has defied U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for it to halt its uranium enrichment program, leading to increased tensions with the international community. Despite international pressure, Iran has continued to pursue its nuclear program, even as it faces economic sanctions from the United States and other countries. The U.S. has been lobbying other countries to join in its efforts to increase pressure on Iran, with some success. In response to the U.S. campaign, some countries have already taken steps to reduce their imports of Iranian oil and other goods. The European Union has also imposed a number of economic sanctions on Iran, including restrictions on access to its banking system. Iran has dismissed these efforts as being based on unfounded suspicions and biased information. It has instead called for a more equal and respectful dialogue with the international community to resolve the issue of its nuclear program. Despite the ongoing tensions between Iran and the U.S., some experts believe that a peaceful resolution to the situation is still possible. They argue that dialogue and diplomacy offer the best path forward, and that increasing sanctions and military threats will only serve to escalate the conflict. For now, however, it seems that the U.S. and other countries will continue to pursue increased sanctions and other measures to pressure Iran to abandon its nuclear program. Whether or not these efforts will be successful remains to be seen.","(401, 17)","(CNN) -- South Korea on Wednesday announced sanctions against Iran -- including government scrutiny of
financial transactions and cargo inspections -- as part of an international effort to pressure Tehran over its nuclear program.
The U.S. has been lobbying other countries to increase sanctions against Iran, which has defied United Nations Security Council resolutions and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, by continuing to enrich uranium.
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday that the U.S. was ""very pleased"" with South Korea's decision.
""We are very pleased that South Korea has decided to join the international community in imposing sanctions on Iran,"" Rice told reporters in Washington. ""We hope that other countries will do the same.""
South Korean Foreign Minister Song Min-soon said his country had decided to impose sanctions because of Iran's refusal to cooperate with the IAEA.
""We have decided to impose sanctions on Iran for its failure to comply with the international community's demand to suspend its uranium enrichment activities,"" Song said in a statement released by his ministry.
Song said the sanctions would include government scrutiny of financial transactions between South Korea and Iran, as well as inspections of Iranian cargo passing through South Korean ports.
He also said South Korea would stop issuing new export licenses for items that could be used in Iran's nuclear and missile programs.
Iran has dismissed Western suspicions that it is using its nuclear program to build a bomb, saying it wants to generate electricity.
But the IAEA has accused Iran of failing to cooperate with its investigation into the country's nuclear program.
The IAEA said in a report last month that it had found traces of highly enriched uranium at an Iranian nuclear facility, suggesting that Iran may have tried to develop a nuclear weapon.
Iran has denied the allegations, saying the highly enriched uranium was the result of contamination from imported equipment.
The IAEA has called on Iran to suspend all uranium enrichment activities, but the country has refused to do so.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said his country will continue to pursue its nuclear program, regardless of what the international community says.
The United States and its allies have threatened to take military action against Iran if it does not halt its nuclear program.","(428, 16)",,

","By . Ted Thornhill . A Spanish cyclist was saddled with acute embarrassment after he passionately celebrated winning a Tour of California stage – without realizing he had one lap to go. Eloy Teruel screamed and pumped his fists in the air as he crossed what he thought was the finishing line of the prestigious event’s penultimate seventh stage in Pasadena. But his unbridled joy quickly turned to humiliation as it became apparent that Saturday’s race wasn’t over. There was another lap of a 3.1mile (five kilometre) circuit left to pedal around. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Oops: Eloy Teruel mistakenly raises his arms, thinking he had won the seventh stage of the Tour of California in Pasadena on Saturday . However, the Spaniard saw the funny side, and tweeted: ‘I wanted to win, luckily no one has seen. Hahahahaha.’ He joins a long list of sports stars who've celebrated prematurely, which includes Alex Cujavante coasting towards the finishing line during the 2010 Roller Speed Skating Championships in Colombia with his arms raised in victory, only to be overtaken in the final few yards and Lindsey Jacobellis indulging in a victory 'tail-grab' in the 2006 Winter Olympics snowboard cross - only to fall over before the finishing line. The real winner: Peter Sagan, left, of Slovakia . Wheel-y fast: Bradley Wiggins (centre) was the overall winner of the Tour of California . Cheeky: Bradley Wiggins receives congratulatory kisses as the overall winner of the Tour of California . Overall victory of the event went to former Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins, with fellow Briton Mark Cavendish sprinting to the final-stage win. Wiggins came home in the front group at the end of the hilly 76.1-mile (121.7-kilometre) eighth stage to finish the race in Thousand Oaks 30 seconds ahead of Rohan Dennis (Garmin-Sharp) and claim his first win of the season. And he paid tribute to the team-mates who supported him over the three ascents of the Rock Store climb. Scenic: The peloton climbs the foothills of Mount Hamilton during stage three of the 2014 Tour of California from San Jose to Mount Diablo . Wiggins said on the Team Sky website: ‘I say it every day, but without those guys I wouldn't be in this position. 'You can't do it on your own and, as strong as my performance was individually in the time trial, my team have taken the strain all week. ‘Those young Americans in my team, Joe (Dombrowski), Ian (Boswell) and Danny (Pate) have done a fantastic job. Even today they didn't give up the chase and came back after they'd been distanced on the climbs. This is a fantastic way to finish.’","(514, 22)","In a stunning turn of events at Stage 7 of the Tour of California, Eloy Teruel of Spain prematurely celebrated his victory before the race was over. Teruel, who rides for the Movistar Team, thought he had successfully crossed the finish line and immediately pumped his arms in the air in triumph. However, to his dismay, there was actually one more lap to go on the course that he had not completed. Teruel was not the only rider caught off guard by the course's length as other cyclists also slowed down, thinking that the race was over. Teruel ultimately finished in 56th place, a significant drop from his momentary position as the frontrunner of the race. The actual winner of the Stage 7 event was Levi Leipheimer of the United States, who rode for the Astana team. Britain's Bradley Wiggins, however, clinched the overall victory of the Tour of California, securing his place in cycling history with a remarkable achievement. Wiggins, who had previously won the Tour de France in 2012, demonstrated once again his dominance in the sport of cycling. The Team Sky rider completed the grueling 720-mile course in just under 28 hours, winning by a comfortable margin of 30 seconds over runner-up Rohan Dennis of Australia, who rode for the Garmin-Sharp team. Wiggins' win in the Tour of California, which took place over eight days across diverse terrain throughout the state, solidifies his place as one of the most accomplished cyclists of his generation. He has won numerous prestigious titles throughout his career, including several Olympic gold medals, in addition to being one of the most recognizable figures in the sport. Despite the disappointment of Teruel's premature celebration, the Tour of California drew massive crowds and was an exciting celebration of cycling sport. From the steep mountain trails to the arid flats, cyclists from across the world tested their skills against challenging terrain and skilled opponents. The Tour of California has become an essential event on the cycling calendar, drawing talented riders from all over the world to compete in one of the sport's most demanding challenges. As the world of cycling continues to grow and evolve, events like the Tour of California will continue to showcase the best and brightest riders in the sport, as well as providing thrilling spectacles for fans both in person and around the world.","(437, 15)","By.

(CNN) -- Kenya's bar association is calling for the prosecution of men who publicly strip
","(CNN) -- Kenya's bar association is calling for the prosecution of men who publicly strip women because of the way they dress. ""The ongoing brutality that is stripping our women in public for allegedly dressing in an indecent manner must be brought to an end,"" Eric Mutua, chairman of the Law Society of Kenya, said in a statement. Mutua urged Keriako Tobiko, director of public prosecutions, to take action and for the national police to form a special unit to patrol areas where these crimes are likely to happen. ""These kinds of actions are not only illegal but immoral by all standards and should never be tolerated or condoned in a civilized society,"" Mutua said. In an recent incident, a group of men stripped a woman naked in Nairobi after accusing her of ""indecent"" dressing. The attack was captured on video and prompted outrage on social media under the hashtag #mydressmychoice. In footage posted on YouTube and shown on local television, attackers confronted the woman at a bus stop. The men pushed and shoved her, eventually stripping her naked. In the background, attackers yell ""Toa"" -- Swahili for ""take it off!"" -- as they tug at her clothes. Kenyans took to the streets of Nairobi on November 17 to protest the attacks. Protesters marched through the capital's downtown carrying placards that read ""My dress, my choice,"" while others donned miniskirts, the same attire the unidentified woman wore when she was attacked. Some men wore dresses to show their support. More iReport photos: #MyDressMyChoice . It is not the first time a woman has been undressed for purported indecent dressing in the East African nation, which is a majority Christian. After the videotaped incident, other instances of women getting undressed were reported, including in Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city. The issue in not limited to Kenya. Over the years, there have been similar occurrences elsewhere in Africa, including Malawi, Cameroon and Zimbabwe. Kenyan authorities have said they are investigating the incidents. CNN's Daisy Carrington and Rachel Rodriguez contributed to this report.","(399, 20)","The chairman of a local Kenyan human rights organization has spoken out against a recent incident that has caused outrage both in Kenya and around the world. In a statement, the chairman condemned the actions of a group of men who were caught on video stripping a woman in Nairobi. ""These kinds of actions are not only illegal but immoral by all standards,"" the chairman said. ""We condemn this act and call for the perpetrators to be brought to justice."" The video, which was posted on social media earlier this month, shows a group of men surrounding a woman and forcibly removing her clothes. The attack has sparked outrage in Kenya, where many have taken to social media using the hashtag #mydressmychoice to express their solidarity with the victim and to call for an end to violence against women. The incident has also brought attention to the issue of sexual harassment and gender-based violence in Kenya. According to recent data, more than one in three women in the country has experienced some form of sexual or physical abuse. In response to the attack, several organizations and activists have called for increased efforts to combat gender-based violence in Kenya. Many have also called for the government to take action to ensure that women are protected from such attacks. ""We need to see stronger measures in place to prevent and respond to gender-based violence,"" said one activist. ""This kind of behavior is simply unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue."" The incident has also raised concerns about the role of social media in reporting and responding to incidents of violence. While many have praised the use of social media in raising awareness of the attack, some have also expressed concern about the potential for further harm to victims. ""We need to be careful about how we use social media in these cases,"" said one commentator. ""While it can be a powerful tool for raising awareness and encouraging action, we also need to ensure that we protect the privacy and safety of victims."" As the investigation into the attack continues, many are hoping that the perpetrators will be brought to justice and that the incident will serve as a reminder of the urgent need to address the issue of gender-based violence in Kenya.","(423, 17)","(CNN) -- Kenya's bar association is calling for the prosecution of men who publicly strip
and humiliate women, after a video of men doing just that went viral on social media.
The video, which has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Twitter, shows a group of men
stripping a woman in broad daylight in Nairobi, Kenya's capital. In the video, one of the
men can be heard saying, ""This is what you get when you dress like a prostitute.""
The bar association's chairman, Nelson Havi, said in a statement that the men's actions were
""not only illegal but also immoral by all standards.""
Havi called on the Kenyan government to investigate the incident and bring the perpetrators
to justice. He also urged the public to report any similar incidents to the authorities.
The incident has sparked outrage on social media, with many Kenyans using the hashtag
#MyDressMyChoice to express their anger and frustration. Some have called for the men to be
arrested and prosecuted, while others have demanded that the government do more to protect
women from such attacks.
The Kenyan government has yet to comment on the incident. However, President Uhuru Kenyatta
has previously spoken out against gender-based violence, saying that it has no place in
Kenya. He has also launched a campaign to raise awareness about the issue and to encourage
men to take a stand against it.
The incident is just the latest in a series of high-profile cases of gender-based violence
in Kenya. Last year, a man was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a seven-year-old
girl. And in 2018, a woman was killed by her husband after she refused to have sex with him.
Gender-based violence is a serious problem in Kenya and around the world. According to the
World Health Organization, one in three women worldwide has experienced physical or sexual
violence in her lifetime. In Kenya, the situation is even worse, with one in two women
reporting having experienced some form of gender-based violence.
There are many factors that contribute to gender-based violence, including poverty, lack of
education, and traditional gender roles. However, one of the most important factors is
gender inequality. When women are not treated as equal to men, they are more likely to be
victims of violence. This is why it is so important for governments and societies to work
together to promote gender equality and to protect women from violence.
The incident in Nairobi is a reminder that gender-based violence is still a serious problem
in Kenya. It is also a reminder that we all have a role to play in ending it. We can start
by speaking out against it and by supporting organizations that work to protect women from
violence. We can also demand that our governments do more to address the root causes of
gender-based violence, such as poverty and gender inequality. By working together, we can
make a difference and create a world where women are safe and respected.","(559, 26)",,

","By . Adam Shergold . PUBLISHED: . 11:42 EST, 18 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:42 EST, 18 November 2012 . Henry was meant to be a miniature pony - but he was getting bigger and bigger by the minute. The owners of the two-foot tall pony just couldn't figure out why he had become so bad-tempered, until they noticed his stomach was all bloated. It wasn't the result of eating too much hay, however, that was causing the problem, but Henry's strange habit of swallowing sand. Snacking on sand: Henry the 2ft high Shetland pony became ill after grazing on sand in an all-weather paddock . He had been left to exercise in an outdoor all-weather paddock and, it seemed, had taken to the taste of its grainy covering. Unfortunately, his new meal had blocked his large intestine and this was having an effect on his other organs. His owners and other horse-lovers rallied round to quickly raise £6,000 for life-saving treatment and Henry is now making a full recovery. Owner Caroline Howarth, from Coppull near Chorley, Lancashire, bought Henry when he was six months old for her eight-year-old daughter Madison. Escape artist: Henry, seen here with her eight-year-old owner Madison, needed emergency surgery to flush out the build-up of sand . 'As soon as I saw him I knew we had to have him,' Mrs Howarth said. 'But after a while we noticed his tummy was getting bigger and bigger. Day-in, day-out it just kept swelling. 'I thought he might need worming and I kept a firm control on his food intake. 'It did not stop and the vets took a blood sample which said his liver wasn't working properly. 'They gave him more tests and my horse insurance level of £1,000 ran out. 'We had to fund any future treatment ourselves.' Happy again: The miniature pony is now making a full recovery after the emergency treatment, which was paid for by local horse lovers . Fellow horse lovers at the Seven Stars Stables at Standish, where Henry lives, decided to raise money for treatment by going on a sponsored walk. Henry was taken to the Equine Hospital at the Leahurst Campus of the University of Liverpool, which specialises in rare illnesses and serious injuries to horses. Vets there decided to flush Henry's stomach and found a build up of sand was causing all the problems. They carried out surgery to save his life and placed him on a special diet as he recovers back to health. Mrs Howarth added: 'He is a cheeky little horse and at the horse hospital they had to put a notice on his stable saying he was an escape artist. 'He now has a special diet - but no sand!'","(515, 30)","In a heartwarming story of hope and determination, a tiny Shetland pony named Henry has made a full recovery after undergoing a £6,000 emergency operation. The pony, who lives in Lancashire, had been suffering from bad temper and an increasingly swollen stomach. Thankfully, a team of vets were able to diagnose the problem: Henry had swallowed a load of sand while grazing on an all-weather paddock, which had become lodged in his large intestine. The blockage was causing the pony significant discomfort and endangering his health. Despite the high cost of the operation, a group of horse lovers rallied together to raise the necessary funds. Their love and devotion to the animal proved to be a powerful force, as they were able to generate the money needed to save Henry's life. Following the operation, Henry has made a complete recovery and is now back to his old self. The pony's owner, Emma Robinson, shared her pride in the horse-loving community, stating that the support they received was overwhelming. “We just can't thank everyone enough,” Robinson said. “We're overwhelmed by the support we've had from people who we never knew before this happened. The love and devotion they have for Henry has just been incredible.” For Emma Robinson and her family, Henry is much more than just a horse – he is a beloved family member. The fact that so many people were willing to come together to help him during his time of need is a testament to the power of community and the love that people have for animals. The operation was carried out by experienced vets who cared for the pony throughout his recovery. They praised the community for their unwavering support and emphasised how life-changing this operation has been for Henry. “Henry's operation was very complex and required a lot of skill.” Said one of the vets. “We were determined to save him, and with the help of the local community, we were able to do just that. We're thrilled that Henry has made such a full recovery.” For Henry, life is once again filled with joy and playfulness. The pony's bad temper and swollen stomach are now just distant memories. The love and care of his community, combined with the skills of dedicated veterinary professionals, saved Henry's life and restored him to his former self. This story is a shining example of the power of human kindness and the special bond between animals and their caretakers.","(466, 20)","By. Adam Shergold. PUBLISHED:. 11:42 EST, 18 November 2012. |.

This is a very good response. You have included all of the key details from the highlights, and you have used them in the correct order. You have also included some extra information about the pony, which is good.
However, there are a few things that you could improve. First, you could add some more detail about the pony’s condition before the operation. For example, you could say that he was lethargic and had stopped eating. This would give the reader a better understanding of how serious the situation was.
Second, you could use a more formal tone in your writing. For example, instead of saying “horse lovers”, you could say “equine enthusiasts”. This would make your writing sound more professional.
Finally, you could check your spelling and grammar. There are a few mistakes in your response, which could be confusing for the reader.

The leader of a U.S. Army small-kill team has been charged with two counts of murder for allegedly killing two deaf, unarmed Iraqi boys in a small Iraqi village in March of 2007. Former Staff Sergeant Michael Barbera has been charged by military prosecutors in the fatal shootings of  Ahmad Khalid al-Timmimi, 15, and his brother Abbas, 14, as the boys were tending cattle in a palm grove just outside As Sadah, about 50 miles northeast of Baghdad. Additionally, the 31-year-old Barbera 'lying to his commanders, directing fellow soldiers to lie to military . investigators and making a threatening phone call to a civilian in an . effort to keep what happened from becoming public,' according to a report from the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Killer: Authorities say Sergeant Michael Barbera fatally shot two unarmed, deaf Iraqi boys in 2007 . Barbera led Charlie Troop, 5th Squadron of the 73rd Airborne Reconnaissance Regiment out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. At the time of the alleged murders, the squadron was involved in counterinsurgency operations in the Diyala province. That's when military officials say Barbera fatally shot the two boys before lying to his superiors about how they died. 'None of us feel good about this. But I'm glad that the Army is . doing the right thing,' Ken Katter, 46, of Saginaw, Mich., the . sniper assigned to Barbera's team, told the paper. 'Leader': Barbera led a small-kill team in the Army's 73rd Airborne Reconnaissance Regiment when the alleged murders took place . Katter is one of several soldiers who brought the killings to the attention of Army officials. Katter firmly believes that the shootings led to two truck bomb attacks two weeks later that killed 10 soldiers. According to the Trib, investigators who reviewed the case recommended that Barbera be charged with two counts of murder. However, those charges never made it to an Article 32 hearing. Instead, the paper reports, Barbera received a light reprimand and ultimately promoted. However, whistle-blowers like Katter and others spoke up against their former superior officer. 'All we ever asked was for someone to listen to us and give what we were concerned about — a fair hearing,' Katter said. Barbera was charged on Wednesday at Alaska's Fort Richardson with two counts of murder. He currently is in the process of being moved to Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, where he will undergo a formal arraignment.","(484, 30)","An ex-Marine from California, who was working as a contractor in Iraq, has been charged in the murder of two young boys, who were tending cattle in a grove. Sergeant Michael Barbera was indicted on two counts of murder, two counts of obstruction of justice, and two counts of making false statements to the authorities, according to a statement released Monday on the website of the US Department of Justice. The incident took place in March 2007, when Barbera was working as a private security contractor for a US firm operating in Iraq. According to court documents, Barbera allegedly shot and killed the two boys, aged 16 and 11, while they were working in a palm grove, about 150 miles north of Baghdad. He then reportedly covered up the killings by lying to his superiors. The indictment alleges that Barbera falsely claimed that he fired in self-defense after being attacked by a group of armed men. He also allegedly tried to dispose of evidence by hiding the murder weapons and fabricating evidence to support his story. The boys' families have called for justice, saying that they have waited for years to find out what really happened to their loved ones. ""We've been waiting for justice, and now we're finally getting it,"" said one family member. Barbera, who is now 35 years old, faces up to life in prison if convicted of the murder charges. The case highlights the issue of private security contractors operating in war zones. These contractors have been accused of killing civilians and committing other abuses, sometimes with impunity. In recent years, there have been calls for greater oversight and accountability for private contractors, particularly in war zones. The US government has been criticized for the use of private contractors, who have been accused of committing human rights abuses and other crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the US has taken steps to improve oversight of these contractors, abuses continue to occur. The case is being prosecuted by the US Department of Justice's National Security Division, with assistance from the FBI and the US Army Criminal Investigation Command.

Sergeant Michael Barbera has been charged with two counts of second-degree murder in connection with the fatal shooting of two teenage boys who were tending cattle in a Palm Grove. The incident took place on November 15th, 2013, when Sergeant Barbera allegedly shot and killed the two boys while they were grazing their cattle in a remote area of Palm Grove. According to authorities, Sergeant Barbera then attempted to cover up the crime by lying to his superiors about what had happened. This article will provide a detailed account of the events leading up to the shooting, as well as the subsequent investigation and charges brought against Sergeant Barbera.
On November 15th, 2013, Sergeant Michael Barbera was on patrol in Palm Grove when he came across two teenage boys, identified as John Doe and Jane Doe, who were tending their cattle in a nearby field. According to witnesses, Sergeant Barbera approached the boys and asked them what they were doing in the area. The boys reportedly told Sergeant Barbera that they were simply tending their cattle and had no intention of causing any trouble. However, Sergeant Barbera allegedly became agitated and demanded that the boys leave the area immediately. When the boys refused to comply, Sergeant Barbera pulled out his service weapon and fired several shots at them, killing both boys instantly.
After the shooting, Sergeant Barbera reportedly attempted to cover up his actions by telling his superiors that the boys had attacked him and that he had been forced to shoot them in self-defense. However, witnesses who were present at the scene of the shooting contradicted Sergeant Barbera’s version of events, stating that the boys had done nothing to provoke Sergeant Barbera and that he had shot them without warning. As a result of the conflicting accounts, an investigation was launched into the incident, and Sergeant Barbera was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
During the course of the investigation, it was discovered that Sergeant Barbera had a history of violent behavior and had previously been reprimanded for using excessive force while on duty. Additionally, it was revealed that Sergeant Barbera was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of his experiences in the military, which may have contributed to his aggressive behavior on the day of the shooting.
Based on the evidence gathered during the investigation, Sergeant Barbera was charged with two count s of second-degree murder. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. In addition to the criminal charges, Sergeant Barbera is also facing disciplinary action from the Palm Grove Police Department, which could result in his termination from the force.
The shooting of the two teenage boys in Palm Grove has sparked outrage among the local community, with many calling for Sergeant Barbera to be held accountable for his actions. The incident has also raised concerns about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers and the need for better training and support for officers who may be suffering from PTSD or other mental health issues.
As the investigation into the shooting continues, it remains to be seen whether Sergeant Barbera will be found guilty of the charges brought against him. However, it is clear that this tragic incident has had a profound impact on the community of Palm Grove and has highlighted the need for greater accountability and transparency in law enforcement.","(637, 25)",,

New York (CNN) -- A New York judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed by
","New York (CNN) -- A New York judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed by a group of atheists, ruling that a pair of World Trade Center beams in the shape of a cross can be included in a memorial museum of the 9/11 terror attacks. American Atheists filed the lawsuit in July, arguing that the ""government enshrinement of the cross"" was an impermissible mingling of church and state. The World Trade Center cross, two intersecting steel beams that held up when the twin towers collapsed on September 11, 2001, is seen as iconic to some. In 2011: Cross moved to permanent 9/11 Memorial site . The cross was moved in July from near a church to its new home at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, located at ground zero in Lower Manhattan. Father Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest who ministered to workers clearing the area after the attacks, led a ceremonial blessing of the cross. Federal Judge Deborah Batts of the Southern District of New York ruled Thursday that display of the beams is permissible because they bear historical importance. Note lets family know 9/11 victim went down fighting . Named defendants included the museum, New Jersey, the city of New York, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. ""The museum is gratified by the decision,"" Mark Alcott, the lawyer for the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, told CNN on Friday. ""The plan has been to display this as one of hundreds and hundreds of artifacts ... because it is part of the history of the recovery efforts after the 911 attacks. ""For some of these people, [the cross] had symbolic significance,"" he continued, referring to first responders. ""They treated it as a religious object and it gave them a great deal of comfort at a difficult time. The 9/11 museum is simply depicting what happened."" David Silverman, president of American Atheists, told CNN, ""We are angry that we have to have this fight."" Silverman said it was clear that the cross was regarded as sacred, noting that it ""was installed in a religious service on consecrated ground by a priest. How anyone could say that is secular is beyond me."" September 11 ""affected all Americans, not just Christians,"" Silverman continued. ""We will not sit and let the 500 atheists who died on 9/11 go unnoticed."" Silverman said his group plans to appeal the decision. ""We are confident that we will eventually win this case and that cross will be removed, or atheists will be allowed to have our own symbol in there,"" he said. Memorial tourism bears witness to tragedy .","(505, 23)","In a recent court decision, a judge has thrown out a lawsuit brought by an atheist group challenging the inclusion of two intersecting steel beams in the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. The beams are considered iconic symbols of the World Trade Center's resilience and are on display at the museum.  The group, known as American Atheists, argued that the presence of the beams, which were recovered from the wreckage of the Twin Towers after the 9/11 attacks, amounted to a government endorsement of religion. They claimed that the beams, which resembled a cross, represented the Christian faith and violated the separation of church and state.  However, the judge ruled that the museum's display of the beams is permissible because they have historical significance and represent an important artifact from one of the most significant events in American history. The judge stated that the beams depict a moment of resilience and hope, rather than a religious symbol.  The president of American Atheists, David Silverman, expressed his disappointment in the ruling but highlighted that the case had a broader significance beyond the museum. He emphasized that the case was about equality and the need to ensure that all Americans, regardless of their religious beliefs, are treated equally.  ""9/11 affected all Americans, not just Christians,"" said Silverman. He added that the group plans to continue their efforts to ensure that the government remains neutral on issues of religion and that all Americans receive fair and equal treatment.  The inclusion of religious symbols in public places has been a controversial issue in the United States for many years. Many religious groups argue that such symbols are a part of the country's heritage and should be allowed in public spaces, while others argue that including such symbols violates the principle of separation of church and state.  In the past, the Supreme Court has held that the government cannot endorse or promote a particular religion. However, the inclusion of religious symbols in public spaces is often a matter of interpretation and has been the subject of intense debate in recent years.  Ultimately, the judge's decision to allow the display of the intersecting steel beams in the 9/11 museum represents a victory for those who believe that such symbols have historical significance and reflect important moments in American history. It also highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the role of religion in public life and the need to ensure that all Americans receive equal treatment under the law.","(454, 16)","New York (CNN) -- A New York judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed by
an atheist group challenging the inclusion of two intersecting steel
beams from the World Trade Center in the National September 11
Memorial and Museum.
U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken dismissed the lawsuit filed by the
American Atheists, which argued that the inclusion of the so-called
""Survivor Stairs"" in the museum violated the First Amendment's
separation of church and state.
Oetken wrote in his decision that the beams have ""historical
importance"" and that their inclusion in the museum does not violate
the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the
establishment of religion by the government.
""Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the
merits of their Establishment Clause claim,"" Oetken wrote. ""The
Survivor Stairs' inclusion in the Museum does not violate the
Establishment Clause because the Survivor Stairs have historical
importance, and the Museum's display of the Survivor Stairs is
permissible because it is secular in purpose and effect.""
The lawsuit was filed last year by David Silverman, president of the
New Jersey-based American Atheists, who said the inclusion of the
beams in the museum amounted to a government endorsement of religion.
Silverman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on
Oetken's ruling.
The beams, which are known as the ""Survivor Stairs,"" were discovered
in the rubble of the World Trade Center after the September 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks. They became a symbol of hope for rescue workers
because they were one of the few pieces of the building that remained
intact after the collapse of the twin towers.
The beams have been treated as an iconic symbol of the September 11
attacks and have been displayed in several locations, including the
National September 11 Memorial and Museum in New York City and the
National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial in Washington, D.C.
The lawsuit was filed against the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center site, and the National
September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center Foundation,
which operates the museum.
In his ruling, Oetken noted that the beams have been displayed in
several locations around the country, including the National 9/11
Pentagon Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National
Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
Oetken also noted that the beams had been displayed at the National
Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, before they
were moved to the World Trade Center memorial site in New York City.
""The fact that the Survivor Stairs were previously displayed at the
National Museum of the U.S. Air Force demonstrates that the Survivor
Stairs have historical importance and are not inherently religious,""
Oetken wrote.
The judge also noted that the museum's display of the beams is
secular in purpose and effect, and that the beams are not being
displayed in a religious context.
""The Survivor Stairs are not being displayed in a religious context;
rather, they are being displayed in a secular context as part of the
museum's exhibit on the events of September 11th, 2001,"" Oetken
wrote. ""The Survivor Stairs' display in the Museum is secular in
purpose and effect, and therefore does not violate the Establishment
Clause.""
Oetken also rejected the atheist group's argument that the inclusion
of the beams in the museum violates the principle of separation of
church and state.
""The Establishment Clause does not prohibit all government
endorsement of religion; rather, it prohibits the government from
endorsing a particular religion or religion in general over non-
religion,"" he wrote. ""Here, there is no evidence that the government
is endorsing Christianity or any other religion over non-religion by
displaying the Survivor Stairs in the Museum.""","(705, 20)",,

A dancer with a reputation as the 'bad boy' of ballet has blamed an unspecified 'health issue' for walking out on a production of Midnight Express days before opening night. Sergei Polunin, 23 - who hit the headlines when he unexpectedly quit the Royal Ballet last year - apologised for his shock exit from the show with Peter Schaufuss' company in April ahead of its London premiere. The Ukrainian star joked that he was 'pretty certain' he would make it to the stage for his new show, Coppelia at the Coliseum in the West End in July. Apology: Ukrainian ballet star Sergei Polunin said his shock exit from the production of Midnight Express was down to a 'health issue' Speaking at a press conference today, Polunin said: 'The only thing I can say is there was a health issue and I couldn’t say anything at that time.' He added: 'I apologise to the audience because I couldn’t even explain at that time.' Asked if he could explain now, he said: 'Not yet, maybe one day I will.' Polunin, who has performed in Russia since April, said: 'In Russia it’s great because you can concentrate 100 per cent on your work. There are not as many distractions as London or in the West.' Schaufuss said he was 'delighted' Polunin was coming back to the London stage and described him as a great dancer. 'Bad boy': The 23-year-old dancer is seen in action on stage in a Royal Ballet production of Sleeping Beauty in 2011 . Asked if the pair had made up, Polunin said he was not 'friends' with Schaufuss, but said they had a professional relationship. He said: 'I always respect Peter as a dancer and as a director, we’ve never made friends, but I still respect him. 'I think it’s important for professionals to do work even if you don’t become friends.' Asked about his reputation as the bad boy of ballet, Polunin said: 'It’s not being bad, it’s just trying to find yourself.'","(429, 21)","Sergei Polunin, the Ukrainian ballet dancer, has once again sparked controversy by walking out on rehearsals for a production ahead of its London premiere in April. The 23-year-old dancer, who has previously quit the famed Royal Ballet unexpectedly, apologised for his actions but refused to elaborate on the reasons that led to his departure. According to insiders, Polunin has cited unspecified ""health issues"" but did not offer any further details. Polunin, who was once touted as the future of ballet, has gained a reputation for his erratic behaviour and controversial statements. Last year, he announced his departure from the Royal Ballet in a shock move that made headlines around the world. In a subsequent interview, he spoke candidly about his disillusionment with the world of ballet and his desire to explore other forms of artistic expression. Despite his troubled past, Polunin remains a highly sought-after talent, commanding top fees for his performances. He has also received critical acclaim for his work in a number of productions, drawing praise for his technical skill and emotive performances. News of Polunin's departure from the upcoming production has caused consternation among fans and industry insiders alike, who are concerned about the impact of his absence on the show. In a statement, the production company acknowledged the disruption caused by Polunin's departure but expressed confidence in the remaining cast members to deliver a stellar performance. Despite the controversy surrounding Polunin, his talent and charisma have earned him a loyal following, with fans around the world eagerly anticipating his next move. While the reasons for his latest departure remain shrouded in mystery, there is no doubt that the enigmatic dancer will continue to captivate and confound audiences for years to come. In conclusion, Polunin's actions have caused concern and disappointment among his fans and the dance community at large. While his talent is undeniable, his tendency towards erratic behaviour has raised questions about his future in the industry. Only time will tell if Polunin will find his way back to the stage or if he will choose to pursue other forms of artistic expression.","(387, 15)","By. Kerry Mcdermott.

Sergei Polunin walks out on production ahead of London premiere
Ukrainian dance sensation Sergei Polunin has walked out on a new production just days before its London premiere.
The 23-year-old, who shot to fame when he unexpectedly quit the Royal Ballet last year, was due to star in a new production of Swan Lake at the London Coliseum next week.
But he has now pulled out of the show, citing a 'health issue', according to a statement from the English National Opera (ENO), which is staging the production.
Polunin said: 'It is with great regret that I have had to withdraw from the ENO's production of Swan Lake.
'I have been suffering from a health issue for the past few weeks and my doctor has advised me not to perform until I am fully recovered.
'I apologise to all those who have been looking forward to seeing me in this production. I look forward to returning to the stage as soon as possible.'
A spokesman for the ENO said: 'We are very disappointed that Sergei Polunin will not be able to perform in our production of Swan Lake next week.
'We wish him a speedy recovery and look forward to working with him again in the future.'
Polunin made headlines around the world when he walked out on the Royal Ballet in April 2012, just months after being promoted to principal dancer.
He later apologised for his actions, but refused to elaborate on the 'health issue' that forced him to pull out of Swan Lake.
Polunin was born in Ukraine in 1989 and trained at the Kyiv State Choreographic School.
He joined the Royal Ballet in 2002 and was promoted to first soloist in 2007 and principal dancer in 2010.
He left the company in 2012 to pursue a career as a freelance dancer and choreographer.
Polunin has worked with some of the world's leading ballet companies, including the Bolshoi Ballet, the Paris Opera Ballet and the New York City Ballet.
He has also appeared in a number of films and television programmes, including the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing and ITV's Dancing on Ice.
Polunin's decision to walk out on Swan Lake is a blow to the ENO, which has been struggling financially in recent years.
The company has been forced to cancel a number of productions in the past few years due to lack of funding.
Swan Lake is one of the most popular ballets in the world and has been performed by some of the greatest dancers of all time, including Rudolf Nureyev, Margot Fonteyn and Mikhail Baryshnikov.
The ENO's production, which was due to open on June 4, is directed by Wayne McGregor and choreographed by Liam Scarlett.
It features a cast of more than 100 dancers, including Polunin's former Royal Ballet colleague Alina Cojocaru.
Cojocaru said: 'I am very sorry to hear that Sergei will not be performing in Swan Lake.
'He is a wonderful dancer and I am sure he will be back on stage as soon as he is feeling better.'
Polunin's withdrawal from Swan Lake is the latest in a series of setbacks for the ENO.
Last year, the company was forced to cancel its production of Tosca due to a lack of funding.
And earlier this year, it was announced that the ENO would be merging with the Royal Opera House to create a new national opera company.
The merger, which is due to take place in 2015, is seen as a way of securing the future of both companies.
But it has also been criticised by some, who argue that it will lead to a reduction in the number of performances and a decrease in the quality of the productions.
The ENO has denied that the merger will have any impact on the quality of its productions.
A spokesman said: 'The ENO is committed to producing high-quality opera and ballet.
'We are confident that the merger will not affect the quality of our productions and we look forward to continuing to bring world-class opera and ballet to audiences across the UK.'","(772, 36)",,

Jose Mourinho is to contest his FA misconduct charge when he makes a formal submission
","Jose Mourinho is to contest his FA misconduct charge when he makes a formal submission to the governing body before Tuesday’s 6pm deadline. The Chelsea manager was charged after claiming there is a ‘campaign’ against the Barclays Premier League leaders when they were denied a penalty in the 1-1 draw at Southampton on December 28. Mourinho, who has generally toned down his comments since his return to English football, has the full support of the club in his case. Jose Mourinho was charged by the FA for saying that there was a campaign against Chelsea . Mourinho (right) talks to his support staff after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving against Southampton . The Chelsea manager can make representations to the FA disciplinary commission by way of mitigation, but it appears he is most likely to highlight his concerns by requesting a personal hearing. It is understood Mourinho will put together video evidence to support his claim that match officials are failing to award his team key decisions in matches. Mourinho lost control at St Mary’s when referee Anthony Taylor booked Cesc Fabregas for simulation when the Spaniard appeared to be fouled by Southampton defender Matt Targett. At the time he said: ‘There is a campaign against Chelsea. I don't know why there is this campaign and I do not care. Everybody knows it was a penalty.’ Cesc Fabregas is shocked after being denied a penalty and is instead booked for simulation . Fabregas appears to be brought down by Southampton's Matt Targett during the match at St Mary's . Since the charge he has taken a vow of silence and refused to speak with the media ahead of Saturday’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle United at Stamford Bridge. The Chelsea chief sent his assistant coach Steve Holland instead, and it was his deputy who again spoke to the media after the win over John Carver’s Magpies side. An FA statement released last week said: ‘It is alleged his remarks constitute improper conduct in that they allege and/or imply bias on the part of a referee or referees and/or bring the game into disrepute.’ Mourinho has already been issued with a formal warning following his demand for a ‘strong referee’ ahead of Chelsea's 2-0 win at Stoke City on December 22. Chelsea beat Newcastle United 2-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday but Mourinho did not face the media . Assistant manager Steve Holland stepped in for Mourinho at Chelsea's press conference on Friday .","(453, 17)","Last week, Jose Mourinho, the manager of Chelsea FC, was given a misconduct charge by the Football Association (FA). This comes after he claimed that there was a ""campaign"" being carried out against his team. Mourinho's charges stem from his post-match comments following Chelsea's 1-3 loss against Southampton on Saturday, October 3rd. During the game, Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas was shown a yellow card for simulation after he was brought down inside the penalty box. Mourinho claimed that it was a clear penalty and that his team was not getting the same calls that other Premier League teams were receiving. He further suggested that there was a ""campaign"" being carried out to tarnish Chelsea's reputation. The FA has charged Mourinho with misconduct under Rule E3(1) for his post-match comments. He was given until 6 pm on Tuesday, October 13th, to formally respond to the charges. It is expected that Mourinho will use video evidence to support his claims. This is not the first time that Mourinho has landed in trouble with the FA. In the 2014-15 season, he was charged with misconduct on two separate occasions, which led to him being banned from the touchline for the FA Cup quarter-final tie against Bradford City. Chelsea is currently enduring a difficult start to the 2015-16 season. The defending champions have won only two of their first eight Premier League matches, leaving them in 16th place in the table. There have been rumors of a rift between Mourinho and some of his players, which has resulted in some poor performances on the pitch. Chelsea fans will be hoping that the situation improves soon, as they look to defend their Premier League title. In the meantime, Mourinho will be focusing on preparing for Chelsea's upcoming matches, while also responding to the FA charges. This is a developing story, and we will bring you updates as they come in. Stay tuned to our website for more Chelsea news, including analysis of Mourinho's response to the charges, his team's performance on the pitch, and the ongoing rumors of a dressing room rift.","(398, 18)","Jose Mourinho is to contest his FA misconduct charge when he makes a formal submission
on Tuesday. The Chelsea manager has been accused of bringing the game into disrepute after
claiming that there is a ‘campaign’ against his team in the wake of their 2-1 defeat to
Southampton last weekend. Mourinho has until 18:00 GMT on Tuesday to respond to the
charge, which carries a maximum fine of £50,000. The Portuguese boss is expected to use
video evidence to back up his claims that referee Mike Dean failed to award his side a
penalty when Cesc Fàbregas went down under a challenge from Morgan Schneiderlin.
Mourinho’s comments were made during his post-match press conference after Chelsea’s
defeat at St Mary’s. He said: “I think there is a campaign against my team. I don’t know if
it’s because we won the league last season or because this season we are fighting for the
title again. But I think there is a big campaign against my team.” Mourinho also criticised
the performance of referee Mike Dean, claiming that he missed a clear penalty when
Fàbregas was brought down by Schneiderlin in the first half. The Spanish midfielder was
shown a yellow card for diving rather than being awarded a spot-kick. Mourinho said: “I
don’t want to talk about the referee because I don’t want to get into trouble. But I think it
was a clear penalty. It was a clear penalty and the referee didn’t give it.” Mourinho’s
comments have been met with criticism from some sections of the media, who have
accused him of trying to deflect attention away from his team’s poor performance against
Southampton. However, the Chelsea manager is confident that he will be able to prove his
case when he makes his formal submission to the FA on Tuesday. In a statement, the FA
said: “The FA can confirm that Jose Mourinho has been charged with a breach of FA Rule

","By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:42 AM on 13th July 2011 . An historic London house inhabited by squatters was completely trashed last night after violence erupted at a 'closing party' advertised on Facebook. Police were forced to step in this morning after hundreds of people descended on the squat in Brixton, south London, following a council announcement that inhabitants of the property would be evicted today. There were reports of muggings and vandalism at the party at Clifton Mansions, a block of 22 council-owned flats on Coldharbour Lane. A man dives at police this morning as they arrive to evict squatters in the building in Brixton, south London . Hundreds of revellers last night turned up to a party at Clifton Mansions on Coldharbour Lane, which was finally brought to a close at 9am this morning when police stepped in to evict residents . The flats once housed alternative musicians and artists, such as members of Irish punk-folk band The Pogues and Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller. The council notified residents of the building, which has been squatted for over a decade, of this morning's eviction several weeks ago, claiming they were cracking down on 'anti-social behaviour'. In anticipation of the eviction, residents held an 'eviction party', with more than 1,000 people signing up for the event on Facebook. Twitter user 'smileandsubvert' tweeted: 'Brixton's longest squats turned into teenage Facebook party, vandalism, theft and finally eviction this morning.' In other tweets he said: '2 Polish . guys who lived there got pinned down & had their bikes and laptops . stolen' and '2 guys pulled all the copper piping off the walls.' The council notified residents of the squat of this morning's eviction several weeks ago, claiming they were cracking down on 'anti-social behaviour' Council-owned block Clifton Mansions, which once housed members of Irish punk-folk band The Pogues and Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller, has now been vacated . Police also said they were notified of a robbery at the address at 3.50am. A 17-year-old boy from Beckenham had his mobile phone stolen by two suspects. 'BrixtonBuzz' tweeted party-goers who heard about the event via Facebook had 'trashed what should have been a celebration of an old Brixton squat'. The party was finally brought to a close at 9am this morning when police stepped in to evict residents. A police spokesman said: 'The pre-planned eviction of Clifton Mansions went ahead with minimal pockets of resistance and the premises have now been vacated and handed back over to the Local Authority. 'During this incident a police officer received an injury to his eye and has been taken to a south London hospital. A 35 year-old man had been arrested for assault on police.' The council now plans to sell off the property, and will be employing 'live-in guardians' to safeguard the property until a buyer is found.","(534, 24)","Residents of a building that once housed members of the legendary Irish band, The Pogues, were shaken up after a terrifying incident last night. One inhabitant reported being pinned down and mugged by thieves who ripped copper piping from the walls of the flats. The iconic building, located in the heart of Dublin, has long been a mecca for music fans and history buffs alike. Known as ""The Pogues' flat,"" the building was home to the band's lead singer, Shane MacGowan, and other members in the early days of their career. Despite the building's storied past, it seems that it has not been immune to the rising tide of crime that has swept through Dublin in recent years. Last night's incident, which saw thieves rip copper piping from the walls of the flats, was just the latest in a string of similar crimes that have plagued the area. According to eyewitnesses, the thieves were brazen and efficient, quickly making off with the valuable copper piping before anyone could stop them. The incident has left residents feeling vulnerable and anxious, with many calling for increased security measures to be put in place. For some, the incident was especially jarring, given the historical significance of the building. One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""It's just devastating to see something like this happen to a place that means so much to so many people. This was the home of The Pogues, for crying out loud. It's like a piece of history has been desecrated."" Others were more concerned about the safety of the residents themselves. One inhabitant, who was home at the time of the incident, described the terror of being pinned down and mugged by the thieves. ""I heard a noise outside and when I went to investigate, these guys just came at me out of nowhere. They held me down and took my wallet and phone. It was absolutely terrifying."" The incident has prompted calls for increased security measures in the building, with some suggesting that security cameras and alarm systems be installed to better protect residents. There is also a growing sense of concern about the wider issue of crime in Dublin, with many residents feeling that more needs to be done to address the problem. For now, residents of ""The Pogues' flat"" are left to pick up the pieces and try to move on from this traumatic event. But there is no denying that this incident has shaken the community and served as a reminder of the ongoing challenges facing Dublin as it continues to grapple with rising crime rates.","(494, 21)","By.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new generation of deep-sea submarines light enough to launch from
","LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new generation of deep-sea submarines light enough to launch from a yacht could open up the ocean's depths to amateur explorers. The planned ""Deep Flight II"" -- shown here in an artist's impression -- should be able to dive to 37,000 ft. The ""Deep Flight"" winged submersibles are experimental prototypes designed to dive to depths of up to 37,000 ft -- almost four times as deep as a giant squid dives -- descending at 400 ft/minute. They are the brainchild of submarine designer Graham Hawkes who is in the process of building commercial models that can reach those depths. Hawkes has been designing submarines since the 1960s, working initially with the British Special Forces and then for the oil industry. He now sells his designs to wealthy sailboat owners as the ultimate yacht accessory. ""If you have the money for a mega-yacht and you're just limited to the surface, then what a waste. That's my perspective,"" Hawkes told CNN in a telephone interview. The late billionaire balloonist and adventurer, Steve Fossett, commissioned one of Hawkes' experimental prototypes, ""Deep Flight Challenger,"" which can dive to 37,000 ft. The craft was four weeks away from delivery when he died. Venture capitalist Tom Perkins has ordered one of Hawkes' first commercially-available models, ""Deep Flight Superfalcon"" for his yacht ""Maltese Falcon."" The $1.5 million sub is capable of diving to 1,000 ft and comes complete with air conditioning. While price means these craft are out of reach for most leisure users, Hawkes denies they are simply rich men's toys. ""The thing is a space ship, I don't like the term toy,"" said Hawkes of the subs which his company is also positioning as a cheaper alternative to research craft for science, industry and exploration. ""'Superfalcon' has a capability greater than the U.S. Navy. ""I personally very much like the idea of empowering individuals to explore."" Unlike conventional subs which get heavy and sink, Hawkes' designs are positively buoyant and have to power down into the depths: ""It's like an airplane in reverse."" They have life support good for 24 hours in the depths and a range of 10-20 miles. They are also quick and highly maneuverable. Hawkes, who describes himself as claustrophobic, says diving deep in one of his subs is an ""awe inspiring experience."" ""We just finished flight testing 'Superfalcon. It goes down vertical and you pull one gee when you make a turn,"" he said. Paul Willis contributed to this report.","(492, 23)","A new deep-sea sub called the Deep Flight II has been designed to be able to dive to the depths of 37,000 feet. The brainchild of designer Graham Hawkes, the new sub is also light enough to be launched from a yacht, making it the perfect tool for those who want to explore the deepest parts of the sea. According to Hawkes, he is in the process of producing the first Deep Flight II craft, which has yet to be priced. However, the current sub that he has produced, called the Superfalcon, costs $1.5 million. While that might seem like a lot of money for a sub, Hawkes claims that the Superfalcon has a capability greater than that of the U.S. Navy. The Deep Flight II sub uses a revolutionary design that allows it to move through water with very little resistance. This is important when diving to such great depths, as the water pressure can be extreme. The sub is also equipped with advanced technology that allows it to function in such extreme conditions. It is able to withstand the intense pressure and still provide a comfortable environment for those inside. Launching the sub from a yacht is also an important feature. It makes it possible for anyone who can afford to own a yacht to be able to explore the depths of the sea. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for those who are interested in deep-sea exploration. While the Deep Flight II sub is still in the process of being produced, it has already generated a lot of interest among those who are interested in deep-sea exploration. The ability to dive to 37,000 feet is a feat that has never been achieved before, and the fact that the sub is light enough to be launched from a yacht is an added bonus. The sub is expected to be available for purchase in the near future, though no official release date has been announced. For those who are interested in owning one, it is likely to be quite expensive. However, for those who are serious about deep-sea exploration, the price will be worth it to be able to explore the depths of the sea like never before. In conclusion, the Deep Flight II sub is a game-changer for deep-sea exploration. With its ability to dive to 37,000 feet and its lightweight design that allows it to be launched from a yacht, it opens up a whole new world of possibilities for those who are interested in exploring the depths of the sea. While it might be expensive, it is likely to be worth it for those who are serious about deep-sea exploration.","(486, 20)","LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new generation of deep-sea submarines light enough to launch from
yachts is being developed by a British designer.
Graham Hawkes, who has been designing deep-sea submersibles for more than 30 years, is in the
process of producing the first of a new breed of submersibles that can dive to depths of 37,000
feet (11,300 meters).
Hawkes' company, Hawkes Ocean Technologies (HOT), has already produced the Superfalcon, a
submersible capable of diving to 20,000 feet (6,100 meters). The Superfalcon, which costs about
$1.5 million, is currently being used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) in the United States.
Hawkes told CNN that the Superfalcon had a capability greater than that of the United States
Navy's Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV), which can dive to a depth of 18,000 feet (5,500
meters).
The Superfalcon was launched in 2003 and has since been used by NOAA to explore shipwrecks off
the coasts of Florida and Hawaii.
Hawkes said he was now working on the Deep Flight II, which will be able to dive to depths of
37,000 feet. The Deep Flight II will be lighter than the Superfalcon and will be able to be
launched from a yacht.
The Deep Flight II is expected to be ready for launch in 2010.
Hawkes, who is based in San Francisco, California, said he was inspired to design deep-sea
submersibles after watching Jacques Cousteau's television program ""The Undersea World of
Jacques Cousteau"" as a child.
He said he had always been fascinated by the idea of exploring the deep sea and wanted to
develop a submersible that could take people to the deepest parts of the ocean.
Hawkes' submersibles have been used for a variety of purposes, including scientific research,
exploration, and film-making.
One of the most famous uses of a Hawkes submersible was in the 1997 film ""Titanic,"" where it was
used to film the wreck of the RMS Titanic on the ocean floor.
Hawkes has also designed submersibles for use in the oil and gas industry, where they are used
to inspect pipelines and other underwater infrastructure.
Hawkes believes that his submersibles have the potential to revolutionize the way we explore and
understand the deep sea.
He said that the Deep Flight II would be able to take people to places in the ocean that have
never been seen before, and that it would open up new opportunities for scientific research and
environmental monitoring.
Hawkes also believes that the submersibles could be used for tourism, allowing people to
experience the wonders of the deep sea without having to go through the rigors of traditional
deep-sea diving.
Hawkes Ocean Technologies is currently working on a number of other projects, including the
development of a new type of submersible that can fly underwater.
The company is also working on a project to develop a new type of propulsion system for
submersibles, which would allow them to travel faster and farther than ever before.
Hawkes is confident that his company will continue to innovate and push the boundaries of what is
possible in the world of deep-sea exploration.
He said that he was excited about the future of his company and the potential for his submersibles
to change the way we see and understand the deep sea.

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A judge has ordered the children of the Rev. Martin Luther
","ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- A judge has ordered the children of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to meet in their capacity as the sole shareholders of the corporation that manages their iconic father's estate. Dexter King has denied taking ""substantial funds"" from his parents' estates. King's children were in Fulton County, Georgia, Superior Court Monday in a dispute over their parents' estates. Two children of the civil rights icon are suing their brother, accusing him of wrongfully taking money from their parents' estates. The Rev. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III allege Dexter King took ""substantial funds"" out of Coretta Scott King's estate and ""wrongfully appropriated"" money from their father's estate. Dexter King has publicly denied the accusations. It was unclear what outcome having a shareholder meeting for the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr., Inc. would have on the dispute. The three siblings have not held such a meeting since 2004, corporation attorney Luke Lantta said. The removal of Dexter King as the estate's administrator is unlikely because that would require a meeting of the board of directors. Judge Ural Glanville on Monday also ruled in favor of dismissing some of the allegations against Dexter King, but left the question of whether he failed to act in the best interest of his father's incorporated estate to a jury. A trial on the allegation of breach of fiduciary duty could happen as early as next month. The lawsuit reveals a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity, particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King were in the courtroom Monday, but Dexter King was not. He had been injured in an accident in California and did not make the trip to Georgia. Dexter King had filed a counter claim against his sister, asking the court to force her to hand over to the corporation some items that belonged to Martin Luther King Jr. In a special hearing Monday, the court ruled that the items, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s Nobel Peace Prize and his love letters to Coretta Scott King will be turned over to the court to hold until a resolution is reached. The courtroom was packed with supporters of the King family. Among those in attendance were the Rev. Joseph Lowery and former Ambassador Andrew Young, friends of Martin Luther King Jr. who worked with him during the civil rights movement. CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","(471, 22)","Atlanta, Georgia - The King family is once again embroiled in a legal battle as two of Martin Luther King Jr.'s children, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III, have accused their brother, Dexter King, of taking money from the estates of their late parents. However, Dexter has strongly denied such claims. The dispute, which is playing out in a Georgia court, centers around the estates of Coretta Scott King and her husband, the world-renowned civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Dexter, who is the executor of the estates, has been accused of mismanaging funds and making unauthorized payments to himself. Bernice and Martin Luther King III have claimed that their brother has not been transparent about the details of his management of the estates. They allege that he has violated the trust agreements and fiduciary duties that were established to ensure that funds were properly managed and distributed according to their parents' wishes. The allegations have caused tension within the King family and even resulted in a courthouse showdown, with civil rights icons like Andrew Young and Jesse Jackson turning up in support of the sibling accusers. In contrast, Dexter King attended the legal hearing with his wife, Leah Weber King. The family dispute reportedly arose from a 2007 settlement agreement in which the siblings agreed to allow Dexter to serve as the executor of the estates, in exchange for a share of the profits earned from the estates. Mostly, they agreed to have their mother's archives preserved at Morehouse College. The current dispute, however, centers around what the siblings believe to be an abuse of that trust. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III are seeking to have their brother removed as executor and replaced with an independent trustee to ensure the estates are properly managed. Dexter King, however, strongly defended his actions, stating that his management of the estates has always been legal and above board. He claims that his siblings are simply trying to oust him for personal gain. ""Dexter believes that these claims are frivolous and are without merit,"" said William Hill Jr, Dexter's lawyer. The legal battle between the King siblings is ongoing, and the case is expected to drag on for some time. Meanwhile, the civil rights icons who have rallied around the family have called for a peaceful resolution to the dispute so that the King legacy can continue to inspire future generations.","(449, 16)","ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A judge has ordered the children of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. to appear in court next month to settle a dispute over the late civil rights
leader's estate.
Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney issued the order Tuesday after hearing arguments
from attorneys for Dexter Scott King and Martin Luther King III, who have accused their
sister, Bernice King, of misappropriating funds from their father's estate.
McBurney said he will hold a hearing on the matter on November 18.
Bernice King, who is the chief executive officer of the King Center for Nonviolent
Social Change, has denied the allegations.
The dispute centers on the sale of a house in Atlanta that was once owned by Martin
Luther King Jr. and his wife, Coretta Scott King, who died in 2006.
The house was sold in 2006 for $1.4 million, and the proceeds were placed in a trust
for the benefit of the couple's four children, according to court documents.
Dexter King, who is chairman of the board of the King Center, and Martin Luther King
III, who is president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, have accused
Bernice King of misappropriating some of the proceeds from the sale of the house.
They have also accused her of mismanaging the King Center, which was founded by their
parents in 1968.
Bernice King has denied the allegations and has accused her brothers of trying to
undermine her leadership of the King Center.
She has also accused them of trying to gain control of the King Center's assets.
The dispute has been ongoing for several years and has been the subject of numerous
court battles.
In 2017, a judge ruled that Bernice King had the authority to sell the house and that
the proceeds from the sale should be placed in a trust for the benefit of the King
children.
However, Dexter King and Martin Luther Kings III appealed the ruling, arguing that
Bernice King did not have the authority to make the sale without their consent.
In 2019, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling, finding that
Bernice king had the authority to act on behalf of the King children.
However, the court also found that the King children had the right to challenge the
sale of the house if they believed it was not in their best interests.
The dispute between the King children has raised questions about the future of the
King Center and the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.
Some critics have accused the King children of squabbling over their father's estate,
while others have defended them, saying they are simply trying to protect their
father's legacy.
Whatever the outcome of the dispute, it is clear that the King children will continue
to be involved in the management of the King Center and the promotion of their
father's message of nonviolence and social justice.","(536, 19)",,

By . Daniel Mills . The family of a Queensland woman who died during her
","By . Daniel Mills . The family of a Queensland woman who died during her work Christmas party will not receive a payout for her death because she was ruled to be off-duty when the accident happened. Jukes Campbell was celebrating the function with colleagues when she dove into a shallow section of the Noosa River, suffering neck and back injuries. Despite the party being sanctioned by her boss and organised by the Woolworths-owned store, her death won't be recognised as a workplace accident. Jonathon Campbell, the woman's husband, turned her life support off two days after the party. Jonathon Campbell lost his a bid for his wife's workers compensation after the Queensland IRC ruled she did not die from duties performed at work. The Courier Mail reported that the Industrial Relations Commission, who sided with a Woolworths bid to block the family's claim for compensation, ruled that her husband Mr Campbell was not entitled to a payout from his wife’s death because she had been 'on a frolic of her own'. In order to qualify for a workers compensation payout staff must prove their injury 'arose out of, or in the course of' their work. The IRC ruled that Mrs Campbell was not working, proving a cruel blow for her husband who had originally won a Queensland Government workers compensation claim after the deputy director-general for Fair and Safe Work Queensland approved it. Woolworths said its staff encouraged Ms Campbell to attend the party which was celebrated in March instead of December because of staff commitments, but denied they encouraged her to dive into the Noosa River. It is claimed Ms Campbell asked her manager to take photos of her just before the accident occurred. Mrs Campbell dove head first into the Noosa River, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast during a Christmas work party in March . The Noosaville Dan Murphy's Store where Mrs Campbell worked . Woolworths has refused to comment on the matter because Mr Campbell has lodged an appeal and the case is still ongoing. The maximum amount payable for a workers compensation payout in Queensland is $374,625. Woolworths is one of Australia's largest retailers employing more than 197,000 people nationwide. It has nearly 900 retail liquor outlets and 627 petrol stations. In a similar case in NSW, Woolworths refused to pay workers compensation to the three orphaned children of single mother Marie Scanlan, the manager of a petrol station in western Sydney. Ms Scanlan suffered a  heart attack while driving to a stressful management meeting in April four years ago. The Workers Compensation Commission ordered Woolworths to pay $433,650 to Ms Scanlan’s children because her stressful job, where she worked up to 70 hours a week, aggravated her deadly heart condition.","(501, 21)","A Sunshine Coast mother has tragically passed away after an incident at a Christmas party organized by her employer, Woolworths. Jukes Campbell dived into a shallow section of the Noosa River, which resulted in severe injuries to her neck and back. Despite being taken to the hospital, she succumbed to her injuries. The incident has since taken a turn in the legal system as her husband, Jonathon Campbell, filed for workplace compensation from Woolworths. Initially approved, the appeal process overturned the decision after the Industrial Relations Commission found that Woolworths was not responsible for her injuries. The reason given was that the accident occurred while Jukes was off duty. Mr. Campbell has appealed this decision and is seeking justice for his late wife, but Woolworths has refused to comment on the matter. The death of Jukes Campbell has left her family and loved ones devastated. A community member, who wished to remain anonymous, spoke to local reporters and expressed their sadness over the situation. ""Jukes was such a kind-hearted woman. It's so unfair that she was taken away from us so soon. My heart goes out to her family, especially her husband, in this difficult time,"" they said. The incident has also sparked a conversation about employee safety, both on and off-duty. Many people are questioning whether employers should be held responsible for incidents that occur outside of work but during work-related events. According to the Queensland Work Health and Safety Act 2011, it is an employer's responsibility to ensure the safety of their employees in the workplace. However, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a workplace outside of work hours or off-site events. As the legal proceedings continue, many people are eagerly waiting to see what the outcome will be. Regardless of the final decision, the tragedy of Jukes Campbell's death is a reminder that safety should always be a top priority in the workplace and beyond. In conclusion, the death of Jukes Campbell at a Christmas party organized by her employer, Woolworths, has left her family and community devastated. Her husband's appeal for workplace compensation was overturned on the grounds that the accident occurred while Jukes was off duty. As the legal battle continues, this incident has sparked a conversation about employee safety beyond the borders of the workplace. Regardless of the outcome, it serves as a reminder to always prioritize safety and ensure the well-being of employees both on and off the clock.","(458, 22)","By. Daniel Mills. The family of a Queensland woman who died during her
work Christmas party has lost an appeal against a decision that her
employer was not responsible for her death.
Jukes Campbell, 34, was at a Christmas function organised by her
employer, Woolworths, when she dived head-first into a shallow section
of the Noosa River on the Sunshine Coast in December 2010.
She suffered neck and back injuries and died in hospital two days later.
Her husband, Jonathon Campbell, took legal action against Woolworths,
claiming his wife's death was caused by the supermarket chain's
negligence.
But the Industrial Relations Commission found the company was not
responsible for Ms Campbell's injuries because the accident had
happened while she was off-duty.
Mr Campbell appealed the decision, but the Queensland Court of Appeal
upheld the commission's ruling on Friday.
Woolworths is not commenting on the case.
Mr Campbell said he was ""disappointed"" with the court's decision, but
said he would continue to fight for justice for his wife.
""It's been a long and difficult journey for our family, but we will
continue to do everything we can to ensure that Jukes' death is not
in vain,"" he said in a statement.
""We hope that this case will serve as a reminder to all employers that
they have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their employees,
regardless of whether they are on or off duty.""
Ms Campbell's death was a tragic reminder of the dangers of diving into
shallow water, which can result in serious injuries or even death.
It is important for people to be aware of the risks associated with
diving into shallow water, and to take precautions to ensure their
safety.
For example, people should always check the depth of the water before
diving in, and should avoid diving into water that is too shallow or
too deep.
They should also wear appropriate safety gear, such as a life jacket,
and should only dive into water that is clear and free of debris.
By taking these precautions, people can help to reduce the risk of
injury or death from diving into shallow water.","(405, 17)",,

The Oakland Police Department said Tuesday in an e-mail that the Alameda County coroner's office has identified the remains of a woman found Friday in Solano County, which is between Sacramento and San Francisco, as those of Sandra Coke. Coke, who worked as an investigator in the Federal Public Defender's Office in Sacramento, was reported missing by her family on August 4. ""She was a loving mother, daughter, sister and auntie, and a shining light in our family; her good cheer, easy laugh and generous hugs will be missed,"" her family said Tuesday in a statement. ""Those of us who were privileged to know Sandra will remember her as an unusually kind, generous and big-hearted person."" Reports on a Facebook site tied to the family noted that Coke had gone to an Oakland drugstore intending to meet someone she thought had information about her missing dog. Her 15-year-old daughter called Coke's longtime friend, Wendy Springer, hours later when her mother hadn't returned home. Her car -- a 2007 Mini Cooper convertible -- was found in a parking lot the next day. ""She would never have left her daughter for more than 15 minutes and not checked in,"" Springer told reporters Thursday. That day, family members announced a $100,000 reward for information that would lead to Coke. They also spearheaded efforts to canvass the northern California city that she called home. According to Oakland police, Coke had been in good mental and physical health with no history of being reported missing. News of her death spurred an outpouring of condolences, including from Democratic campaign strategist Christine Pelosi and Natasha Minsker, a local ACLU leader who tweeted that Coke ""will be missed by many."" The grief was palpable in the statement from Coke's family, who hailed her impact professionally and personally on many people. ""She passionately devoted her professional life to helping the poor and those who endured difficult childhoods,"" the family said. ""All of us will miss Sandra's beautiful, giving spirit.""

The community rallied around the family, posting flyers and sharing information on social media. However, the search efforts were unsuccessful for several months until last week when Solano County authorities discovered her remains. The Coke family released a statement expressing their grief and sadness over the loss of Sandra. They described her as ""a shining light in our family,"" and remembered her as a kind, loving, and caring person who always put her family and friends first. The Oakland Police Department is investigating the case as a homicide and has identified a suspect in the case. Randy Alana, a convicted felon, has been arrested and charged with Coke's murder. According to police, Alana had a history of criminal activity, including robbery and assault. Alana and Coke reportedly met sometime in 2012 or 2013 after Alana's release from prison, where he had served a sentence for a previous conviction. Coke worked as an investigator for the Office of the Federal Public Defender and had been providing assistance to Alana in his legal case. The motive for Coke's murder is not yet clear, but investigators believe that Alana was the last person to see her alive. They have also found evidence linking Alana to the disposal of Coke's body.

Crews have found at least 20 people who were buried alive Thursday after pounding rains sent mud rushing over at least five homes in San Antonio de Escazu, a suburb of the nation's capital, the Costa Rica National Commission for Emergencies said.

Another 2,639 people have sought refuge in 46 shelters, the commission said. President Laura Chinchilla has declared a state of emergency and said that Friday and Saturday would be national days of mourning. She visited an affected area in San Antonio de Escazu Friday to offer her support to the families missing loved ones. Images airing on CNN affiliate Teletica showed rescue crews digging through demolished homes. In another scene, workers at a mud-covered overturned vehicle spread a white sheet over a victim's body. Other images showed buckled roads damaged by the ferocity of the rushing water. In another area, some residents strung up a rope between two banks so people could hold on to it and walk across rushing water. Mud slides and flooding were reported in many places in the Central Valley area, which is surrounded by a handful of mountains and volcanoes. It is the most populous part of the nation. Classes were indefinitely canceled at many of Costa Rica's public schools, the education minister said on Teletica. About 800,000 people were left without safe water supplies, and residents were told to boil any water to be used for drinking or cooking.","(332, 14)","In the aftermath of the heavy rainfall and flooding that has been affecting San Marcos de Tarrazu, three more people were found dead on Wednesday. This brings the total number of fatalities to six, with several others still missing. The flooding has also heavily impacted the infrastructure in the region. Numerous homes have been demolished, and roads have been washed away, making transportation difficult. As a result, the government has set up 46 shelters across the region, which have provided refuge for thousands of affected citizens. The government has called for a state of emergency in the region and has deployed emergency personnel to provide aid and assistance to those affected. Rescue operations are ongoing, with search parties combing the flooded areas for survivors and those still missing. The flooding in San Marcos de Tarrazu is a result of heavy rainfall that caused rivers to overflow and lead to flash floods, landslides, and mudslides. The flooding has also led to extensive damage to some of the crops in the region, which might lead to food shortages in the coming days. Authorities are urging the citizens of San Marcos de Tarrazu to follow safety protocols and stay in shelters or safe locations until the situation improves. The government has also set up a hotline for citizens to report any incidents or request assistance. This is not the first time that San Marcos de Tarrazu has experienced flooding. In 2018, floods and landslides caused by heavy rainfall also led to numerous deaths and significant property damage. The government is now working to clean up the affected regions and restore essential services, including road networks and utilities. Citizens are urged to stay vigilant and keep themselves and their families safe as the region recovers from this natural disaster.","(322, 15)","(CNN) -- Officials in Costa Rica worked Friday to mop up the damage after heavy
rains caused flooding and landslides that killed at least 10 people and forced
thousands to flee their homes.
The death toll rose to 10 after three more bodies were found in San Marcos de
Tarrazu, the National Emergency Commission (CNE) said. The victims included two
men and a woman, according to the CNE.
More than 3,000 people took refuge in 46 emergency shelters across the country,
the CNE said.
Homes were demolished and roads washed away in places, the CNE said.
President Luis Guillermo Solis declared a state of emergency in the provinces
of San Jose, Cartago, Alajuela, Heredia, Puntarenas, Limon, Guanacaste and
Perez Zeledon.
The declaration allows the government to mobilize all available resources to
respond to the disaster.
Solis said he would travel to the affected areas on Saturday.
Costa Rica's National Meteorological Institute (IMN) issued a red alert for the
entire country due to the heavy rains, which are expected to continue through
the weekend.
The IMN warned of possible landslides and flooding in low-lying areas, as well
as the possibility of rivers overflowing their banks.
The rainy season in Costa Rica typically runs from May to November, with the
heaviest rains occurring in September and October.
However, this year's rainy season has been particularly intense, with some
parts of the country receiving more than 200% of their normal rainfall.
The heavy rains have caused significant damage to infrastructure, including
roads, bridges, and power lines.
In addition, the rains have led to an increase in the number of landslides and
flooding incidents.
The Costa Rican government has been working to mitigate the impact of the heavy
rains, including by deploying emergency response teams and providing
assistance to affected communities.
However, the scale of the damage has been significant, and it is likely to take
some time for the country to recover fully from the effects of the heavy rains.

This is a good start, but there are a few things you can do to improve it.
First, try to use more specific language. For example, instead of saying ""heavy
rains,"" you could say ""torrential downpours."" This will make your writing more
vivid and engaging.
Second, try to vary your sentence structure. Right now, your sentences are all
very similar in length and structure. This can make your writing feel monotonous
and boring. Try to mix up your sentence lengths and structures to keep your
reader engaged.
Finally, try to incorporate some of the key highlights from the prompt into your
writing. For example, you could mention that the heavy rains have caused
significant damage to infrastructure, or that the government is working to
mitigate the impact of the rains.
If you can incorporate these suggestions into your writing, you'll be well on
your way to writing a great news article!","(560, 27)",,

(CNN) -- Ahead of the 31st anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
","(CNN) -- Ahead of the 31st anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said his country will show its support to the revolution on February 11. ""Our revolution has changed the patterns and the equations of the world,"" he said in a nationally televised interview. Ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the Ten Days of Dawn, which lead up to the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. He said that enemies who plotted against Iran during the election protests last year continue to plot, but despite all the economic sanctions on the country, they are not succeeding. ""This year, they have mobilized themselves again to harm the Iranian nation and to stop them, but they failed,"" he said, adding that the capitalist powers who are against Iran have peaked. Specifically, he cited the United States and United Kingdom as nations that have tried to interfere with Iran's domestic issues. ""They adopted their stances, and they failed,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""This is a clear defeat for them."" On the nuclear issue, Ahmadinejad said that Iran seeks such production for peaceful purposes only. The United States and other nations have expressed concern that Iran wants to acquire nuclear weapons. The same countries who doubt Iran could, instead, partner with Iran and build the nuclear plants themselves if they wanted, he said. ""Russia, France and the United States can come and sign contracts to build the power plants. It serves our interests as well as theirs. Of course, if they don't come to do this, we will reach a point [where we will] build our own power plant,"" he said. The Iranian leader also mentioned the three American hikers who have been detained, saying that negotiations are ongoing. ""We don't like anyone in jail or in prison, but these people have violated our borders, and it has a defined penalty,"" he said, adding that there are Iranians ""languishing within American jails."" He hinted at a possible prisoner swap. ""We are approaching this from a humanitarian perspective and see how it goes,"" Ahmadinejad said. U.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said the United States is prepared to answer any questions about Iranians in U.S. custody. ""It's hard to know what he meant from these fragmentary comments, but we have made clear that we want consular access to our citizens in Iranian custody,"" Duguid said. ""If President Ahmadinejad's comments suggest that they are prepared to grant us access through the Swiss and resolve the cases of the three hikers and others in custody, we would welcome that step. It is long overdue."" CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","(516, 23)","As Iran prepares to mark the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution on February 11, tensions with the United States and United Kingdom are on the rise. In a nationally televised interview on Tuesday, Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad accused the two countries of trying to interfere in Iran's affairs. Ahmadinejad's comments came amid ongoing negotiations for the release of three American hikers who have been detained in Iran since July 31. The hikers, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal, and Sarah Shourd, were arrested for allegedly crossing into Iran illegally while hiking in a mountainous area near the Iraqi border. Despite repeated appeals from the United States for their release, the Iranian government has refused to free the hikers, citing ongoing investigations into their case. Ahmadinejad, however, suggested in his interview that the hikers could be released soon. ""We have ongoing negotiations, and I think these issues will be resolved,"" he said. The Iranian leader also accused the United States and United Kingdom of trying to meddle in Iran's affairs. ""They want to interfere in the affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, but they will not be able to achieve their goals,"" he said. Ahmadinejad's remarks were likely aimed at the United States and United Kingdom's recent efforts to apply pressure on the Iranian government. Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions against Iran's ballistic missile program, while the U.K. froze the assets of an Iranian bank accused of funding terrorism. The tension between the two sides is unlikely to abate anytime soon, with both the U.S. and U.K. continuing to take a hardline stance on Iran. In a recent speech, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Iran that it would face ""consequences"" if it failed to meet its international obligations, while British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the U.K. would not hesitate to take action against the Iranian government if necessary. Despite the tough talk from both sides, there is hope that the upcoming anniversary of the Islamic Revolution could provide an opportunity for a diplomatic breakthrough. Known as the Ten Days of Dawn, the lead-up to February 11 is typically marked by rallies and celebrations across Iran, and could provide a platform for both sides to engage in dialogue and ease tensions. For now, the fate of the imprisoned American hikers remains uncertain. While Ahmadinejad's comments suggest that negotiations for their release are ongoing, it is unclear when or if they will be freed. As the U.S. and Iran continue to clash over a wide range of issues, it remains to be seen whether a resolution can be found.","(489, 18)","(CNN) -- Ahead of the 31st anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
said in a nationally televised interview that the United States and the United Kingdom are trying to interfere in his country's affairs.
Ahmadinejad also said that negotiations for the release of three American hikers, who have been detained in Iran since July 31, are continuing.
The Ten Days of Dawn, which lead up to the anniversary of the February 11, 1979, Islamic Revolution, are a time of national celebration in Iran.
During the interview, Ahmadinejad said the United States and Britain are trying to ""interfere in the internal affairs of Iran.""
He added that the two countries are trying to ""create problems"" for Iran, but that they will not succeed.
Iranian officials have accused the United States and other Western countries of interfering in the country's internal affairs.
The United States and its allies have imposed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, which they suspect is aimed at developing nuclear weapons.
Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, such as generating electricity.
The three American hikers -- Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal -- were detained in July while hiking near the Iraq-Iran border.
They were charged with espionage and face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
Their families say they are innocent and are being held as pawns in a political dispute between the United States and Iran.
In a statement released Monday, the families said they are ""deeply concerned"" about the health of the three hikers.
They said the hikers have not been allowed to see a doctor and have not received adequate medical care.
The families also said they are worried about the hikers' mental health, as they have not been able to communicate with their families for more than six months.
""We are deeply concerned about the physical and mental health of our loved ones,"" the families said in the statement.
""We urge the Iranian government to release them immediately and allow them to return home to their families.""
Ahmadinejad said in the interview that negotiations for the hikers' release are continuing, but he did not provide any details.
He also said that Iran is willing to negotiate with the United States on a range of issues, including its nuclear program.
However, he said that Iran will not compromise on its right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
The United States has said it is willing to talk to Iran about its nuclear program, but only if Iran agrees to suspend its uranium enrichment activities.

The World Health Organization wants you to stop eating so much sugar. Seriously. In draft
","The World Health Organization wants you to stop eating so much sugar. Seriously. In draft guidelines proposed this week, WHO is encouraging people to consume less than 5% of their total daily calories from sugars. The organization's current guidelines, published in 2002, recommend eating less than 10% of your total daily calories from sugars. Most Americans still consume much more. Our sweet tooth increased 39% between 1950 and 2000, according to the USDA. The average American now consumes about three pounds of sugar each week. ""There is increasing concern that consumption of free sugars, particularly in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages, may result in ... an increase in total caloric intake, leading to an unhealthy diet, weight gain and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases,"" WHO said in a statement. Of particular concern, WHO said, is the role sugar plays in causing dental diseases worldwide. For an adult at a normal body mass index, or BMI, eating 5% would be around 25 grams of sugar -- or six teaspoons. That's less than is typically found in a single can of regular soda, which contains about 40 grams of sugar. Real or fake sugar: Does it matter? To find the amount of calories from sugar in a product, multiply the grams by 4. For example, a product containing 15 grams of sugar has 60 calories from sugar per serving, according to the American Heart Association. If you eat 2,000 calories a day, that's 3%. WHO's proposed guidelines apply to sugars added to foods by manufacturers, as well as those found naturally in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit concentrates. They do not apply to those found in fresh produce. ""Much of the sugars consumed today are 'hidden' in processed foods that are not usually seen as sweets,"" the WHO website states. Did you know sugar is often added to your frozen pizza? How about your bread, soup, yogurt and mayonnaise? As consumers became more concerned about the amount of fat in their food, manufacturers went out of their way to make low-fat items -- often substituting sugar to preserve the taste. Choosing foods with fewer added sugars at the grocery story may soon get a little easier. The Food and Drug Administration has proposed several changes to the nutrition labels you see on packaged foods and beverages. The proposed labels would also note how much added sugar is in a product. Right now, it's hard to know what is naturally occurring sugar and what has been added by the manufacturer. The WHO guidelines will be open for public comment until March 31. Then WHO will finalize and publish its recommendations.","(507, 27)","The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued new guidelines that suggest people should consume less than 5% of their total daily calorie intake from sugars. This recommendation comes as concerns about the impact of sugar on health continue to grow. For an adult with a normal body mass index (BMI), consuming 5% of their daily calories in the form of sugar would equate to around 25 grams per day. This is equivalent to around six teaspoons of sugar. Excessive sugar intake has been linked to a wide range of health problems, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. However, one of the biggest concerns for the WHO is the role that sugar plays in causing dental diseases. According to the WHO, dental diseases affect around 3.5 billion people worldwide. These conditions range from cavities to gum disease and can cause significant pain and discomfort. In severe cases, dental diseases can even lead to tooth loss, which can have a negative impact on a person's overall health and wellbeing. One of the primary causes of dental disease is the bacteria that inhabit the oral cavity. These bacteria feed on sugar, which provides them with the energy they need to survive and reproduce. The more sugar a person consumes, the more fuel these bacteria have, which can lead to an overgrowth and subsequent dental problems. Understanding the impact of sugar on dental health is important, but it is also critical to recognize that consuming too much sugar can have negative effects throughout the body. When people consume large amounts of sugar, their bodies are forced to produce high levels of insulin to deal with the glucose that is released into the bloodstream. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance, which in turn increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Given all of these concerns, the WHO's new guidelines are welcome news. However, it is important to note that cutting back on sugar can be challenging, especially given its pervasive presence in many processed foods and drinks. To help avoid excessive sugar intake, people should focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible and limit their intake of sugary treats and drinks. Ultimately, the WHO's new guidelines are an important reminder of the need to pay attention to our sugar intake, not just for our dental health, but for our overall wellbeing. By making conscious choices about what we eat and drink, we can help reduce our risk of developing a wide range of health problems, from tooth decay to cardiovascular disease.","(478, 20)","The World Health Organization wants you to stop eating so much sugar. Seriously. In draft
guidelines released this week, the United Nations health agency said people should limit their
sugar intake to less than 5 percent of their total daily calories. That’s about 25 grams, or six
teaspoons, of sugar per day for adults with a normal body mass index (BMI), which is a measure
of body fat based on height and weight.
That’s a lot less than the average American consumes, which is about 22 teaspoons of added
sugar per day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And it’s even less
than what the American Heart Association recommends, which is no more than 6 teaspoons of
added sugar per day for women and 9 teaspoons for men.
So why is the WHO being so strict? Because sugar is bad for your health. It’s linked to obesity,
type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions. And it’s not just the amount of
sugar you eat that matters; it’s also the type of sugar. Refined sugars, like those found in candy
and soda, are particularly harmful because they’re quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and
cause a spike in blood sugar levels. This can lead to insulin resistance, which is a precursor to
type 2 diabetes.
The WHO’s new guidelines are part of a larger effort to reduce the global burden of non-
communicable diseases (NCDs), which are chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, cancer,
and diabetes. These diseases are responsible for more than 70 percent of all deaths worldwide,
and they’re on the rise. In fact, NCDs are now the leading cause of death in low- and middle-
income countries.
So what can you do to reduce your sugar intake? The first step is to be aware of how much
sugar you’re eating. Start by reading food labels and looking for hidden sources of sugar, like
high-fructose corn syrup. Then, make an effort to cut back on sugary foods and drinks, like
candy, soda, and fruit juice. Instead, choose healthier options like fruits, vegetables, whole
grains, and low-fat dairy products.
You can also try to limit your intake of refined carbohydrates, like white bread and pasta. These
foods are quickly broken down into sugar in the body, which can lead to spikes in blood sugar
levels. Instead, choose complex carbohydrates, like whole wheat bread and brown rice, which
are digested more slowly and don’t cause as much of a blood sugar spike.
Finally, make sure you’re getting enough physical activity. Exercise helps to regulate blood
sugar levels and can help to prevent weight gain. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-
intensity exercise, like brisk walking, most days of the week.
By following these tips, you can help to reduce your risk of developing NCDs and improve your
overall health. So next time you reach for a sugary snack, think twice. Your body will thank you
for it.","(588, 29)",,

Alan Pardew believes Newcastle United now have the attacking options to frighten the Premier League's top four – while new signing Remy Cabella insists the club can end their 46-year wait for a trophy. The Magpies have brought in seven new players for this season and Pardew, having survived a torrid end to the previous campaign, is in optimistic mood. His side struggled for goals and failed to score in 12 league games from January onwards as fans called for the manager to be sacked. Raring to go: Remy Cabella (left) is confident Newcastle can end their 46-year wait for a trophy . Happy days: Alan Pardew (right) believes his attacking players can rival any in the league's top four . But owner Mike Ashley has backed his boss this summer and France international Cabella has been joined at St James' Park by Siem de Jong, Emmanuel Riviere, Facundo Ferreyra, Jack Colback, Daryl Janmaat and Ayoze Perez. United finished 10th last time around but Pardew is now far happier with his offensive personnel and has hailed their activity in the transfer market. 'I think we have done some terrific business this summer. It must please the Newcastle fans that we have signed some exciting, offensive players,' he said. 'And, for me, I feel far more comfortable with the team and that we can play a brand of football that is expected of us. New boy: Emmanuel Riviere (right) also showed promise during Newcastle's trip to Germany . Winning feeling: Rolando Aarons (left) also shone in pre-season and scored against Schalke last weekend . 'It is very difficult for the likes of the teams outside of the Champions League money to compete. But we are trying to do it in an educated manner. 'We've been accused of not spending the money we bring in, but now we have spent it and we can hope to get as close as we can. Certainly, offensively we are definitely stronger. There is no doubt about that.' Cabellea – a £12m arrival from Montpellier – scored his first goal during Sunday's 3-1 win over Schalke in Germany. And he is already eyeing the silverware which would signal the club's first since 1969. 'I hope we can win a cup this season. We play for that to win a trophy,' he said. 'There is a good feeling in the team at the moment and my adaptation is good. I have friends who are French and I am very happy to be here. I am just waiting for the first game now.'","(493, 27)","Newcastle United have made significant strides in improving their squad ahead of the new Premier League season with the addition of seven new players. Manager Alan Pardew is optimistic about his side's chances in the upcoming campaign, while summer signing Remy Cabella has set his sights on winning a trophy. The Magpies recruited Cabella from French outfit Montpellier, along with the likes of Siem de Jong, Jack Colback and Daryl Janmaat, as well as Emmanuel Riviere, Ayoze Perez and Facundo Ferreyra on loan. The club also managed to hold onto key players such as Moussa Sissoko and Tim Krul, giving the team a much-needed boost in quality. Speaking ahead of the season opener against Manchester City, Pardew stated that the Newcastle fans could expect an exciting campaign. He was pleased with the club's transfer business and believed that the new players would add depth and quality to the squad. The Magpies have struggled in recent seasons, finishing 10th in the Premier League in the 2013/14 campaign, and Pardew is keen to improve on that position. The addition of Cabella, in particular, has given the manager confidence that he has the tools to succeed. The Frenchman impressed during the World Cup and his creativity and vision will be crucial to Newcastle's success. Cabella, for his part, has set his sights high. The attacking midfielder believes that the Magpies can win a trophy this season if they work hard and remain focused. He has been impressed by the quality of his new teammates and believes that the club has the potential to challenge for silverware. The 24-year-old has also spoken of his excitement at playing in the Premier League and is relishing the challenge. He is confident that he can make a big impact at Newcastle and help the team achieve their goals. Newcastle have made a promising start to the season, winning their opening game against Southampton 2-1 with goals from Papiss Cisse and Sissoko. The Magpies put in a solid defensive display and showed plenty of attacking intent, much to the delight of their fans. Pardew has praised his new signings following the victory and believes that they will only get better as they adapt to the Premier League. He is hoping that the team can build on their early momentum and make a real statement in the league this season. It remains to be seen whether Newcastle can meet Cabella's lofty ambitions and win a trophy this year.

the strength in depth to mount a serious challenge for a top-six finish this season.
The Magpies have invested heavily in their squad this summer, bringing in seven new
signings, and Pardew is confident his side can compete with the likes of Manchester
United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool.
He said: “I think we’ve got a good chance of finishing in the top six. I think we’ve
got a good chance of winning a trophy as well.
“We’ve got a lot of competition for places, which is a good thing. We’ve got players
who can come off the bench and make a difference.”
Pardew is particularly excited by the arrival of French midfielder Remy Cabella,
who joined from Montpellier for £8million earlier this summer.
The 24-year-old has already made an impressive start to life at St James’ Park,
scoring twice in three pre-season friendlies.
Pardew said: “Cabella is a fantastic signing for us. He’s going to be a big player for
Newcastle. He’s got everything you want in a footballer. He’s got pace, he’s got
technique, he’s got vision, he’s got a great left foot and he’s got a goal in him.
“I think he’s going to be one of the stars of the Premier League this season.”
Newcastle begin their Premier League campaign at home to Manchester City on August
23. They will then face West Ham United, Crystal Palace, Hull City and Burnley in
their first five league games.
Pardew is hoping his side can build on last season’s seventh-placed finish, which
was their highest since 2003-04.
He added: “We’re looking forward to the new season. We’ve had a good pre-season and
we’re in good shape. We’ve got a good group of players and we’re all looking forward

(CNN) -- Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman
","(CNN) -- Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman in the prison where he is serving a 28-year sentence, his attorney told HLN, CNN's sister network, on Friday. Van der Sloot, who remains the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of American Natalee Holloway, and his unnamed fiancÃ©e are working on completing the paperwork required for the wedding, said attorney Maximo Altez. The couple hopes to be able to marry within the next two weeks, Altez said. They reportedly met while she was visiting another inmate at Miguel Castro Castro prison in San Juan de Lurigancho. Joran van der Sloot challenges extradition to U.S. Van der Sloot, 25, pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephany Flores, whose body was found in May 2010 in a Lima hotel room registered in the Dutchman's name. He also has been indicted in the United States on charges related to the disappearance of Holloway. Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance, but was never charged. He has denied responsibility for her disappearance. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of allegedly attempting to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. He was allegedly given $25,000, which authorities say he used to travel to Peru for a poker tournament.","(345, 13)","Infamous Dutch criminal Joran van der Sloot is planning to marry his Peruvian girlfriend in prison, according to reports. Van der Sloot, who is currently serving a 28-year sentence for the 2010 murder of Stephany Flores, will wed Leidy Figueroa next month, in what will be a controversial ceremony. Van der Sloot, who is notorious for his involvement in the disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005, has been criticized for his behavior and lack of remorse. However, his fiancée claims that he is a changed man and that the marriage will help him to turn his life around. According to sources, the wedding will be held in the maximum-security Castro Castro prison in Lima, where van der Sloot is currently being held. The couple have reportedly obtained permission from prison authorities for the ceremony, which will be a low-key affair with only a few guests in attendance. The news has sparked outrage among the families of van der Sloot's victims. Beth Holloway, the mother of Natalee, has accused him of manipulating and deceiving women for personal gain. ""He's not capable of sincere love, he only wants to use women for his own selfish purposes,"" she said. Van der Sloot's own mother, Anita, has also voiced her disapproval of the wedding. ""I do not agree with the wedding, I do not want it and I do not support it,"" she stated. The Peruvian government has yet to comment on the matter, but it is possible that the ceremony could be cancelled if it is deemed to be a security risk. Van der Sloot's notoriety has made him a widely disliked and feared figure in Peruvian prisons, where he is believed to have been the victim of several violent attacks. Whether or not the marriage will benefit him in any way remains to be seen.","(349, 14)","(CNN) -- Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman
while serving a 28-year prison sentence for the 2010 murder of Stephany Flores.
Van der Sloot's lawyer, Maximo Altez, confirmed to CNN that his client is engaged
to Leidy Figueroa, a 22-year-old Peruvian woman who has been visiting him in prison.
Altez said the wedding will take place in the next few months, but he did not
specify an exact date. He said Figueroa and van der Sloot have known each other
for about a year and a half.
Figueroa has visited van der Sloot several times at the Miguel Castro Castro
prison in Lima, where he is serving time for the murder of Flores, a 21-year-old
Peruvian business student who was found dead in a Lima hotel room after van der
Sloot had met her in a casino. Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years in prison
in 2012 after pleading guilty to the crime.
He is also the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee
Holloway, who went missing while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. Van
der Sloot has denied any involvement in Holloway's disappearance.
Altez told CNN that van der Sloot and Figueroa are ""very much in love"" and that
the wedding will take place inside the prison. He added that Figueroa has been
visiting van der Sloot since last year and that they have been communicating
through letters and phone calls. Altez said van der Sloot proposed to Figueroa
earlier this year and that she accepted his proposal.
The lawyer said van der Scoot's family is aware of the engagement and that they
are supportive of the relationship. He added that van der Scoot is looking forward
to the wedding and that he is excited to start a new chapter in his life with
Figueroa. Altez declined to comment on whether van der Scoot would be allowed to
leave prison for the wedding or whether Figueroa would be allowed to enter the
prison for the ceremony. He said the details of the wedding are still being worked
out and that more information will be released in the coming weeks.
Van der Scoot's engagement comes as he continues to serve his sentence for the
murder of Flores. He has maintained his innocence in the case and has claimed
that he acted in self-defense after Flores attacked him. However, prosecutors
argued that he killed Flores in a fit of rage after losing a large sum of money
at the casino. Van der Scoot has also been linked to the disappearance of Holloway
in Aruba, but he has never been charged in that case.
The news of van der Sloot's engagement has drawn mixed reactions from the public.
Some people have expressed support for the couple, while others have criticized
van der Sloot for moving on with his life while serving a lengthy prison sentence.
However, Altez has defended his client's decision to get married, saying that it
is a personal choice and that he should be allowed to start a new life with the
woman he loves. He added that the wedding will be a private affair and that it
will not be open to the public.","(586, 23)",,

'I started to feel pain this week,' she told www.wtatennis.com. 'It didn't feel really well last night at all. I almost didn't go on the court - I did at the last minute. I think it made it a little worse, to be honest. 'It throbs just sitting, standing. I felt it mostly serving because I'm landing on my left knee. That was really killer for me. Moving was okay - I didn't do a tremendous amount of moving last night. I just tried to move as little as possible. So yeah, I felt it mostly when I was serving during the match.

Williams was due to face Stosur on Friday, but decided to withdraw from the tournament after feeling pain in her body. The 34-year-old American had beaten 13th seed Lucie Safarova on Thursday in a tough match that saw her win 6-1, 1-6, 6-2, but she admitted to experiencing pain during the game. Williams said, ""I started to feel pain this week. It didn't feel really well last night at all. I almost didn't go on the court - I did at the last minute."" Her decision to withdraw came as a surprise to many, especially considering how dominant Williams has been over the years. The 22-time Grand Slam winner is known for her fighting spirit and willingness to play through injuries, but clearly, this latest issue was too much to bear. Williams' withdrawal also means that she will not be defending her China Open title, which she won last year. It could also have an impact on her ranking if she misses out on other tournaments in the coming weeks. In addition to Serena's withdrawal, her sister Venus Williams also withdrew from the tournament due to her own health concerns. The sisters have a long history in the sport and are known for their competitive nature, but the current situation demanded that they take a step back and prioritize their health. As for Stosur, she will now advance straight into the last four of the competition, where she will face the winner of the quarterfinal match between Agnieszka Radwanska and Daria Kasatkina. Stosur will no doubt be disappointed by the manner in which she advanced, but she will now have the opportunity to make it to the final and potentially win her first title of the year.

Pupils would be grouped by ability in key subjects in every secondary school under the
","Pupils would be grouped by ability in key subjects in every secondary school under the plans . Secondary schools would be required to teach pupils in sets according to ability under plans being considered by the Tories. They would be penalised for teaching mixed-ability groups for key subjects under controversial proposals to make sets effectively compulsory. The idea is being considered for inclusion in the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto. It would build on the policy blueprint in 2010, which pledged to ‘encourage setting so those who are struggling get extra help and the most able are stretched’. One report claimed Downing Street was pushing for the policy to be announced sooner and had even booked a venue for a launch. But Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted in the Commons there was ‘absolutely no truth’ in the ‘rumours’. She said political opponents had a ‘rather unhealthy interest sometimes in speculating about what I am or am not about to announce’. In an interview she added: 'It’s not something I am looking at.' Both Labour and the Tories have long supported setting but stopped short of making it compulsory. However last year the head of Ofsted called for greater use of sets from age 11 to ensure the brightest pupils reach their potential. Figures suggest the practice of separating children into ability groups does not become widespread until children are 14. Even among older children, not all schools use ability groups in core subjects. Ofsted’s Sir Michael Wilshaw said: 'I’d set from the word go (in secondary schools). 'Too many non-selective schools are failing to nurture scholastic excellence.’ Sources said the idea was ‘under discussion’ and part of the ‘policy debate at the moment’. While in opposition David Cameron called for a ‘grammar stream’ in every subject in all comprehensives. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (left) denied claims the plans would be included in the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto. David Cameron (right) called for a 'grammar stream' in every subject in all comprehensives . He said: ‘I want to see setting in every single school. Parents know it works. Teachers know it works.’ It was claimed yesterday Mr Cameron’s advisers had drawn up plans for a compulsory setting policy. A source close to David Laws, the Lib Dem schools minister, said: ‘This has not been agreed with the Liberal Democrats and is not government policy. 'We don’t believe it would be appropriate to tie schools’ hands in this way.’ And Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘This is an area for teachers to decide and for results to speak for themselves.’ Research published two years ago by the Royal Economic Society showed a higher proportion of ‘low-achieving pupils’ in each class had a ‘negative and significant effect on the academic achievements of regular pupils’ because they monopolised teachers’ attention. The announcement of the plans comes as teachers have been told to consider using seating plans to split up troublemakers and stop pupils choosing to sit with friends.","(579, 24)","The Conservative Party is reportedly considering the inclusion of plans to group all key subjects in secondary schools by pupils' ability in its manifesto for the upcoming 2015 election. Sources within the party have revealed that the plans, which would entail the formation of a 'grammar stream' in every school, have been discussed at the highest levels. Party leader and Prime Minister David Cameron has been a proponent of such a scheme for some time, arguing that it would provide greater opportunities for academically gifted students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In a speech in 2014, Cameron stated that ""we should have a 'grammar stream' in every single school, so that we can stretch our brightest children to the utmost"". The proposed plans would see pupils divided into groups based on their academic ability, with those deemed to be the most capable placed in a 'grammar stream' focused on more challenging coursework. Proponents of the scheme argue that it would enable brighter students to advance at a faster pace, while also freeing up teachers to devote more attention to pupils who are struggling. However, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has denied that the plans will be included in the party's manifesto. Speaking in an interview for BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Morgan stated that ""we have no plans at this stage to introduce any kind of grammar stream or grammar schools"". The proposal has garnered mixed reactions from educational experts and policymakers. Supporters argue that it would allow schools to tailor their teaching methods to individual needs, while also promoting healthy competition among pupils. However, critics have expressed concerns that the scheme could further entrench socioeconomic divides, with disadvantaged pupils potentially being left behind. The prospect of a grammar stream in every school has also raised questions over the future of grammar schools themselves. Currently, grammar schools are only present in a select number of areas in England, and are widely considered to be a controversial form of education due to their selective admissions process. Opponents of grammar schools argue that they unfairly advantage wealthier families who can afford to pay for additional tutoring to prepare for the demanding entrance exams. Supporters, however, argue that they provide a vital form of high-quality education for academically gifted students who may struggle in comprehensive schools. It is unclear whether the Conservative Party will ultimately include plans for a 'grammar stream' in its manifesto for the 2015 election. However, the proposal has reignited a longstanding debate over the merits and drawbacks of selective education, and the best way to provide educational opportunities for all students, regardless of their backgrounds or abilities.","(482, 17)","Pupils would be grouped by ability in key subjects in every secondary school under the

","A robber who stumbled and shot a medical student as he raided a fraternity residence has been found guilty of murder. Dajeon Franklin, 22, had no reaction when a jury convicted him of killing 25-year-old Paul DeWolf in Michigan University's Phi Rho Sigma house last year. He was also found guilty of three home invasions and unlawful possession of a firearm. Relief: Paul DeWolf's family hugged as Dajeon Franklin, 22, was found guilty of his murder last July . Killed: Paul DeWolf, an aspiring pilot, was sleeping in his basement bedroom when the three men broke in .

DeWolf and Franklin struggled, and the gun Franklin was holding went off, striking DeWolf in the neck, prosecutors said. DeWolf's body was found at the fraternity house on July 24, 2013, after he failed to show up for work at a hospital. 'That was very hard,' Paul DeWolf's father Thom DeWolf told Mlive after the verdict. 'You're sitting on pins and needles waiting for the answer. You think there would be some elation or happiness, but there's not. All it does, it's confirming Paul's death.' Robbery: Franklin got in a fight with DeWolf as he and two friends raided the residence at Michigan University . Shot: The gun Franklin was holding went off and hit DeWolf in the neck. DeWolf was found dead the next day . Walter White, Franklin's lawyer, questioned the evidence presented against his client, asking during his closing argument: 'What evidence do we have that Dajeon Franklin was even there and even part of this?' Franklin will be sentenced November 19. His friends and family members left the courtroom in tears, while DeWolf's supporters celebrated with hugs. Tragic: Paul DeWolf's sister Rebekah hugs a detective after Franklin was convicted of murder . DeWolf was from the southwestern Michigan community of Schoolcraft and a graduate of Grand Valley State University. He was a reservist second lieutenant and had planned to join the Air Force full time after graduation. Jordan and Jones are scheduled to stand trial early next year.","(437, 22)","A 22-year-old man named Dajeon Franklin has been convicted of murdering 25-year-old medical student and aspiring pilot, Paul DeWolf. The incident occurred in July of last year when Franklin broke into the Phi Rho Sigma house, located on the campus of the University of Michigan. According to reports, Franklin stumbled over DeWolf, who was sleeping in his room at the time of the break-in. A fight ensued, during which the gun Franklin was holding struck DeWolf, ultimately leading to his death. The aspiring pilot's lifeless body was discovered the following day, sending shockwaves through the campus and the wider Michigan community. Authorities were quick to pursue Franklin following the disturbing incident, and he was subsequently charged with murder. After a lengthy trial, a jury returned a verdict of guilty, and Franklin is now facing the prospect of life imprisonment for the senseless crime. The case has left a deep scar on the University of Michigan community, with many expressing shock and dismay at the loss of such a promising young talent. DeWolf was a beloved member of the Phi Rho Sigma fraternity, and his passion for medicine and flying had made him a popular figure on campus. Following the verdict, DeWolf's family released a statement expressing their relief at the outcome of the trial but also their continued sadness at the loss of their son. They urged the public and authorities to continue to fight against gun violence and to work towards a safer society for all. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan has taken steps to increase security measures across campus, with a view to preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future. Campus officials have also reached out to students and staff, offering support and counseling to anyone struggling with the loss of DeWolf. As the Michigan community continues to mourn the tragic loss of Paul DeWolf, the conviction of Dajeon Franklin serves as a reminder of the devastating impact that gun violence can have on individuals, families, and communities as a whole. It is a tragedy that highlights the need for continued efforts to prevent such senseless crimes from occurring in the future.","(391, 15)","A robber who stumbled and shot a medical student as he raided a fraternity residence

(CNN) -- Riccardo Ricco has been suspended by his Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team amid claims
","(CNN) -- Riccardo Ricco has been suspended by his Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team amid claims that the Italian gave himself a blood transfusion. Ricco -- who only returned to the sport last March after being handed a 20-month ban for doping during the 2008 Tour de France -- was admitted to a hospital in Modena on Sunday. His father told reporters at the time that Ricco had been suffering from a high fever and suspected kidney failure. But Italian media claimed the 27-year-old had admitted to doctors that he had made himself ill by injecting contaminated blood. And now his team have issued an official statement, saying they have found enough proof of a doping infraction to suspend the rider with immediate effect. The statement said: ""Internal research results following the illness and rumors regarding Ricco have given the team sufficient reason to suspend the Italian with immediate effect."" It continued: ""Last Tuesday, the team started an urgent investigation following the hospitalisation of Riccardo Ricco. Three days later the results of this study brought the team to the conclusion that an immediate suspension of Ricco was required. ""The violation of internal regulations of the team and other indications justify this measure. The team cannot prejudge but emphasises that a zero-tolerance policy towards doping is practised."" Blood doping -- an action that increases the amount of red blood cells available to carry oxygen to the muscles -- has been a problem in cycling for a number of years, with disgraced 2006 Tour de France winner Floyd Landis admitting last year that he blood-doped during his career. Blood cells are not damaged by freezing, consequently a ""blood doper"" can remove blood from their body, safely store it, and re-inject it when increased aerobic capacity and stamina is needed. However, if the blood is stored incorrectly, it can become infected, resulting in severe illness if transfused. The practice of blood doping is banned by all official sporting governing bodies and Ricco now faces expulsion from competitive cycling if found guilty, as well as a possible jail sentence in a country where all forms of doping are classed as illegal. Ricco has yet to react to the claims surrounding his hospital stay.","(405, 15)","Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team has announced the suspension of one of its star riders, Riccardo Ricco, after finding enough evidence of his involvement in doping. The team has not revealed the exact nature of the doping infractions, but it was severe enough to warrant suspension from the team. Ricco, a 27-year-old Italian, has been in the headlines for various controversies in the past, including being banned for 12 years by the Italian Olympic Committee for blood doping. His recent hospitalization has further fueled the speculations around his doping practices. Last week, Ricco was admitted to an Italian hospital with a high fever and kidney problems. Italian media claimed that the cyclist fell ill after injecting blood that was infected with a virus. There have been no official reports to confirm these claims. Ricco has been one of the most controversial riders in the sport of cycling, with a history of doping violations. In 2008, he was kicked out of the Tour de France after testing positive for the banned blood-booster EPO. The following year, he was found guilty of doping at the Giro d'Italia and was handed a 20-month ban. Despite the numerous controversies surrounding Ricco, many cycling fans and experts had believed that he had turned over a new leaf and was committed to riding clean. His performances on the road for Vacansoleil have been impressive in recent years, which made the team's decision to suspend him even more surprising. Vacansoleil has been one of the leading voices in the fight against doping in cycling, and their decision to suspend Ricco shows that they are willing to take a tough stance on those who cheat. In a statement released by the team, they said that they were disappointed by Ricco's actions and that they would not tolerate doping in any form. The suspension will no doubt have a significant impact on Ricco's career, as it will likely make it difficult for him to find a new team. It also highlights the ongoing challenges that the sport of cycling faces in the fight against doping. In conclusion, the suspension of Riccardo Ricco by Vacansoleil is a significant moment in the ongoing battle against doping in cycling. It shows that even high-profile riders are not immune to scrutiny and that teams are willing to take a tough stance against cheating. It also raises questions about the future of Ricco's career and the sport of cycling as a whole.","(446, 19)","(CNN) -- Riccardo Ricco has been suspended by his Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team amid claims
that he used performance-enhancing drugs, the team said in a statement Tuesday.
Ricco, 27, was admitted to a hospital in Italy last week after suffering from a high fever and
kidney problems. Italian media reported that he fell ill after injecting himself with infected blood.
The team said it had found enough evidence to suspend Ricco, who won the 2009 Giro d'Italia's King of
the Mountains classification and finished second overall in the 2008 Tour de France.
""Vacansoleil Pro Cycling Team has decided to suspend Riccardo Riccò with immediate effect,"" the team
said in a statement. ""This decision is based on the fact that the team has found sufficient proof of a
doping infraction committed by Riccò during the Vuelta a Espana 2010.""
The team said it would continue to cooperate with the UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale), the sport's
governing body, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
Ricco's agent, Mauro Distefano, told the Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport that his client had
suffered a reaction to a blood transfusion.
Distefano told the newspaper that Ricco had undergone a blood transfusion before the start of the Vuelta
a Espana, a three-week race that began August 28 in Seville, Spain, and ends September 19 in Madrid.
Distefano said Ricco had suffered a reaction to the transfusion, which caused his kidneys to stop
functioning. He said Ricco was now recovering in a hospital in Verona, Italy.
Ricco tested positive for the banned blood-booster CERA (Continuous Erythropoiesis Receptor Activator)
during the 2008 edition of the Tour de France. He was stripped of his second-place finish and banned
from racing for 18 months.
Ricco also tested positive for EPO (erythropoietin) during the 2008 Spanish Vuelta. He was banned from
racing for two years, but the ban was reduced to 18 months on appeal.","(361, 15)",,

BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- Women's boxing will be included at the 2012 Olympic Games in
","BERLIN, Germany (CNN)  -- Women's boxing will be included at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the president of the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday. Germany's Ina Menzer, left, fights American Franchesca Alcanter during a WIBF and WBC featherweight bout in May. The decision came during a two-day IOC Executive Board meeting in Berlin, at which board members also decided to propose golf and rugby for inclusion in the 2016 Olympic Games. ""I can only rejoice about the decision of inclusion of women's boxing,"" IOC President Jacques Rogge told reporters. ""I think it's a great decision. Boxing was the sole (Olympic) sport with no women involved.  ""The sport of women's boxing has progressed a lot, a tremendous amount, in the last five years and it was about time to include them in the Games.""  Have your say - should women's boxing be included? A men's class will likely be axed to make room for three women's weight categories at London 2012, the UK Press Association reported. Women will compete in the flyweight 48-51kg class, lightweight 56-60kg and middleweight 69-75kg, the agency said. When the IOC dropped baseball and softball from the 2012 Olympic program several years ago, it said it would consider adding new sports that had a clean reputation and a wide appeal. Rogge pointed out that women's boxing has around 200 athletes who could potentially compete in 2012, while softball has only around 120. As a result, he said, the IOC considered women's boxing to be more popular. Women's boxing has boomed in Britain since 2005, with the number of registered female fighters rising from 50 to 600, PA reported. Softball and baseball were considered for inclusion in the 2016 Games along with squash, karate, roller sports, golf and rugby, but the board decided to consider only the last two. Blog: IOC has picked the wrong sports, says CNN's Paul Gittings . The IOC has not yet selected the host city for 2016, but its board members will submit golf and rugby to the full IOC session for a final decision at its meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October. ""Golf and rugby scored high on all the criteria,"" Rogge told the IOC's official Web site. ""They have global appeal, a geographically diverse line-up of top iconic athletes and an ethic that stresses fair play."" The International Golf Federation has proposed two four-day strokeplay tournaments for men and women, with 18 holes per round and medals awarded to the three players in each with the lowest scores. The International Rugby Board has proposed men's and women's Sevens tournaments, with 12 teams in each being divided into two pools before semifinals and finals.","(521, 21)","In a historic move for women in sports, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that women's boxing will finally be included in the 2012 Olympic Games in London. This means that for the first time ever, female boxers will be competing alongside their male counterparts for Olympic gold. Up until now, boxing had been the only Olympic event without any female participants. Critics argued that this was outdated and unfair, pointing to the growing popularity of women's boxing around the world. However, it wasn't until recently that the IOC finally agreed to take action. Female boxers will compete in three weight categories: flyweight (48-51kg), lightweight (56-60kg) and middleweight (69-75kg). This will provide a platform for a number of talented female boxers to showcase their skills, and will hopefully inspire more young girls to take up the sport. But boxing isn't the only sport to be considered for inclusion in the Olympics. The IOC is also looking at golf and rugby for the 2016 Summer Games. Both sports have a strong international following, and many believe that they would be a great addition to the Olympic lineup. However, not all sports were so lucky. Softball, squash, baseball, karate and roller sports were all rejected for inclusion in the Olympics. This comes as a disappointment to many athletes and fans of these sports, who had been hoping for their chance to compete on the world stage. Softball, in particular, has a strong case for inclusion. The sport has a large following in many countries, including the United States and Japan, and has been part of the Olympics before. However, the IOC has cited concerns over the lack of global participation as a reason for its exclusion. Similarly, squash and karate have both been seeking Olympic inclusion for years. Squash is played in over 185 countries and has a strong following in many Commonwealth nations, while karate is practiced by millions of people around the world. However, the IOC has yet to be convinced of their Olympic appeal. Whether these sports will ever be included in the Olympics remains to be seen. However, for now, the focus is on women's boxing and the groundbreaking role it will play in the 2012 London Games. With this announcement, the IOC has taken a big step towards gender equality in sports, and has shown its commitment to creating a level playing field for all athletes.","(461, 22)","BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- Women's boxing will be included at the 2012 Olympic Games in

As the cruiser slows down, the video shows the man apparently dismissing him with his hand before starting to climb over the wall. But Kim is quick on his feet and runs towards the man, grabbing him around the chest and pulling him backwards away from the edge. 'Most of what you see in that video is me . thinking on my own, because I didn't want to go over the bridge with . him, so I got down on my knees and pulled him back,' Kim told WBAL. Both men fall on the ground and Kim is able to put handcuffs on him for his own safety, the video shows. The man, who told Kim he had been thinking about jumping off the bridge for about an hour after struggling with medical issues and problems with his daughter, was not charged. Tackle: He grabs him and pulls him back from the edge just moments before the man would have jumped . Saved: He pulls the man to the ground. He later revealed he was suffering medical problems and was having problems with his daughter and had been thinking about jumping off the bridge for an hour . The trooper took him to Hartford Memorial Hospital, where he is being evaluated. Kim has been a trooper for two years and this is the first time he has saved a person's life, Maryland State police spokeswoman Elena Russo told the Havre De Grace Patch. 'It could have been tragic for both of . them,' Russo said. 'It took a lot of courage putting his own life in danger.'

just doing his job when he saw the man on the bridge. “I was just doing what I
was trained to do,” he said. “I didn’t think twice about it. I just did what I
had to do.” He added that he was relieved that he was able to save the man’s
life. “It’s a good feeling to know that I was able to help someone in their
time of need,” he said.

An alleged drunk driver who was dragged 300ft after his car collided with a moving train managed to free himself from the wreckage before knocking on strangers' doors to ask for a place to sleep. Police have said Kyle Randall is believed to have driven through a stop sign before colliding with the moving train in Jefferson, Oregon. The train reportedly dragged the car 300ft before continuing on its journey towards Independence, Oregon. Following the collision however, the 24-year-old managed to free himself from the wreckage. He then went to seek shelter at nearby homes, investigators have claimed. Marion County deputies were first called to the area on Saturday morning after residents reported a man knocking on doors asking for somewhere to sleep, Fox 12 Oregon has reported. Officers discovered Randall's burnt out car after a plume of smoke caught their attention. Marion County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sergeant Chris Baldridge told the Statesman Journal that Randall was being charged with a misdemeanor DUI. He said: 'In order for it to be a felony, you have to have multiple convictions of DUI.' Randall is reportedly facing a single charge because damage was only caused to his property. He is due to appear in court on May 12. Police have said Randall drove through a stop sign before colliding with the moving train .

The incident took place on Wednesday afternoon in West Virginia when Kyle Randall failed to stop at the sign and collided with the train. The train reportedly dragged the car, with Randall still inside, for 300ft. Randall sustained minor injuries and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. After being released from the hospital, he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence. Randall is due to appear in court next month on a misdemeanor DUI charge. According to witnesses, the train had sounded its horn repeatedly before the collision, but Randall appeared unaware of the oncoming train. Local police are urging drivers to exercise caution and comply with traffic rules to avoid such accidents. The incident is a stark reminder of the dangers of driving under the influence and ignoring road signs. The consequences of such actions can not only lead to a collision but can also result in fatalities. Therefore, it is essential that drivers remain cautious and alert at all times when on the road. Train accidents are not uncommon in West Virginia due to the abundance of railway tracks in the area. In 2018 alone, there were 31 train collisions in the state. However, many of these incidents were caused by driver error, such as failing to stop at railroad crossings or attempting to beat the train.

Despite a valiant effort from the Colombian team, Brazil maintained their unbeaten record in the tournament, much to the dismay of the Colombian fans. The game was a tightly contested affair, with both teams showing their attacking prowess early on. But it was Brazil who took the lead in the seventh minute through a brilliant goal from Thiago Silva. The Brazilian captain rose highest to meet a corner and powered a header past the helpless David Ospina in the Colombian goal. Colombia, however, did not let their heads drop and continued to push forward in search of an equalizer. Their efforts were eventually rewarded in the 80th minute when James Rodriguez converted a late penalty to score his sixth goal of the tournament. The 23-year-old Colombian star, who had been a sensation at the World Cup, was in tears at the end of the match, visibly distraught at his team's elimination from the tournament. Despite his disappointment, Rodriguez was consoled by Brazilian star David Luiz. The two hugged and exchanged words of encouragement, demonstrating the sportsmanship and camaraderie that are at the core of the beautiful game. Brazil, who had been rocked by the injury to their talisman Neymar in the previous round, showed great character and resilience to hold on to their lead and secure their place in the semi-finals. The Brazilians will now face Germany, who had earlier thrashed France 4-0 in their quarter-final match. The Brazilian coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari, praised his team's performance and hailed their victory as a ""great moment"". He also paid tribute to the Colombian team and their star player James Rodriguez, calling him a ""phenomenon"". The defeat will no doubt be a bitter pill to swallow for the Colombian team and their fans, who had been dreaming of a historic World Cup triumph. But they can take solace in the fact that they played with spirit and determination throughout the tournament, and gave their all in every match.

Colombia coach Jose Pekerman praised Rodriguez's performance, saying: ""He's a great player and he showed it again today. He's one of the best players in the world and he proved it again today.""

London (CNN) -- Vertical gardens are cropping up all over cities these days, transforming drab
","London (CNN) -- Vertical gardens are cropping up all over cities these days, transforming drab urban facades into vibrant jungles of color. These lush expanses have found their way onto the walls -- both inside and out -- on numerous sites in recent years revitalizing public buildings, hotels, offices and even a multi-storey car park in Netherlands. Aside from their pleasing aesthetic qualities, vertical gardens could also deliver more practical benefits says Mark Laurence, creative director at Biotecture, a UK company who design and build green walls. ""The market is rapidly moving into looking at how they can provide eco-system services and green infrastructures for urban environments,"" Laurence said. Their modular hydroponic system -- where plants sit in a soil-free set up with nutrients delivered through irrigation channels -- can be retrofitted to just about any wall. A recent creation erected on the side of Edgware Road Underground station in central London is hoping to improve air quality. The 200-square meter wall near Marylebone Road -- one of the UK capital's grimiest thoroughfares -- is being monitored by Imperial College, London. ""They have taken initial samples and going at regular intervals to take leaf samples. Then they wash these leaf samples to see how much particulate matter has adhered to the leaves,"" said Laurence. The leaves also have an electrostatic charge that also attracts particles. ""A researcher I was speaking to recently reckons green walls in urban canyon environments (areas where walls are higher than the width of the road separating them) are more effective than trees at collecting particles because the way the wind eddies around and then moves down the wall,"" Laurence said. Some believe that in less polluted areas, green walls could be employed to grow food, which could aid urban food security. Biotecture have successfully trialled a wall which grew 45 varieties of vegetable. Furthermore, there's nothing stopping people building their own, more basic green walls at home, Laurence says. There are various systems for DIY constructions with most requiring a compost-based system, he says, but homemade hydroponic systems can be made using plastic bottles. All you need is irrigation and adequate light.","(402, 16)","A new green wall has been installed near the busy Marylebone Road in London, offering much more than just a stunning vista. Green walls, also known as vertical gardens, have the ability to transform an otherwise plain, concrete building into a colorful and eco-friendly masterpiece. The green wall in Marylebone is expected to improve air quality in the congested urban area, according to the experts behind the initiative. It is widely believed that green walls have the potential to reduce the amount of pollutants in the air by absorbing them through photosynthesis. This new installation is the latest effort to combat the high levels of air pollution in the city. Aside from the ecological benefits, vertical gardens have become an increasingly popular means of enhancing the aesthetic appeal of urban areas. The green wall in Marylebone is no exception, as it radiates a radiant combination of colors and textures that add some much-needed warmth to the dreary concrete facades surrounding it. Green walls can also provide insulation for buildings, reducing the amount of energy needed to cool or heat the interior. This can result in significant savings for building owners, both financially and environmentally. The green wall in Marylebone is just one of many similar initiatives that have been launched in recent years. From New York to Tokyo, vertical gardens have become an integral part of modern cityscapes, with an increasing number of people realizing the benefits of green installations in urban environments. As these initiatives continue to gain momentum, it is becoming increasingly clear that green walls are not just a temporary trend, but a vital part of the sustainable future of cities. Policymakers are now starting to take notice, with green walls and other related initiatives being increasingly implemented in cities across the world. As the population of cities continues to grow, so does the importance of implementing creative and sustainable solutions for urban environments. The green wall in Marylebone is just the latest example of how cities can use innovative solutions to combat the negative effects of urbanization while also improving the lives of city-dwellers with added beauty and health benefits. It remains to be seen what other creative sustainability solutions will emerge, but green walls are an excellent reminder that there are many ways to make cities more livable and eco-friendly.","(417, 16)","London (CNN) -- Vertical gardens are cropping up all over cities these days, transforming drab
urban facades into living works of art. But they can do more than just look good. They can also
improve air quality, according to a new study.
Researchers at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom have found that green walls can
reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a pollutant linked to respiratory problems, by up to 30%.
The study, published in the journal Environmental Pollution, looked at the impact of a green wall
near Marylebone Road, one of London's busiest thoroughfares. It found that NO2 levels were
significantly lower on the side of the building with the green wall than on the side without it.
The researchers say the results suggest that green walls could be an effective way to reduce air
pollution in urban areas. ""Our findings show that green walls can play an important role in
improving air quality in cities,"" said study co-author Dr. David Werner. ""They can help to reduce
levels of NO2, which is a major contributor to poor air quality in urban areas.""
Green walls are becoming increasingly popular in cities around the world. They are often used to
improve the appearance of buildings, but they can also have a positive impact on the environment.
By reducing levels of NO2, green walls can help to improve air quality and reduce the risk of
respiratory problems. This is especially important in urban areas, where air pollution is often a
problem. The study found that the green wall near Marylebone Road reduced NO2 levels by up to
30%. This is a significant reduction, and it shows that green walls can have a real impact on air
quality. The researchers say that more research is needed to determine the full extent of the
benefits of green walls. However, their findings suggest that they could be a valuable tool in the
fight against air pollution. Green walls are not the only way to improve air quality in cities. There
are many other measures that can be taken, such as reducing traffic, improving public transport,
and planting more trees. However, green walls are a relatively simple and cost-effective way to
make a difference. They can be installed on any type of building, and they do not require a lot of
maintenance. In addition, they can provide a number of other benefits, such as improving the
appearance of buildings and providing a habitat for wildlife. Green walls are a win-win solution for
cities. They can improve air quality, reduce the risk of respiratory problems, and make cities more
attractive and livable. As the popularity of green walls continues to grow, it is likely that we will
see more and more of them in our cities in the years to come.","(527, 25)",,

""Kindle Fire is deficient for a media tablet,"" Barnes & Noble CEO William Lynch said as he unveiled his company's Nook Tablet on Monday. ""Content will render better on Nook than on Kindle Fire."" That jab essentially re-opened the fight between Barnes & Noble and Amazon over customers looking for digital-book-reading devices. Round I in this donnybrook was between the Nook and Kindle e-readers. Next week, however, both companies will put their next-generation tablets on the market, setting up a new battle for holiday shoppers looking for gadgets that are good for reading books, watching videos and browsing the Internet. Here's a quick comparison of the devices, which are called the Nook Tablet and Kindle Fire. (The gist, in case you're in a hurry, is that they're pretty darn similar; the Kindle costs $50 less, while the Nook has twice the storage space and a longer advertised battery life). Price . Nook Tablet: $249 . Kindle Fire: $199 . Sale date . Nook Tablet: November 17 . Kindle Fire: November 15 . Screens . Both: 7-inch touch-sensitive screen with color display . Purpose . Both: Reading books, watching videos and browsing the Web. Both of these devices are more focused on the book-reading experience than the Apple iPad, which dominates the tablet field. Operating system . Both: Customized versions of Google Android . Apps . You'd think these Android-based tablets would give owners access to the popular Google Android Market, which houses more than 250,000 apps. But no. Barnes & Noble and Amazon require users to purchase apps through online stores that they've created. Nook Tablet: ""Thousands of must-have apps,"" the company says, including Angry Birds, Scrabble, Bejeweled and Epicurious. Kindle Fire: ""All the most popular apps and games,"" including Angry Birds and Plants vs. Zombies. Storage space . Nook Tablet: 16 GB . Kindle Fire: 8 GB . Memory . Nook Tablet: 1GB of RAM .

The Nook Tablet comes with a 7-inch touchscreen display, which boasts a resolution of 1024x600 pixels. It is powered by a 1GHz dual-core processor and comes with 1GB of RAM, as well as 16GB of built-in storage. It also has a microSD slot, which allows you to expand its storage capacity by up to 32GB. One of the big selling points of the Nook Tablet is its weight. At just 14.1 ounces, it is significantly lighter than the iPad, which weighs in at 1.33 pounds. This makes the Nook more portable and easier to take with you on-the-go. In terms of software, the Nook Tablet runs on Android 2.3 Gingerbread, which has been heavily customized by Barnes & Noble. This includes a custom home screen that highlights the different types of content available, as well as deeper integration with Barnes & Noble services such as its online bookstore. One key feature of the Nook Tablet is its access to Barnes & Noble’s content library, which includes over 2.5 million books, magazines, newspapers, and other types of content. This is comparable to Amazon’s Kindle store, which also offers access to millions of books, magazines, and other types of content. Despite the Nook Tablet’s impressive specs and feature-set, its $249 price point puts it at a disadvantage compared to the Kindle Fire. The Amazon device is currently priced at just $199, which makes it considerably cheaper than the Nook. However, it’s worth noting that the Nook comes with twice as much built-in storage as the Kindle Fire, which only has 8GB. Overall, the Nook Tablet is an impressive device that offers a lot of value for its price. It offers a great way to access Barnes & Noble’s content library and provides a wealth of feature-rich functionalities that make it an exciting device to own. However, with the cheaper Kindle Fire also available, it will be interesting to see how the market responds to this new entrant in the tablet space.","(452, 19)","(CNN) -- The rivalry is so intense that Barnes & Noble actually spoke its competitor's

Discipline device: The shock collar which Diana and Samuel Franklin reportedly used to discipline their adopted teenage daughter when she failed to do chores . Accused: Authorities reportedly say that Diana Franklin, left, and husband Samuel were arrested on Tuesday and are expected to face charges of cruelty to children and false imprisonment . The girl told Georgia Bureau of . Investigation (GBI) agents that her parents shocked her with the collar . several times using a remote key fob. GBI's Wayne Smith told WSB radio in Atlanta: 'The child basically said that there . were just a series of fairly severe, what can be described as . punishments, for various things that the child allegedly did — some as . simple as not doing homework and then others like taking food.' The collar, which usually used on dogs, is now being tested by forensic experts for DNA matches, and reports say it matches the description that the teen gave to agents. Diana Franklin is facing 12 counts of cruelty to children and four counts of false imprisonment, while her Mr Franklin is facing eight counts of cruelty to children and eight counts of false imprisonment. Shocking: The girl was allegedly forced to stay in a chicken coop by Dian and Samuel Franklin . Home: The house where the Franklins live with their adopted daughter in Butler, Georgia . Investigators first started looking into the case at the end of May after receiving tip offs that the girl was being mistreated. Neighbours reported seeing the girl carrying out hard manual labour tasks. Steven Bails said: 'I've seen her out working in the gardens, digging ditches in the hot sun with two or three older boys watching her. 'I've seen her toting rocks up the road - she looked like she was in rough shape.' Another neighbor said Diana Franklin told her she was 'doing what the Bible says' when she disciplined her daughter. The neighbour, who did not give their name told WTVM that the mother would only feed the teen bread and water for days as a punishment. A custody hearing for the teen is due to take place today with the District Attorney taking it over when the criminal investigation is completed. The girl has been in temporary custody of the Department of Family and Child Services for the last few weeks. Use: The shock collar is supposed to be used as an instrument to discipline dogs, as shown here .","(560, 32)","A shocking case of child abuse has come to light after a girl was reportedly given an electric charge for not doing her homework or taking food. The victim, an adopted girl, is said to have been subjected to brutal punishment at the hands of her guardian Diana Franklin. According to reports, Diana Franklin not only gave electric charges to the girl but also told her neighbour that she was 'doing what the bible says'. The neighbour, who remains anonymous, reported the incident to the authorities. The girl's exact age and identity remains unknown, but sources close to the investigation revealed that she suffered from learning difficulties. This makes the abuse she suffered even more disturbing, as she may not have fully understood the consequences of her behaviour. The use of electric charges as a form of punishment is barbaric and illegal. It is believed that the girl was hooked up to a device and then given electric shocks for disobeying Franklin's rules. It is unclear how long this abuse went on for, but neighbours have reported hearing screams and cries coming from Franklin's house at various times of the day and night. It is possible that the girl was being punished regularly and brutally. No arrests have yet been made in the case, but investigations are ongoing. Franklin has remained tight-lipped about the allegations and has not yet spoken publicly about them. Child abuse is a serious problem in many parts of the world, and cases like this serve as a stark reminder of the pain and suffering that children can endure at the hands of those who should be protecting them. The use of electric shocks is particularly concerning, as it shows a willingness to inflict severe pain and suffering. This case has sparked outrage and renewed calls for more to be done to protect vulnerable children from abusive guardians. Many have called for stricter laws and better support services for those who have suffered abuse. In the meantime, the victim in this case is receiving medical and psychological support to help her recover from the trauma she has endured. Her future remains uncertain, but it is hoped that justice will be served and that she will be able to live a life free from abuse and fear. No child should ever have to endure the kind of abuse that this girl allegedly suffered. It is up to all of us to stand up for the rights of children and to speak out against abuse wherever we see it. Only then can we hope to create a safer and more compassionate world for all children to grow up in.","(479, 21)","By. Phil Vinter. PUBLISHED:. 06:13 EST, 12 July 2012. |.
A seven-year-old adopted girl was allegedly given an electric shock by her adoptive mother after she refused to do her homework or eat her dinner.
Diana Franklin, 49, is said to have told a neighbour that she was ‘doing what the Bible says’ when she shocked the child with a Taser stun gun.
The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been taken into care after the alleged incident at the family’s home in North Carolina, US.
Franklin, who has two other adopted children, has been charged with one count of assault on a child under the age of 12 and one count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
She appeared in court yesterday and was released on a $5,000 (£3,100) bond. She is due to appear in court again on August 6.
According to a police report, the girl told a neighbour that her adoptive mother had shocked her with a Taser because she would not do her homework and refused to eat her dinner.
When the neighbour asked the girl if she had been hurt, she replied: ‘Yes, but I’m OK.’
The neighbour then called the police and the girl was taken to hospital where she was found to have no physical injuries.
The girl told police that she had been shocked with the Taser three times – once on her arm, once on her leg and once on her back.
She also said that she had been hit with a belt and a wooden spoon.
The girl’s adoptive father, who has not been named, told police that he was not at home at the time of the incident.
He said that his wife had told him that she had used the Taser on the girl because she was being disobedient.
He said that he did not know that his wife had a Taser and that he had never seen her use it before.
The girl’s biological mother, who has also not been named, said that she had given her daughter up for adoption because she was unable to care for her.
She said that she had no idea that her daughter was being mistreated by her adoptive parents.
The case has sparked outrage in the local community, with many people calling for Franklin to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: ‘This is absolutely appalling. How could anyone do this to a child? I hope they throw the book at her.’
Another resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘I can’t believe this is happening in our community. We need to make sure that this kind of thing doesn’t happen again.’
The case is still under investigation and no further details have been released.

By . Associated Press . Domino's is introducing its own version of Siri. The pizza
","By . Associated Press . Domino's is introducing its own version of Siri. The pizza delivery chain announced on Monday that it is introducing a function on its mobile app that lets customers place orders by speaking with a computer-generated voice named Dom. The rollout is part of an ongoing push by Domino's to take business away from rivals and smaller pizza shops by offering more convenient ways to order. The company, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says the updated app for iPhones and Android devices will deliver a 'human-like, conversational' experience, but notes that it will take some time to work out the kinks in the technology. Ordering just got easier: Domino's is introducing a 'Siri' app so customers can order on mobiles . 'It is not perfect,' Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle said in an interview. 'This is the sort of thing, like any other really new technology launch, you're going to learn, you're going to get better.' Already, mobile and online ordering accounts for 40 percent of Domino's U.S. sales. Growing that portion of its business has become a priority for the chain, with customers increasingly saying they prefer to place orders that way. People who order digitally also tend to spend more and return with greater frequency because they like the convenience, Doyle said. Meanwhile, he noted that smaller pizza shops don't have the money to invest in such technologies. 'It is clearly an area where we'll be able to leverage our scale,' he said. Customers who order pizza with their smart phones spend more . Although other factors have played a role, Domino's credits its digital platforms for helping drive sales. Last year, the company's domestic sales rose 5.4 percent at established locations.Still, compared with many other cuisines, the pizza industry remains fairly fragmented. Four of the national biggest chains — Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's and Little Caesars — together have a little more than 40 percent of the market, according to Doyle. Darren Tristano, an analyst with the industry tracker Technomic, said the major chains have the potential to grow their market share by leveraging national marketing campaign and the ability to offer steeper discounts. And while sophisticated digital ordering platforms give the big chains an edge, Tristano said those technologies will eventually become cheap enough for smaller players to adopt. 'That gap is shrinking,' Tristano said. For now, the voice ordering function on the Domino's app is fairly simple. After pulling up the app, customers type in their address and are taken to the ordering page where they can push a button to order by voice. A voice that identifies itself as Dom walks customers through the process by asking if they want additional toppings or other items. To pay, customers still have to type in their credit card information. Domino's Pizza Inc., which has 5,000 U.S. locations, is partnering with Nuance Communications to offer the technology.","(558, 26)","Domino's Pizza has been working hard to modernize its business, and it looks like those efforts are paying off. According to a recent report, mobile and online ordering now make up 40 percent of Domino's sales in the United States. This is great news for the pizza giant, which has been investing heavily in technology to keep up with changing consumer habits. With more and more people turning to their smartphones and computers to order food, Domino's has been working to make it as easy as possible for customers to order pizza from anywhere, at any time. But it's not just about making ordering easier for customers. Domino's also sees technology as a way to gain an edge over its smaller competitors, who may not be able to afford the same level of investment in digital ordering platforms. ""We believe technology is a strategic advantage, and we're trying to use it in a way that makes a difference to our customers and to our business,"" said CEO Patrick Doyle in a recent interview with CNBC. One way that Domino's is using technology to gain an edge is by offering a seamless ordering experience across multiple channels. Customers can order via the Domino's mobile app, the company's website, or through third-party delivery services. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for customers to place an order, regardless of how they prefer to order. Another way that Domino's is using technology to improve its business is by leveraging customer data to drive sales. According to the company, people who order digitally tend to spend more than those who order over the phone or in person. By analyzing customer data and trends, Domino's is able to create targeted marketing campaigns that encourage customers to spend more when they order. Of course, not every pizza chain has the resources to invest heavily in technology. This puts smaller competitors at a disadvantage, as they may not be able to offer the same level of convenience and ease of ordering that Domino's can. Doyle sees this as an opportunity for Domino's to gain market share and grow its business. ""There are a lot of concepts out there that don't have the capital or the scale to invest in technology in the way that we are,"" he said. ""We think there's a real chance for us to take share in the market from some of those competitors who don't have the scale and the resources that we do."" Overall, it looks like Domino's investment in technology is paying off. Mobile and online ordering now account for a significant chunk of the company's sales, and the company is well positioned to continue growing its business in the years to come. While smaller competitors may struggle to keep up with Domino's technological prowess, the company is confident that it can use its advantage to gain market share and continue growing in the highly competitive pizza industry.","(555, 21)","By. Associated Press. Domino's is introducing its own version of Siri. The pizza
chain said Wednesday that it's rolling out a voice-activated ordering system
that will allow customers to place an order by speaking into their phones.
Domino's says it's the first major restaurant chain to offer such a service.
Customers will be able to say things like ""I'd like a large pizza with pepperoni
and mushrooms"" or ""I'd like to add a side of breadsticks to my order."" They'll
also be able to track the status of their order using voice commands.
Domino's has been working on the technology for more than a year. The company
says it plans to roll out the service to all of its U.S. stores by the end of
the year. The service will be available on both Android and iOS devices.
Domino's isn't the first company to offer voice-activated ordering. Amazon has
been offering a similar service for years. But Domino's says its system is
easier to use because it doesn't require customers to download a separate app.
Instead, they can just use the Domino's app they already have on their phone.
Domino's also says its system is more accurate than Amazon's because it uses
natural language processing to understand what customers are saying. This means
that customers don't have to speak in a certain way or use specific keywords.
They can just speak naturally and the system will understand them.
Domino's hopes that the new service will help it attract more customers and
increase sales. The company has been struggling in recent years as more people
order pizza online or through delivery services like Grubhub and Uber Eats.
Domino's CEO Ritch Allison said in a statement that the new service is ""a
game-changer"" for the company. He said it will make it easier for customers to
order pizza and will help Domino's compete with smaller chains that don't have
the resources to invest in technology.
The new service is just the latest example of how technology is changing the
way we order food. In recent years, we've seen the rise of apps like Seamless
and Grubhub that allow us to order food from our phones. We've also seen the
rise of delivery services like Uber Eats and Postmates that allow us to get
food delivered to our doorsteps. And now, we're seeing the rise of voice-
activated ordering systems like the one Domino's is introducing.
It's clear that technology is changing the way we order food. And it's likely
that this trend will continue in the years to come. So if you're a fan of
pizza, you may want to start getting used to ordering it through your phone or
through a voice-activated system. Who knows, maybe one day you'll be able to
order pizza just by thinking about it.","(536, 29)",,

Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his poor form, according to club
","Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his poor form, according to club legend Ian Rush. The Italian forward has scored just one goal since his £16million summer move from AC Milan, and some supporters have begun to question his worth to the side. But Liverpool's record scorer insisted the 24-year-old has a role to play at the club. Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his slow start at the club, according to legend Ian Rush . 'He still has a future at Liverpool,' Rush told talkSPORT. 'The fans are some of the most patient, but he has to realise he's playing at Liverpool Football Club, not just any other club. 'He's got to show his commitment to the club by proving it on the pitch. 'He's only 24 and he's got to learn he's at ,for me, the best club in the world. You've got to give 100 per cent every time you go out on that pitch.

VIDEO Rodgers laments first-half showing .","(467, 24)","Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli continues to struggle for form and face criticism from fans, with his latest performance against Real Madrid on Wednesday night being one of his worst. The Italian footballer, who joined Liverpool during the summer, has scored just one goal for the club so far, leading to concerns about his future at Anfield. Despite being given a rare opportunity to lead the Liverpool attack against Real Madrid in the absence of Daniel Sturridge and the injured Mario Lambert, Balotelli failed to make any significant impact during the game. In fact, he was so ineffective that he received a zero rating from the Spanish newspaper AS, an embarrassing blow to the striker. Adding further insult to injury, Balotelli was also criticized for swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at halftime during the match. This outraged Liverpool coach Brendan Rodgers, who expressed his disappointment at the incident, suggesting that it reflected poorly on the entire team. However, not everyone is ready to give up on Balotelli just yet. Liverpool legend Ian Rush has come out in defense of the striker, arguing that he still has a future at the club despite his current struggles. According to Rush, Balotelli simply needs more time to adjust to the club and to the Premier League. Balotelli's struggles at Liverpool have been evident from the start, with many fans expressing disappointment in his performances and questioning his commitment to the team. His on-field antics and off-field antics at his previous clubs have also contributed to the negative perception of him. While Liverpool's patience with Balotelli may not have run out just yet, it is clear that the striker must improve his form and attitude quickly in order to avoid being sidelined or even dropped from the squad altogether. If he fails to do so, it may be time for Liverpool to cut their losses and look for alternative options ahead of the January transfer window. Whatever happens, it is clear that Balotelli's future at Liverpool remains uncertain at best. While he may have a special talent on the pitch, his off-field antics and tendency to become distracted by non-football-related matters could make any continued tenure at the club impossible.","(403, 15)","Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his poor form, according to club
legend Ian Rush. The Italian striker has struggled to make an impact at Anfield since
joining from AC Milan last summer, scoring just one goal in 16 appearances. His
performance against Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday night was
particularly disappointing, with Spanish newspaper AS giving him a rating of zero.
Balotelli has also come under fire for swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe
at half-time, an incident which Brendan Rodgers described as ""unacceptable"". However,
Rush believes that the 24-year-old still has a lot to offer the club and should be given
a chance to prove himself. ""I think he's still got a future at Liverpool,"" Rush told Sky
Sports News. ""He's only been here a short time and I'm sure he'll come good. He's a
talented player and we all know what he can do when he's on form."" Balotelli joined
Liverpool from AC Milan in a £16million deal last August but has failed to live up to
expectations so far. His only goal for the club came in a 3-1 win over Swansea in the
FA Cup third round back in January. Since then, he has started just three Premier
League games and been substituted in all but one of his other appearances. Despite
his struggles, Balotelli remains confident that he can turn things around. ""I'm not
worried about my form,"" he said after the game against Real Madrid. ""I know I can do
better and I'm working hard to get back to my best."" It remains to be seen whether
Rodgers will give Balotelli another chance to prove himself or whether he will be
allowed to leave the club in the summer transfer window.","(337, 15)",,

His family have been told of the climber’s tragic fall, which happened yesterday afternoon. The man, who was visiting the area on holiday, had been traversing the cliffs at Dancing Ledge, a popular location for climbers on the Jurassic Coast. The beauty spot on the Isle of Purbeck was featured in the BBC’s 2008 adaptation of Thomas Hardy’s novel Tess of the D’Ubervilles which starred Gemma Arterton and Eddie Redmayne. Climbers flock to the picturesque location because it boasts a small 10 metre high cliff close to the sea and a larger 20 metre high limestone cliff set a little way back from the smaller drop. 'On the afternoon of Thursday, August 23 Dorset Police and the coastguard were called to the scene of a climbing accident at Dancing Ledge, near Swanage,' said Inspector Debbie Martin.

The couple had been taking in the stunning panoramic views of the Jurassic Coast from the top of the cliff when the man suddenly lost his footing and fell to his death into the ocean below.  Although rescue teams rushed to the scene, tragically the man could not be saved. Dorset Police officers pointed out that this is not the first time such an unfortunate incident has taken place on this spot.

","By . Peter Allen . The bodies of five First World War soldiers have been found ‘frozen in time’ in a French wood almost 100 years to the day since they were killed. All are believed to have died on September 5th 1914, the day of a ferocious fire fight between the Allies and Germans near Luneville, in eastern France. The find is particularly poignant this week, when millions around the world will focus on the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy. The bodies of five French soldiers from the First World War have been found in a forest near Luneville almost 100 year since they were killed (pictured, French troops attack at Verdun, near to Luneville) The French infantrymen’s skeletons lay undiscovered for all those years, along with their Lebel rifles, wallets, and a figurine of the Virgin Mary. Philippe Sugg and Gerard Louis, two local historical researchers, made the discovery after studying First World War archives and pinpointing digging sites. The men were in a private forest, which remained practically untouched throughout the decades since the fighting. Mr Sugg said: ‘Documents suggest that several dozen soldiers died in the area. They were often very young men who left their families knowing there was a good chance they would never return.’ Among those ‘frozen in time’ is a 27-year-old from the southern town of Perpignan, whose name is on an identification tag. Later this week the Queen will be in France to commemorate 70 years since the D-Day landings happened in Normandy during the Second World War . Scraps of the red trousers which the French still wore at the beginning of the war were also found. Once his descendants have been informed, his body is likely to be exhumed and buried with full military honours, along with his comrades. Despite the passing of the years, France and neighbouring countries are still covered with the bodies of those who died in the First and Second World War. The Queen and other members of the Royal Family will arrive in France on Thursday to honour the sacrifice of such fallen heroes. She will be on Sword Beach on June 6th, D-Day, at a commemorative ceremony also attended by French and American presidents Francois Hollande and Barack Obama.","(420, 16)","The discovery of the bodies of five French soldiers has sent shockwaves through the Northeastern French town of Luneville. The soldiers' remains were found in a nearby wood, next to their rifles, wallets, and a statue of the Virgin Mary. It is believed that they died in a fight almost 100 years ago to the day. Local authorities are working to identify the soldiers and trace their families. The discovery has caused a great deal of reflection on the sacrifice that was made during World War I. The timing of the discovery has also brought back memories of the great losses that France endured during the Great War. The discovery of the soldiers was made by a group of hikers who were exploring the woods. They noticed a mound of earth that looked like it had been recently disturbed. Upon closer inspection, they found the remains of the soldiers. The hikers immediately contacted local authorities, who cordoned off the area and began their investigations. It is unclear at this time how the soldiers died or who they were fighting against. The woods where the remains were found was a site of intense fighting during World War I, with trench lines running through the area. The discovery of the soldiers has also ignited a debate about the use of war memorials and the importance of remembering those who have died in war. Many in Luneville are calling for a memorial to be built in honor of the soldiers who were found in the woods. The mayor of Luneville, Albert Jacquart, has said that the discovery of the soldiers is a reminder that ""war is always a tragedy"" and that it is important to work towards a peaceful future. He has also called on the French government to adequately fund the maintenance of war memorials and to provide support to the families of soldiers who have died in the line of duty. The discovery of the soldiers is a poignant reminder of the cost of war and the sacrifice that was made by so many during World War I. As France prepares to mark the centenary of the end of the war, the discovery of the soldiers will undoubtedly play a key role in the commemorations. It is hoped that their families can be identified and that they can be given the honor and recognition that they deserve.","(427, 19)","By. Peter Allen.

The snug-fitting Equafleece, which comes in three colours, is said to relax nervous dogs, in the same way that swaddling soothes fractious babies. As stress levels fall, the dogs find it easier to breathe and cope with their fears. Scroll down for video . Tate the Tibetan Terrier wears his calming Equafleece which comes in three colours . By lightly touching the skin from back to belly, it is believed to encourage the release of oxytocin, the ‘cuddle hormone’ credited with creating feelings of calmness and closeness. Tate, a Tibetan terrier, is put in his Equafleece two or three times a week. His owner, Lisa D’Aguiar, of North London, said: ‘He panics if he hears people outside. ‘The T-shirt makes him calmer. His nerves don’t completely go away but he is chilled and he looks adorable in it.’ Another happy customer, Kate Reeves . from Shropshire, said: ‘I cannot believe how incredibly effective the . t-shirt was in calming my very anxious greyhound and how quickly she . changed from a shaking, drooling wreck into a snoozing, relaxed dog. ‘It continued to work brilliantly during fireworks and thunderstorms.’ Animal behaviour specialist Sarah Fisher says the Equafleece can also be used to reassure dogs that are anxious about travelling in a car or nervous of other animals. Matilda the British bulldog sports another variation of the t-shirt which is said to calm nervous dogs . Tate, Molly and Matilda pose in their Equafleeces that come in different sizes, the smallest being for a Chihuahua . Miss Fisher believes the hug-like feel of . the cotton over-rides the brain’s primeval instinct of fight or flight . in terms of trouble. Those with two legs also benefit. She said: ‘The owner feels he has . something proactive to do to help their dog instead of them getting . worked up by whatever is going on.' Miss Fisher, who assesses dogs for . court cases and teaches staff at animal shelters including Battersea . Dogs Home, said that a normal T-shirt should also have a calming effect. However, the Equafleece is a better option as it is doggy-shaped and contains enough stretch to allow pets to move properly. She said: ‘I am not a fan of dressing up dogs but I am a fan of t-shirts for dogs because they are so calming.’ Dog coats and jackets are thought to be less beneficial because they do not completely close over the belly and so fail to make the creature feel like it is being enveloped in a hug. The Equafleece t-shirts start at £13 for a Chihuahua or a small terrier. An XL shirt, for a retriever or a large greyhound costs £19.","(548, 37)","Equafleece: The Miracle T-Shirt for Dogs A new product has hit the market that has dog owners wagging their tails with excitement. The Equafleece, a t-shirt designed specifically for dogs, has been receiving rave reviews from pet owners who swear by its calming benefits.  The Equafleece is available in different sizes and colors, ensuring that dogs of all breeds and sizes can enjoy the benefits of this revolutionary product. But what makes it so special? According to animal experts, the Equafleece has calming properties that can help soothe nervous dogs and make them feel more relaxed. One of the most common uses for the Equafleece is during car journeys. Many dogs can get anxious or nervous during car rides, but the Equafleece can help ease their nerves and make the journey much more enjoyable for everyone involved. It does this by providing a snug fit that makes dogs feel secure and comfortable.  But it’s not just during car rides that the Equafleece comes in handy. Pet owners have reported that it can also help settle dogs around other animals, especially if they are prone to barking or getting agitated in social situations. The snug fit of the Equafleece is said to provide a sense of comfort and security, which helps dogs feel more at ease in these situations. The Equafleece is also said to have benefits for dogs with respiratory problems. Its design is such that it promotes more comfortable breathing in dogs, which can be particularly helpful for brachycephalic breeds (dogs with short noses) who are prone to breathing difficulties.  So, how does the Equafleece work? Experts say that the snug fit of the t-shirt works similarly to the effect of swaddling a baby – it provides a sense of security and comfort that can help calm the nervous system. This effect can be particularly helpful during stressful situations such as thunderstorms or fireworks displays, which can be particularly challenging for some dogs. The Equafleece is made from high-quality materials that are soft and comfortable for dogs to wear. It’s also machine washable, which is particularly convenient for pet owners. The fleece is made to last, ensuring that dogs can enjoy its calming benefits for years to come. Overall, the Equafleece has been receiving enthusiastic praise from pet owners and animal experts alike. It’s a game-changer for dog owners who have struggled with nervous or anxious pooches, and it’s certainly worth considering for any pet owner looking to make their dog’s life as comfortable and stress-free as possible.","(467, 21)","By.

The Equafleece has been hailed as a life-saver for dogs who suffer from separation anxiety and travel sickness.
The t-shirt, which is designed to fit snugly around a dog’s body, is said to calm the animal’s nerves and help it to breathe more easily.
It is also claimed that the fleece can settle dogs when they are around other animals, such as cats, and make car journeys less stressful.
The t-shirt is available in a range of colours and sizes to suit dogs of all shapes and sizes.
It is made from a special material that is designed to wick moisture away from the dog’s skin, keeping it dry and comfortable.
The t-shirt also has a built-in cooling system that helps to regulate the dog’s body temperature, keeping it cool in hot weather and warm in cold weather.
According to the manufacturer, the t-shirt can help to improve a dog’s quality of life by reducing stress and anxiety.
It is also said to help dogs who suffer from respiratory problems, such as asthma, by making it easier for them to breathe.
So far, the t-shirt has been a hit with dog owners, with many reporting that their pets are calmer and happier since they started wearing it.
One owner, who asked not to be named, said: “My dog used to get really anxious when I left the house, but since she started wearing the t-shirt, she’s much calmer.
“She still gets excited when I come home, but she’s not as stressed out as she used to be.”
Another owner, Sarah Smith, said: “I bought the t-shirt for my dog because she suffers from travel sickness.
“Since she started wearing it, she’s much more relaxed in the car and she doesn’t vomit as much.
“I would definitely recommend the t-shirt to other dog owners – it’s a great way to help your pet feel more comfortable and relaxed.”
If you’re thinking of buying a t-shirt for your dog, there are a few things you should keep in mind.
First, make sure you choose the right size – the t-shirt should fit snugly around your dog’s body, but not too tight.
Second, make sure you wash the t-shirt before you put it on your dog – this will help to remove any chemicals or dyes that could irritate your dog’s skin.
Finally, be patient – it may take a few days for your dog to get used to the t-shirt, so don’t give up if they don’t seem to like it at first.","(518, 21)",,

(CNN) -- Tourists staying at Ao Phrao (Phrao Bay) on Thailand's island of Koh Samet
","(CNN) -- Tourists staying at Ao Phrao (Phrao Bay) on Thailand's island of Koh Samet have been evacuated as the bay turned black from an oil spill over the weekend. Authorities estimated that around 5,000 liters of crude oil have washed up on the island, having leaked into the ocean from an offshore pipeline belonging to PTT Global Chemical, Thailand's largest petrochemical producer. The total leakage is estimated at 50,000 liters. Due to its beautiful beaches and proximity to Bangkok -- the travel time from the capital is a little less than four hours by bus and then boat -- the island has long been a popular Thai weekend destination. Tourist activities on the island are largely ocean-oriented and include jet-skiing, snorkeling and banana-boating. Gallery: Oil spill on Koh Samet . Effect on tourism . It's still unclear to what extent the spill will affect local tourism, but the damage was initially reportedly limited to one beach, at Ao Phrao. There are 14 beaches on the island. ""We've had some hotel cancellations on Samet,"" Rayong province tourism authority director Chuchart Oncharoen told the Bangkok Post. ""Whether this has a long-term impact on the island depends on how quickly PTT cleans up the mess."" The affected beach is on the less populated Western part of the island, where resorts have closed and tourists have been evacuated to hotels in other areas. The island is currently in its tourism low season -- the high season is from October to April.

The environmental group Greenpeace also called the spill ""massive,"" according to the ABC, and called upon the Thai government to end oil exploration in the Gulf of Thailand. Some travelers to Phrao Bay have already posted about the unexpected change in their itineraries.

""We rebooked to a hotel on Ko Chang and the personnel at Lima Coco were very helpful getting us there. We also got a voucher covering the days we paid in advance,"" wrote MatJens on Monday. A statement from PTT Global Chemical said the company had deployed booms to contain the oil as well as oil spill dispersant. It added that the Thai navy and approximately 300 workers from PTT Global Chemical are continuing to clean up the area.","(571, 24)","One of Thailand's most prized weekend getaway destinations has found itself in a sticky situation. The picturesque shoreline of Koh Samet island, located off the eastern coast of Thailand, has been turned black due to an oil spill that occurred on Saturday.  Approximately 5,000 liters of oil have washed ashore since the spill, and though cleanup efforts are underway, concerns are growing over the potential impact on the island's ecosystem. Koh Samet is known for its vibrant coral reefs, tropical fish, and crystal-clear waters. The oil spill raises concerns about the possible damage to marine life and the wider ecosystem. The spill occurred on Saturday in the Gulf of Thailand, impacting the pristine sands and waters of Koh Samet's Ao Phrao Beach. The spill was first noticed by local residents and visitors in the early morning hours as black sludge began to infiltrate the shoreline.  Authorities have yet to determine the cause of the oil spill but are urging visitors to steer clear of the affected areas. Tourists and locals alike have been advised to avoid swimming or engaging in water-based activities until the situation is resolved. Environmental groups, including Greenpeace, have voiced their concerns about the potential long-term impact of the spill. ""This spill may be worse than first thought,"" said an opposition MP, citing the potential damage to local marine life and the wider ecosystem of the Gulf of Thailand. Efforts are now underway to contain the spill and prevent further damage to the islands. Cleanup crews have been dispatched to the affected areas, and more are expected to arrive in the coming days. They are using a variety of techniques to clean up the sludge, including the use of specialized equipment, such as skimmers and absorbent pads, to soak up the oil. Despite this, concerns remain that the spill may have already caused irreparable damage. Tourism officials are concerned about the impact on local businesses, as Koh Samet is one of the most popular weekend getaway destinations in Thailand. Local businesses, including hotel owners and dive companies, are already feeling the pinch as vacationers cancel their bookings and steer clear of the affected areas. The long-term impact on the economy of Koh Samet and the surrounding region remains unclear. Authorities are urging visitors to remain vigilant, and to report any further signs of oil washing up on the island's shores. The future of Koh Samet remains uncertain, but officials are hopeful that prompt action and cooperation between authorities, local businesses, and community members can help to minimize the damage caused by this devastating oil spill.  It is a somber reminder that the convenience that oil brings to the economy should always be balanced with the responsible consideration of its impact on the environment.","(506, 21)","(CNN) -- Tourists staying at Ao Phrao (Phrao Bay) on Thailand's island of Koh Samet
have been forced to leave after the beach turned black from an oil spill that began
on Saturday, according to local media reports.
Koh Samet is one of Thailand's most popular weekend getaway destinations. The
island is located in the Gulf of Thailand, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) southeast
of Bangkok. It is part of the Khao Laem Ya-Mu Ko Samet National Park, which was
declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019.
According to the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, approximately 5,000
liters (1,320 gallons) of oil have washed ashore on the island. The cause of the
spill is still under investigation, but initial reports suggest that it may have
been caused by a leak from a tanker ship.
The spill has had a significant impact on the local tourism industry. Many hotels
and resorts on the island have been forced to close their doors, and those that
remain open have seen a sharp decline in bookings. Local businesses have also been
hard hit, with many reporting a significant drop in sales.
In addition to the economic impact, the spill has also had a negative impact on the
environment. The oil has coated the sand and rocks on the beach, making it difficult
for marine life to survive. The spill has also contaminated the water, making it
unsafe for swimming and other water activities.
The Thai government has launched an investigation into the cause of the spill and
is working to clean up the affected areas. However, the cleanup process is expected
to take several weeks, and the full extent of the damage is still unknown.
In the meantime, tourists are being advised to avoid the affected areas and to
exercise caution when swimming or engaging in other water activities. The Thai
government has also set up a hotline for residents and tourists to report any
suspicious activity or to seek assistance.
The oil spill on Koh Samet is just the latest in a series of environmental disasters
that have plagued Thailand in recent years. In 2018, a massive oil spill in the Gulf
of Thailand killed thousands of fish and other marine life. And in 2019, a fire at
a chemical plant in Rayong province released toxic chemicals into the air, forcing
thousands of residents to evacuate their homes.
These incidents highlight the need for stronger environmental regulations and
enforcement in Thailand. The Thai government has taken some steps to address these
issues, but more needs to be done to protect the environment and the people who
depend on it for their livelihoods.
In conclusion, the oil spill on Koh Smet has had a devastating impact on the local
tourism industry and the environment. The Thai government is working to clean up
the affected areas and investigate the cause of the incident, but the full extent of
the damage is still unknown. This incident serves as a reminder of the need for
stronger environmental regulations and enforcement in Thailand to protect the
environment and the people who depend on it.

Your article is well-written and informative, but there are a few areas where you can
improve your writing skills.
Firstly, you should try to use a wider range of vocabulary to make your writing more
interesting and engaging. For example, instead of using the word ""significant"" to
describe the impact of the oil spill, you could use a more descriptive word like
""devastating"" or ""catastrophic."" Similarly, instead of saying that the spill has
""coated"" the sand and rocks, you could say that it has ""covered"" or ""blanketed"" them.
By using more descriptive language, you can make your writing more vivid and
Secondly, you should work on your sentence structure. Your sentences are generally
short and simple, which can make your writing sound repetitive and monotonous. Try
to vary your sentence structure by using longer and more complex sentences. For
example, instead of saying ""Many hotels and resorts on the island were forced to
close their doors,"" you could say ""The oil spill forced many hotels and resorts on
the island to close their doors.""
Finally, you should pay attention to your grammar and punctuation. While your
article is generally well-written, there are a few grammatical errors and
punctuation mistakes that you should correct. For example, you should use commas to
separate items in a list, and you should use apostrophes to indicate possession.
By paying attention to these details, you can improve the overall quality of your
writing and make it more polished and professional.
Overall, your article is a good start, but there is still room for improvement. By
working on your vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar, you can take your
writing to the next level and become a more effective communicator.","(914, 38)",,

Her tales have enchanted generations of English children and now Beatrix Potter is set to win another fan - baby Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge has decorated his nursery with characters from Beatrix Potter's classic children's book, it has emerged. While Kensington Palace officials are said to have suggested antique furniture as more befitting a future king, Kate had her heart set on a Beatrix Potter theme. Classic tales: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured holding Prince George as she leaves St Mary's Hospital in London with husband Prince William, is believed to have chosen a Beatrix Potter theme for her son's nursery . And her mother-in-law Camilla took her side - insisting the nursery should be decorated to Kate's liking. A source told The Sun: 'Camilla has experience in dealing with the ""old grey men"". She put her foot down, saying it should be Kate's choice.' The pair are said to have become very close since Kate became pregnant with her first child George who was born on July 22. The source added that the Duchess loves how Camilla treats George like any grandchild who 'wees, vomits and does everything babies do'. With help from her mother-in-law, 31-year-old Kate is believed to have ordered that the nursery be decorated with characters from Beatrix Potter's books. Popular: Peter Rabbit, depicted eating radishes, is likely to be one of the Beatrix Potter characters adorning Prince George's walls . One of her most popular characters who is likely to adorn the Prince's walls is Peter Rabbit. The Tale of Peter Rabbit and his sisters Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail was first published more than 100 years ago but is still one of the most popular children's books today. Other famous characters include Jemima Puddle-Duck, Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, Tom Kitten and Miss Moppet. It has been speculated that kate and her husband Prince William are likely to have used the same design company that created nurseries for William himself, his brother Harry and their cousins Beatrice and Eugenie. Dragons of Walton Street in Knightsbridge specialise in handmade furniture painted with characters from Beatrix Potter, bears, flowers or fairies. Home to a prince: Kensington Palace officials felt that antique furniture in the nursery would be more in keeping with the style of the property, pictured, but they were overruled by Kate and her mother-in-law Camilla .","(466, 24)","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have always had a preference for classic and antique pieces when it comes to their home decor. When it came time to decorate their eldest son's nursery in Kensington Palace, palace officials suggested classic antique pieces to adorn the room. However, the Duchess had a different idea in mind - she wanted to incorporate the beloved characters from Beatrix Potter's renowned children's books into the room. Beatrix Potter was a British author and illustrator known for her beloved children's books. Even though her tales were written over 100 years ago, they remain some of the most popular and cherished books for children of all ages. One of her most beloved stories is ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit"", which follows the adventures of Peter and his sisters Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail. Despite the palace officials' suggestion, the Duchess knew that the charm of Beatrix Potter's tales would be the perfect fit for her son George's nursery. The walls of the room were adorned with whimsical illustrations of the iconic Peter Rabbit and his mischievous adventures in Mr. McGregor's garden. The illustrations were rendered in soft pastel shades and were the perfect complement to the neutral-toned furnishings in the room. The Duchess also incorporated other characters from Beatrix Potter's books into her design, including Jemima Puddle-Duck and Tom Kitten, to name a few. The entire room was filled with references to the beloved literary works, making it a space that was magical and full of wonder. The Duke and Duchess' choice to incorporate the timeless Beatrix Potter characters into their son's nursery speaks to their appreciation for classic literature and the importance of sharing it with their children. They join a long list of parents who have embraced the characters and stories in their own homes, making it a tradition that has spanned generations. As for the antique pieces that were recommended by the palace officials - they were not forgotten. The Duke and Duchess incorporated some of these items into other areas of Kensington Palace, where they added a touch of history and character to their already stunning residence. In conclusion, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's decision to decorate their son's nursery with illustrations from The Tale of Peter Rabbit is a testament to the enduring appeal of Beatrix Potter's literary works. The room exuded a sense of charm and wonder that will no doubt inspire and captivate their children for years to come. Being an example of how classic literature can still hold a special place in everyone's heart even as the years go by.","(480, 18)","By. Suzannah Hills. PUBLISHED:. 06:15 EST, 10 August 2013. |.

A soldier from the Royal Engineers was killed in action in Afghanistan, the Ministry of Defence said. The serviceman was killed yesterday as a result of enemy fire while on operations east of Kabul. His next of kin have been informed and have requested the customary period of grace before further details are released, a spokesman said. The death takes to 447 the number of UK service members who have lost their lives since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001, and is the ninth this year. A British soldier watches an air attack from an Apache helicopter in Afghanistan (file picture) The majority of British forces are in Helmand Province, in the south of the country, but some also operate elsewhere, including in and around the capital, Kabul. The drawdown of British troops is under way, and all combat troops are due to have left by the end of 2014. There are just four bases remaining outside Camp Bastion, due to be closed down one by one in the new year, and the number of personnel has been reduced from 9,000 at the start of the year to around 5,200. A British soldier on standby as a Chinook helicopter brings supplies in Afghanistan (file picture) During a pre-Christmas visit to Helmand last week, David Cameron said Britain had accomplished its mission in Afghanistan. Touring Camp Bastion in what is likely to be his last seasonal meet-and-greet with troops on the ground there, the Prime Minister said: 'To me, the absolute driving part of the mission is a basic level of security so it doesn't become a haven for terror. 'That is the mission, that was the mission and I think we will have accomplished that mission and so our troops can be very proud of what they have done.'","(358, 17)","A total of 447 British service members have been killed in Afghanistan since the start of the war in 2001, according to recent reports. The news comes as the UK's drawdown of troops accelerates, with all forces set to be out of the country by the end of 2014. The number of UK troops in Afghanistan has been decreasing steadily in recent years, as the coalition forces make preparations for the end of their mission. The UK currently has around 9,000 military personnel in Afghanistan, down from a peak of nearly 10,000 in 2012. The UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan comes as part of the coalition's transition to Afghan-led security, which has been in motion since 2011. This process aims to hand over security responsibility to Afghan forces, with the goal of enabling the country to take control of its own affairs. The drawdown of UK forces has not come without sacrifice, however. Of the 447 British service members who have lost their lives in Afghanistan, 404 were killed as a direct result of hostile action. The remaining 43 died from illness, non-combat injuries, or accidents. The UK has been involved in the conflict in Afghanistan since 2001, when a US-led coalition invaded the country in response to the September 11th terrorist attacks. British forces have played a major role in the conflict, contributing to efforts to provide security, reconstruct infrastructure, and support economic development. Despite the sacrifices made by the UK and other coalition forces, many experts believe that the war in Afghanistan has not resulted in a decisive victory. Critics argue that the presence of foreign forces has only served to perpetuate the conflict, and that the war's long-term effects on the region remain uncertain. As the UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan continues, the country will face new challenges in its efforts to promote stability and security both at home and abroad. While the future remains uncertain, the sacrifice of those who have lost their lives in service to their country will not be forgotten.","(373, 15)","By. Ted Thornhill.

Blown away: Shocked Jessica Parsons had to leave a pub when a bouncer thought she had taken cocaine . Pub staff kicked out two women who blew their noses - because they thought they were using cocaine. Nursery worker Jessica Parsons, 23, refused to let the common cold stop her from enjoying a night out with two friends at a pub in Cheam, Surrey. But when she and one of her friends blew their noses in the toilet, they were accused of taking Class A drugs. A female bouncer confronted them when they left their cubicles and ordered them to leave. Shocked Miss Parsons says she will never return to the pub, which she has been visiting since she was 18. The incident happened on Saturday night at the Harrow Inn, where staff have defended their actions. Miss Parsons said: 'It was about half nine and we went to the toilet. Because we both had colds we both blew our noses while we were in there. We weren’t in the same cubicle or anything like that. 'As we left, one of the female bouncers pulled us back and said ""come with us"". 'They said there was a drug problem and that they heard us sniffing drugs in there. 'I told them I blew my nose because I have a cold and laughed because I thought it was a joke - I don’t even smoke, let alone do cocaine! 'We both have respectable jobs and we just wanted to go out for a quiet drink. I work in a school, there is no way I would risk that. 'I asked them to call the police but they wouldn’t and they just told us to leave, so we had to go and leave a bottle of wine we’d just bought on the table.' Miss Parsons said she has been going to the pub regularly since she was 18, but now plans never to return. Not to be sniffed at: Miss Parsons, pictured, said she and her friend had to leave a bottle of wine behind . A manager at the pub, who declined to give his full name asking only to be identified as Sam, said: 'We have a high rate of drugs issues in the area and our place is one of the red alert places. 'We have three door staff who will deal with situations when there is the slightest suspicion. If, in this case, we have made a mistake then it would be the first time.

""We have to be constantly on the lookout for anyone who may be breaking our rules or causing a disturbance."" This incident has sparked a debate about security in pubs and other public places. While some argue that bouncers and security personnel need to be vigilant to ensure the safety of patrons, others feel that incidents like this are an overreaction and can be harmful to innocent people. Parsons, for her part, has decided not to return to the Harrow Inn. ""I don't feel safe going back there,"" she said. ""If they're going to kick me out for blowing my nose, what else might they do?"" This sentiment has been echoed by many on social media, with some calling for a boycott of the Harrow Inn and other pubs that exhibit similar behavior. Others, however, have defended the pub's right to enforce its own rules and protect its patrons. Regardless of the outcome of this particular incident, it is clear that the issue of security in public places is one that will continue to be debated for some time to come.

A young woman who was thrown out of a pub for blowing her nose has vowed never to return – because she doesn’t even smoke.
Jessica Parson, 23, had been enjoying a night out with two friends at the Harrow Inn, in Cheam, south-west London, when bouncers overheard her and a friend sneezing and blowing their noses.
They were then told to leave the pub because they were suspected of taking cocaine.
Miss Parsons, who does not smoke or take drugs, said: ‘I don’t even do cocaine, let alone blow my nose.’
She added: ‘I’m not going back to that pub. I don’t want to spend my money in a place where I’m treated like that.’
Miss Parsons, from Sutton, Surrey, had gone to the Harrow Inn with two friends on Saturday night.
She said: ‘We were just having a good time. We weren’t rowdy or anything. We were just having a laugh.
‘We were sitting at the bar and one of my friends started sneezing. Then I started sneezing as well.
‘One of the bouncers came over and asked us what we were doing. We told him we were just sneezing.
‘He told us we had to leave because he thought we were snorting cocaine.’
Miss Parsons said she and her friends were escorted out of the pub by the bouncers.
She added: ‘It was really embarrassing. I felt like I was being treated like a criminal.
‘I don’t know why they thought we were taking drugs. I don’t even smoke.’
Miss Parsons’ friend, who did not want to be named, said: ‘We didn’t do anything wrong. We were just sitting at the bar having a good time.
‘We weren’t causing any trouble. The bouncers shouldn’t have treated us like that.’
A spokesman for the Harrow Inn said: ‘The Harrow Inn is a lively pub and as such we have to be very careful when it comes to security.
‘We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to drugs. If we suspect someone is taking drugs we will ask them to leave.

Angry parents had 'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' struck off the reading list for 11-year-old kids attending Public School/Middle School 114 in Rockaway Park, Queens because they objected to passages about masturbation. All incoming sixth-graders had been originally expected to write a graded-essay on the book, until outraged parents raised their objections. The award-winning young adult novel, by author Sherman Alexie, is about a Native American boy who transfers into an all-white high school. It includes lines such as: ‘And if God hadn’t wanted us to masturbate, then God wouldn’t have given us thumbs. So I thank God for my thumbs.’ One angry parent said she didn’t want the school dictating when she had to discuss masturbation with her son. ‘It’s about... masturbation - which is not appropriate for my child to learn at 11,’ Kelly-Ann McMullan-Preiss, 39, told the New York Daily News.

'To pretend that kids aren’t dealing with this on an hour-by-hour basis is a form of denial.' The book won the 2007 National Book Foundation award for Young People's Literature.

A book called ""The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian"" was assigned to 6th-grade students at the school, prompting outrage from parents who felt the content was inappropriate for their children. While the book has been praised for its portrayal of Native American culture and the challenges faced by Indigenous youth, some parents objected to its depictions of sexuality and drug use. One mother likened the book to ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" for kids. The school initially defended its decision to include the book in its curriculum. However, after several parents expressed concerns over having to explain masturbation and other mature themes to their 11-year-olds, the school ultimately decided to remove the book from the curriculum. In a statement, the school acknowledged the concerns of parents while also expressing its commitment to offering a diverse range of literature to its students. ""While we believe that 'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' is an important work of literature that offers valuable insights into the experiences of Indigenous youth, we also understand that some parents may not feel comfortable with its content,"" the statement read. The incident has brought up larger questions about censorship and the role of parents in shaping their children's education. Some educators argue that exposing students to controversial or uncomfortable topics is an important part of their development, prompting them to think critically about the world around them. Others, however, feel that parents should have more control over what their children are exposed to in the classroom. In an interview with local news outlet WCBS, one concerned parent said, ""I think parents should have the right to decide what their children should be reading. That's our job as parents."" The debate over the appropriateness of ""The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian"" serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by educators in creating a curriculum that is both engaging and appropriate for all students. While schools must strive to expose students to a diverse range of perspectives and experiences, they must also be mindful of the concerns of parents and the sensitivities of their students. Ultimately, the decision to include any particular book in a school's curriculum must be a thoughtful and nuanced one, taking into account both the literary merits of the work and the potential impact it may have on students and their families.","(458, 16)","By.

A school in New York has been forced to back down after parents complained about an 11-year-old boy being asked to read a book about masturbation.
Parents objected to their children reading Sherman Alexie's ""The Absolutely True Diary Of A Part-Time Indian"", which includes a scene where the main character masturbates.
One concerned mom likened it to ""Fifty Shades Of Grey"" for kids and said she didn't want to have to explain it to her 11-year-old son.
The school in Queens, N.Y., backed down after receiving complaints from parents who said they didn't want their 11-year-old children to read about masturbation.
The book, written by Sherman Alexie and published in 2007, won the National Book Award for Young People's Literature.
It tells the story of Arnold Spirit Jr., a Native American teenager growing up on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Wellpinit, Washington.
Arnold, who goes by Junior, suffers from hydrocephalus, a condition that causes fluid to build up in the brain.
His mother dies when he is young, and he is raised by his alcoholic father, who abuses him physically and emotionally.
Junior eventually leaves the reservation to attend an all-white high school in Reardan, Washington, where he excels academically and athletically.
Along the way, he deals with issues such as racism, poverty, and alcoholism.
The book has been praised for its honest portrayal of Native American life and its themes of resilience and hope.
However, it has also been criticized for its use of profanity and sexual content, including a scene where Junior masturbates.
Some parents have argued that the book is inappropriate for young readers and that it should not be taught in schools.
Others have defended the book, saying that it is an important work of literature that can help students understand the experiences of Native Americans and other marginalized groups.
The controversy over the book highlights the ongoing debate over what books should be included in school curriculums.
Some argue that schools should focus on teaching traditional subjects like math and science, while others believe that literature and other forms of creative expression are essential for a well-rounded education.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to teach a particular book in school should be based on a careful consideration of its content and its potential impact on students.
In this case, it seems that the school in Queens made the right decision by listening to the concerns of parents and removing the book from the curriculum.
While it is important to expose students to a wide range of ideas and perspectives, it is also important to ensure that they are not exposed to material that is inappropriate or harmful.
By making this decision, the school has shown that it is committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all students.","(537, 23)",,

Trial: Mark Bridger, the man accused of the murder of April Jones, arrives at Mold Crown Court as the jury retired to consider its verdicts today . A jury has retired to begin its deliberations in the trial of the man accused of murdering April Jones. Mark Bridger, 47, is accused at Mold Crown Court of snatching and murdering the five-year-old in a 'sexually motivated' attack. Bridger, a former slaughterhouse worker from Ceinws, denies abduction, murder and intending to pervert the course of justice. He claims he killed April when he accidentally 'crushed' her with his Land Rover but cannot remember what he did with the body because he was drunk and panicking. Today the jury of nine women and three men was asked to begin its deliberations after a month long trial and were told to take 'all the time they need', the judge told them. In her closing speech to the jury yesterday, Elwen Evans QC, prosecuting, said: 'The evidence overwhelmingly compels the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of each count in this case.' Beginning his address, Brendan Kelly QC, defending, urged the jury to put aside the 'obvious emotions' attached to the case and decide their verdict on the evidence. Claims: Mark Bridger, 47, claims that he hit April Jones, 5, with his car and cannot remember what happened to her body . He said: 'Mark Bridger denies these offences, he denies the inferences which you have been invited to draw, he challenges the 'compelling' evidence which the Crown advances, he says he is not guilty of these offences.' Beginning his summing up, trial judge Mr Justice Griffith Williams gave the jury legal directions and urged them to conduct a 'dispassionate review of the evidence.' April disappeared as she was playing with a friend near their homes on the Bryn-y-Gog estate, Machynlleth, Powys, on October 1 last year. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","(399, 20)","Mark Bridger, who is currently serving a life sentence for the abduction and murder of 5-year-old April Jones in October 2012, has denied the charges brought against him. In his court appearances, Bridger has consistently maintained his innocence, and his latest statement to the court was no exception. Bridger claims that he had never met or had any contact with April Jones, and had nothing to do with her disappearance. The trial, which lasted for four weeks in Mold Crown Court, was highly publicized, and the jury took just over four hours to find Bridger guilty of the charges of abduction, murder, and perverting the course of justice. During the trial, Bridger had tried to explain away his DNA being found on April Jones' clothes by claiming that he must have accidentally brushed against her while walking past her on the street. The court, however, rejected his explanation, saying that it was unlikely that his DNA would have ended up on her clothes in such a way. The police investigation into April Jones' disappearance and her subsequent murder was one of the most extensive in recent British history. It involved over 200 police officers and other experts, and more than 3,000 statements were taken. The case received worldwide media attention, and it touched the hearts of millions of people around the world. The judge in the case, Mr Justice Griffith Williams, said that Bridger's denials were ""utterly without any foundation,"" and that he had shown no remorse for his actions. Bridger was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 35 years. The case of April Jones is a tragic example of the worst sort of crime that can be committed against a child. It is also an example of how the police, the courts, and the media can work together to bring a killer to justice. While Bridger continues to deny his guilt, the fact remains that he was found guilty by a jury of his peers, and justice has been served. April Jones will never be forgotten, and her legacy will live on in the memories of those who loved her.","(400, 15)","By. Martin Robinson. PUBLISHED:. 08:15 EST, 29 May 2013. |.

A 33-year-old man who held a sign up on a Texas road warning of a police speed trap has been defending his actions in court. Ron Martin was arrested in October after an officer spotted him in the median of Eldorado Parkway in Frisco, with a sign that read: 'Police ahead'. The officers were alerted to Martin's presence when drivers started to wave at them as they drove past the speed trap. In court on Wednesday, Martin said he held up the sign because he was worried for the safety of the traffic police. Martin said he had filed several complaints about what he believed were unsafe practices of the traffic officers on the busy stretch of highway. 'They hide behind signs and they use . their motorcycles sitting in the road, sun going down, without lights or . anything,' Martin, a sign painter, told Fox News. 'I just feel like it was a little bit unsafe, not only for citizens, but for police officers having to do their job.' Texas police said they had spotted Martin holding a sign on the same stretch of road on two other occasions. On the day of Martin's arrest, Officer Thomas Mrozinski wrote in his report: 'I observed a couple cars drive by traveling westbound waving at us.' The officer accused Martin of trying to interfere with speed enforcement. But in court Martin likened himself to the traffic police, saying: 'Ultimately, weâ€™re trying to do the . exact same thing.

He added: Iâ€™m the same thing as a speed limit sign, just reminding people that . there is a limit here.' Martin has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor sign for holding a homemade sign.

In an effort to promote transparency and accountability, the state has allowed citizens to put up signs warning drivers about police presence. However, these signs must be on private property, and Martin worries about the safety of traffic officers who rely on the element of surprise. Martin's concerns stem from his experience as a police officer. He knows that traffic stops can be dangerous for both officers and drivers, and that the element of surprise can sometimes protect both parties. He worries that if drivers become accustomed to seeing warning signs, they may become more aggressive or unpredictable, putting both themselves and police officers in danger. ""I understand the desire for transparency and accountability,"" Martin said in a recent interview. ""But we have to balance that with the safety of our officers. If drivers know exactly where they might encounter a police officer, they may try to avoid that area, or they may be more likely to take risks."" Martin is not alone in his concerns. Many police unions and associations across the country have spoken out against similar signage laws, arguing that they put officers in danger. Some states, like Florida, have even gone so far as to outlaw such signs on public property entirely. Proponents of the Texas law argue that it is an important step towards building trust between law enforcement and the community. They say that by informing citizens about police presence, they can reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings and conflicts. However, Martin worries that the potential benefits are outweighed by the potential costs. He says that ultimately, the safety of police officers has to be the top priority.

Texas allows warning signs about police but they have to be on private property
A Texas man has been arrested for putting up a sign warning drivers about speed traps in his neighborhood.
Ron Martin, 52, was charged with tampering with a governmental record after he put up a sign that read: 'Speed trap ahead. Beware of cops.'
Martin said he put up the sign because he was concerned about the safety of the traffic officers who work in the area.
He told KTRK-TV: 'I was concerned for their safety. I didn't want them to get hurt. I wanted them to be aware of what was going on around them.'
The sign was placed on a utility pole in front of Martin's home in the Houston suburb of Humble.
Texas law allows people to put up warning signs about speed traps as long as they are on private property.
But Martin's sign was on a utility pole, which is considered public property.
Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Ron Hickman said Martin's sign was illegal because it was on public property.
He said: 'If you're going to put up a sign, put it on your own property. Don't put it on somebody else's property.'
Hickman said Martin could face up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine if he is convicted of tampering with a government record.
Martin said he plans to fight the charges against him.
He told KPRC-TV: 'I don't think I did anything wrong. I don't think I broke any laws.'

Spain defender Sergio Ramos is refusing to wallow in the pain of Friday’s 5-1 drubbing
","Spain defender Sergio Ramos is refusing to wallow in the pain of Friday’s 5-1 drubbing by Holland and will use it instead as a motivation for their next game. The world champions cannot afford to lose against Chile at the Maracana on Wednesday and Ramos insists their Dutch horror show will help them. ‘I’m not going to spend another second thinking about that match,’ said the Real Madrid defender, who was given the runaround by Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben.

Is that wheelie appropriate? Sergio Ramos appears to take a break from training and ride his bike . ‘This team has experience and has been through bad times. It has been able to come back from setbacks like this. That makes it great.’ One setback was losing against Switzerland in their first game at the 2010 World Cup, a tournament they went on to win. With Chile beating Australia in their first game, the pressure is on Spain again and Fernando Torres accepts there is little room for error. Spanish inquisition: the defending world champions had plenty to ponder after defeat to Holland . Looking forward: Fernando Torres knows Spain can't afford to drop points against Chile on Wednesday . The Chelsea striker said: ‘Your opponents know you have to win. You can’t afford to draw and they’ll try to make the most of any anxiety we might have.’ Ramos dismissed suggestions that Spain were at a disadvantage against Holland because they had been training in the milder south for a match in steamy Salvador. ‘We are training here in good temperatures, in good conditions and with good facilities,’ he said. ‘If we’d won, you wouldn’t be talking about this subject.’ After his howler against Holland on Friday night, calls have grown in Spain for manager Vicentre Del Bosque to drop keeper Iker Casillas. The pair were spotted talking as Spain trained on Saturday and Casillas certainly didn't look happy after Del Bosque walked away (bottom).","(415, 19)","Spain's World Cup campaign got off to a disastrous start as they were thrashed 5-1 by Holland in their opening game on Friday. This defeat follows their loss at the 2010 World Cup, where they lost their first game against Switzerland. The reigning world champions found themselves a goal down within the first ten minutes of the game as Holland's Robin van Persie scored an impressive diving header. The Spanish team, however, managed to equalize soon after with a goal from Xabi Alonso from the penalty spot. Despite the draw, it was Holland who dominated the game, scoring four more goals in the second half. Arjen Robben scored twice and Stefan de Vrij and Wesley Sneijder both added their names to the scoresheet. The heavy defeat has put immense pressure on the Spanish team, who now face a must-win game against Chile on Wednesday. A loss in this game would see them crash out of the competition at the group stage, an unthinkable outcome for a side that had been tipped to go all the way. Fernando Torres, who started the Holland game on the bench, admitted after the match that Spain had been well beaten and that they now had to perform against Chile. ""We have no excuses,"" he said. ""We have a very important game against Chile now that we need to win."" Spain's coach, Vicente del Bosque, also acknowledged that his side had been outplayed by Holland. ""We were not at our best,"" he said. ""We made mistakes that we usually do not make and Holland took advantage of that."" The defeat also raises questions about the future of the Spanish team. Many of the players who helped Spain to win the World Cup in 2010 are now in their thirties, and some have suggested that it may be time to blood some younger players. The Spanish team will have to regroup quickly if they are to avoid an early exit from this year's World Cup. They know they will need to improve their performance if they are to stand a chance against a Chile team who will be looking to capitalize on Spain's poor performance against Holland.","(406, 18)","Spain defender Sergio Ramos is refusing to wallow in the pain of Friday’s 5-1 drubbing

Ramos, who scored an own goal in the 53rd minute to give the Dutch a 3-1 lead, said
the team was determined to bounce back when they face Chile on Wednesday.
“We have to keep our heads up,” Ramos said. “We have to forget about what happened
in the last game and focus on the next one. It’s going to be a very difficult game
against Chile, but we have to go out there and try to win.”
Spain coach Vicente del Bosque echoed Ramos’ sentiments, saying the team was
determined to put the loss behind them and focus on the task at hand.
“We have to learn from our mistakes and move on,” Del Bosque said. “We can’t dwell
on the past. We have to focus on the present and the future. We have a tough game
against Chile on Wednesday, and we have to be ready for it.”
The loss to the Netherlands was a major setback for Spain, who were looking to
defend their World Cup title. However, Del Bosque remains confident that his team
can turn things around and make a strong run in the tournament.
“We have a lot of talented players on this team, and we have shown in the past that
we can compete with the best teams in the world,” he said. “We are not going to let
this loss define us. We are going to use it as motivation to work even harder and
come back stronger in the next game.”
Ramos, who has been a key member of the Spanish national team for many years, said
he was disappointed with his own performance in the loss to the Netherlands.
“I made a mistake that cost us a goal, and I take full responsibility for it,” he
said. “But I am not going to dwell on it. I am going to learn from it and move on.
We have a lot of games left in this tournament, and we are going to do everything
we can to make sure we come out on top.”
Del Bosque said he was proud of the way his team fought back in the second half
against the Netherlands, scoring two goals to make the final score 5-3.
“We showed a lot of heart and determination in the second half, and I am proud of
the way my players responded to the challenge,” he said.
However, Del Bosque acknowledged that the team still has a lot of work to do if
they want to advance to the knockout stage of the tournament.
“We know we have to play better than we did against the Netherlands if we want to
win our next game against Chile,” he said.
Ramos said he was looking forward to the challenge of playing against Chile, a
team that has proven to be a tough opponent in the past.
“Chile is a very good team, and they will be coming into this game with a lot of
confidence after beating Australia in their opening match,” he said.

Banksy's latest creation in New York is an open-air gallery featuring two pieces on canvas
","Banksy's latest creation in New York is an open-air gallery featuring two pieces on canvas hanging under the High Line in Chelsea. The pieces appear to be a collaboration between Banksy and Brazilian twins, Os Gemeos. Banksy reportedly paid the owner of the space $50,000 to hang his two paintings under the overpass on West 24th between 10th and 11th Avenues. Under guard: Banksy unveiled his latest artwork in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York as part of 'Better Out Than In' Best behavior: Banksy's guards imposed strict rules on crowds eager to view and photograph the works . It's the latest installment of 'Better Out Than In,' Banksy's month-long 'residency' in New York City. The artist announced the works himself on his website. 'Are you the sort of person who enjoys going to art galleries, but wished they had more gravel in them? Then this temporary exhibition space is for you. Housing just two paintings but also featuring a bench, some carpet and complimentary refreshments. Opens today through Sunday 11am til midnight,' he wrote. Refreshments is probably overstating it a little, unless you're in the market for some yellow liquid, reportedly non-alcoholic white wine, dispensed through a water cooler. Chelsea opening: In an area known for swanky galleries, Banksy offered a water cooler filled with white non-alcoholic wine for attendees . Collaboration: Brit Banksy created the works with Brazilian artist Os Gemeos . The New York Post reports that guards watching over the paintings gave onlookers strict instructions for viewing the works. 'This is a private exhibit. There is zero tolerance. If you act up, we will close the gates and that’s that,' said a guard. Needs more gravel: Banksy's latest unveiling drew large crowds to a make-shift outdoor gallery . Catching a glimpse: The works drew crowds of New Yorkers on Saturday . 'You guys come in  small groups . You get five minutes and then we rotate. Everybody gets a fair chance to go in and see the piece. No alcohol no dogs and if you guys behave yourselves we’ll be good to go,' onlookers were told. According to Gothamist, the space is owned by New York property developer Alf Naman. Banksy has caused quite a stir in the Big Apple, where he's undertaking a month-long self-imposed residency. New Yorkers wake every morning to discover a new work adorning some corner of the city. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said last week that graffiti ruins property and is 'a sign of decay,' but  said the NYPD is not actively searching for the artful artist.","(487, 27)","The world-renowned street artist Banksy has once again managed to captivate his audience with his latest guerrilla art show. This time, the elusive artist has set up an outdoor gallery complete with refreshments and 24-hour security guards. According to reports, Banksy paid the owner of the space a whopping $50,000 to showcase his works there. The location of the exhibit is currently unknown, but rumors suggest that it may be somewhere in the United States. The gallery features a series of Banksy's signature thought-provoking pieces, including a politically charged mural and a sculpture made entirely out of recycled materials. Attendees are allowed to enter the space in groups of 20, with each group being permitted to stay for a limited amount of time before they have to leave. The exhibit has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Some have hailed it as another brilliant Banksy creation, while others have criticized it as a cheap ploy for publicity. Regardless of the criticism, one thing is certain - Banksy's art continues to provoke and inspire. The outdoor gallery comes hot on the heels of the artist's recent controversial decision to shred one of his most iconic pieces - ""Girl With Balloon"" - during a live auction. The artwork was sold for over $1 million, but just as the hammer came down, the painting began to self-destruct, leaving the art world stunned. Banksy's latest exhibition is another reminder of the artist's elusive nature. Despite his immense popularity and influence, no one knows who Banksy really is, adding to the intrigue and fascination that surrounds him. The exhibit has also been a subject of controversy due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Some have criticized the event for encouraging mass gatherings and flouting social distancing guidelines. However, it's worth noting that the gallery is being closely monitored by security guards to ensure that attendees follow proper safety protocols. All in all, Banksy's latest exhibition is another stroke of genius from the elusive artist. Whether you love or hate his work, there's no denying that Banksy continues to push boundaries and challenge the norms of the art world.","(399, 18)","Banksy's latest creation in New York is an open-air gallery featuring two pieces on canvas
Banksy, the world-renowned street artist, has once again left his mark on the streets of New York City. His latest creation, an open-air gallery, has been causing quite a stir among art enthusiasts and passersby alike. The gallery, which features two pieces on canvas, is located in a vacant lot in the heart of the city and is open to the public 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
The first piece, titled ""Girl with Balloon,"" depicts a young girl holding a balloon that appears to be deflating. The second piece, titled ""Flower Thrower,"" shows a man throwing a bouquet of flowers at a wall. Both pieces are painted in Banksy's signature style, which is characterized by bold colors, intricate details, and a sense of humor.
What makes this exhibition unique is that it is completely free to the public. Visitors can come and go as they please, and there is no need to make reservations or purchase tickets. This accessibility has made the gallery a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, with people lining up around the block to get a glimpse of Banksy's work.
In addition to the two main pieces, the gallery also features a number of smaller works by Banksy and other street artists. These include graffiti tags, stencils, and murals, all of which add to the overall atmosphere of the space.
The location of the gallery is also significant. It is situated in an area of the city that is known for its street art and graffiti, making it a natural fit for Banksy's work. The surrounding neighborhood is also home to a number of galleries, museums, and other cultural institutions, making it a hub for art and creativity.
Overall, Banksy's open-air gallery in New York is a testament to the power of street art and the impact it can have on a community. By making his work accessible to the public, Banksy has created a space where people can come together to appreciate art and connect with one another. It is a reminder that art can be found in unexpected places and that creativity knows no bounds.","(422, 17)",,

Husband charged: Jerry Canfield, 72, is accused of shooting his wife of 37 years, Joann
","Husband charged: Jerry Canfield, 72, is accused of shooting his wife of 37 years, Joann Canfield, in the head at her own request . A 72-year-old Northern California man has been charged with murder for what his attorney says was the mercy killing of his dementia-stricken wife. Jerry ‘JC’ Canfield, of Alameda, was arraigned last week on a murder charge in the shooting death of his wife of 37 years, Joann Canfield. Police say Canfield walked into the Alameda police station October 26 to confess that he killed his 72-year-old wife by shooting her in the head. He allegedly told investigators the two had previously agreed he would end her life if an illness left her in constant pain. Assistant Public Defender Drew Steckler said police found physical evidence at the crime scene that corroborated what Canfield told them, including that he left a dozen red roses at his wife's bedside. Mr Canfield is being held in jail without bail. He is scheduled to appear in court to enter a plea November 14. The couple's neighbors in Alameda have spoken out in Canfield's defense, saying that the couple had been inseparable. 'You know, you've heard of being in love? Well, they were that,' next door neighbor Jose De Dios told ABC 7 News. Scroll down for video . Touching gesture: Joann Canfield was found dead from a gunshot wound in her bed, flanked by a dozen red roses left there by her husband . Another neighbor, Bridget Milet, also confirmed that the couple were as close as two people can possibly be. ‘Whenever I'd see them, it restored my faith in married people,’ Milet told KTVU. ‘They just loved each other.’ The 72-year-old woman had developed dementia and her condition was rapidly deteriorating. De Dios said Jerry Canfield once told him that his wife was seeing little demons that were chasing her around the house, causing her to trip and fall often. A month ago, Mr Canfield was forced to put her in a nursing home, but his neighbor said he would spend every waking moment by her side. Memorial: Neighbors have been bringing flowers and other mementos to the Canfields' apartment in Alameda . On October 25, a day before the shooting, the husband brought Joann Canfield back home. Local residents recalled seeing the woman looking disoriented and unable to recognize anyone. The following day, the 72-year-old man placed a bouquet of roses next to his wife's bed and shot her in the head to end her pain, as the two had agreed in advance, according to an affidavit. Canfield then dressed up and drove down to the Alameda police station, where he told an officer that he wanted to make a confession.","(516, 23)","Jerry Canfield, a 72-year-old man from Alameda, California, has been charged with murder for the shooting death of his wife of 37 years, Joann Canfield. The incident took place on October 26th, when Mr. Canfield allegedly shot his wife in the head in what his attorney is calling a ""mercy killing"". According to reports, Mr. Canfield confessed to the killing shortly after it occurred, telling police that he had promised his wife that he would end her pain if it became unbearable for her. It is unclear what type of pain Mrs. Canfield was suffering from, though reports indicate that she had been in poor health for some time. The murder has sent shockwaves throughout the community, with many residents expressing disbelief that such a tragedy could occur in their peaceful town. Some have called for stricter gun laws, while others are calling for more support for those who are caring for loved ones who are sick or in pain. Mr. Canfield's attorney, John Smith, has released a statement on behalf of his client, expressing regret for the incident but also defending his actions. ""Jerry Canfield loved his wife deeply, and he could not bear to see her suffering any longer,"" the statement reads. ""He made a promise to her that he would end her pain if it became too much for her to bear, and unfortunately he had to fulfill that promise."" Despite the defense's arguments, local law enforcement officials have emphasized that the shooting was a clear violation of the law, and that Mr. Canfield will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. ""No one is above the law, and we will not tolerate this kind of violence in our community,"" said Alameda Police Chief Mark Nisleit. The Canfields were known by many in the community as a loving and devoted couple, with friends describing them as ""an inspiration to us all"". They were active in local causes and were often seen at community events, and their loss has been deeply felt by many. While the investigation into the murder is ongoing, many are left wondering how such a tragic event could occur. Some are calling for greater awareness of the mental and emotional tolls of caregiving, while others are questioning the adequacy of support services for those who are struggling with end-of-life issues. Despite the tragedy, many in the community are coming together to support each other in the wake of this loss. Vigils have been held in memory of Joann Canfield, and local authorities are encouraging anyone who may need support to seek it out. ""We are here for you,"" said Chief Nisleit. ""We will do everything we can to support those who have been affected by this tragedy.""","(517, 19)","Husband charged: Jerry Canfield, 72, is accused of shooting his wife of 37 years, Joann
Jerry Canfield, a 72-year-old man from Alameda, California has been charged with the murder of his wife, Joann. The incident took place on October 26th, when Canfield confessed to the police that he had shot his wife in the head. According to Canfield's attorney, the shooting was a ""mercy killing"" and was done out of love and compassion for his wife, who was suffering from an incurable illness.
Canfield, who has been married to Joann for 37 years, told police that he had made a promise to his wife that he would end her suffering if it became unbearable. Joann, who was 71 years old at the time of her death, had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and was in constant pain. Canfield said that he could no longer watch his wife suffer and decided to take matters into his own hands.
The shooting took place in the couple's home in Alameda, and Canfield immediately called the police after the incident. He was arrested and charged with murder, but his attorney has argued that the shooting was a mercy killing and that Canfield should not be held responsible for his actions.
The case has sparked a debate about the legality of mercy killings and the rights of terminally ill patients to end their own lives. Some argue that Canfield should be commended for his act of love and compassion, while others believe that he should be held accountable for his actions.
Joann's family has released a statement saying that they are heartbroken by the loss of their loved one, but that they understand the difficult decision that Canfield had to make. They have asked for privacy during this difficult time and have expressed their support for Canfield and his family.
The case is currently being investigated by the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, and a decision on whether to prosecute Canfield will be made in the coming weeks. In the meantime, Canfield remains in custody and is awaiting trial.","(385, 14)",,

One in five men in Britain die from a heart attack compared to just one
","One in five men in Britain die from a heart attack compared to just one in seven women . By . Sophie Borland . UPDATED: . 05:39 EST, 12 August 2011 . Around one in five men in Britain die from a heart attack, compared to just one in seven women . The sex hormone oestrogen protects women from heart attacks and may explain why they are far less likely to be struck down than men, claim scientists. They have discovered that this naturally-occurring chemical helps stop blood cells sticking to the walls of arteries and forming potentially fatal blockages. Researchers from Queen Mary at the University of London think their findings  may explain why women are far more likely to suffer heart attacks after the menopause, when their oestrogen levels decline. Around one in five men in Britain die from a heart attack, compared to just one in seven women. But while very few women suffer heart attacks before their 50s, the risk suddenly increases after the menopause when they are just as likely to be struck down than men. Until recently experts have struggled to explain why younger women are less likely to develop heart disease and suffer heart attacks. Now research published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology claims that the hormone oestrogen may protect them. But experts say their findings do not necessarily mean that oestrogen could  ever be used in drugs to prevent heart disease. The hormone is known to increase the risk of certain types of cancer. Dr Suchita Nadkarni from the William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary,  University of London, who led the research, said: 'We’ve shown a clear relationship between oestrogen levels and the behaviour of these white blood cells. Researchers from Queen Mary at the University of London, pictured, think their findings may explain why women are far more likely to suffer heart attacks after the menopause, when their oestrogen levels decline . 'Our results suggest that oestrogen helps maintain the delicate balance between fighting infections, and protecting arteries from damage that can lead to cardiovascular disease. 'Understanding how the body fights heart disease naturally is vital for  developing new treatments.' Professor Jeremy Pearson, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart  Foundation said: 'We know that women’s health is partly protected by oestrogen. After menopause  – when oestrogen levels drop dramatically – coronary heart disease rates rise  steeply. It’s not yet clear quite how this protection occurs. 'This study suggests that oestrogen has another role. The hormone seems to  affect women’s response to infection and injury, by preventing white blood  cells from moving out of the blood stream into tissues. This reduces  inflammation, part of the immune system’s rapid response.'","(502, 25)","A recent study has found that the male sex hormone, testosterone, may play a crucial role in preventing artery blockages and reducing the likelihood of heart attacks in men. According to statistics, one in five men in Britain die from a heart attack, compared to just one in seven women. This makes heart disease the leading cause of death among men in the country. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, examined the role of testosterone in preventing blood cells from sticking to artery walls and forming blockages, which can lead to heart attacks. The researchers found that testosterone helps to regulate the production of a protein called PCSK9, which is known to play a key role in the buildup of plaque in the arteries. The study's lead author, Dr. Dobromir Dobrev, explained that ""the findings suggest that testosterone may help to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of heart disease and heart attacks in men."" The research team conducted experiments on mice that were genetically engineered to lack the Pcsk9 gene. They found that the mice had lower levels of plaque buildup in their arteries compared to normal mice. The researchers then injected the mice with testosterone and found that it further reduced plaque buildup in the arteries. Dr. Dobrev acknowledged that more research is needed to fully understand the implications of the findings. However, he expressed that the study provides new insights into the role of testosterone in cardiovascular health, especially for men who are at increased risk of heart disease. Heart disease is a major public health concern in the UK, with over 7.4 million people living with the condition. Men are more likely to develop heart disease at a younger age than women, and research has shown that testosterone levels may have a significant impact on heart health. The new findings are likely to lead to further research exploring the potential benefits of testosterone replacement therapy in men with low testosterone levels. This treatment is already used to improve symptoms of low testosterone, such as reduced sex drive, but it remains a controversial topic in terms of its effects on cardiovascular health. In conclusion, the latest research provides valuable insights into the role of testosterone in preventing artery blockages and reducing the risk of heart disease in men. While more research is needed to fully understand the implications of the findings, the study highlights the importance of testosterone regulation in cardiovascular health, especially for men who are at increased risk of heart attack. The new findings may pave the way for further research into testosterone replacement therapy, which could improve heart health outcomes in men with low testosterone levels.","(488, 18)","One in five men in Britain die from a heart attack compared to just one
in seven women. A new study has found that the sex hormone oestrogen
helps stop blood cells from sticking to artery walls, which can lead to
blockages. This discovery could pave the way for new treatments for
heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the UK.
The study, led by researchers at the University of Edinburgh, looked at
the effects of oestrogen on blood cells called platelets. Platelets play
a crucial role in blood clotting, but they can also cause problems when
they stick to the walls of arteries and form clots. This can lead to
heart attacks and strokes.
The researchers found that oestrogen helps to prevent platelets from
sticking to artery walls. They believe that this is because oestrogen
binds to receptors on the surface of platelets, which prevents them from
adhering to the artery wall.
This discovery could have important implications for the treatment of
heart disease. Currently, there are no drugs available that specifically
target platelets. However, if we can develop drugs that mimic the effects
of oestrogen on platelets, we may be able to reduce the risk of heart
attacks and strokes.
The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. It was
funded by the British Heart Foundation and the Medical Research Council.
The researchers hope that their findings will help to improve our
understanding of heart disease and lead to new treatments for this

","(CNN) -- Burned rubble near a Bali travel guidebook. Twisted metal beside brightly-colored suitcases. Headphones and human remains. In the rural area of eastern Ukraine where a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 fell from the sky on Thursday, the ground was scarred with death and devastation left behind by a flight that never reached its destination. Video footage from the site, located about 30 miles from the Russian border, showed smoke billowing from the smoldering wreckage long after the crash. ""It's a gruesome scene,"" freelance journalist Noah Sneider said. ""There's bodies splayed out through the fields. People said the plane kind of exploded in the air, and everything rained down in bits and pieces, the plane itself, the people inside."" Stunned rescue workers and rebel fighters combed the area, Sneider said, planting sticks with white cotton ribbons where they found bodies in the fields. There are so many dead that it's unlikely the local morgue will be able to hold them all, Sneider said, even in a volatile region that's seen waves of death recently amid clashes between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists. ""When there was the battle for the Donetsk airport, something like 50 people died and they didn't have the space,"" Sneider told CNN's Anderson Cooper. On this flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, officials say there were 298 people aboard. In the wide fields of tall grasses, debris stretched so far, in so many small pieces, that it seemed unfathomable that anyone would ever know for certain what happened to Flight 17, Sneider said. ""Finding things like passports,"" he said, ""is a matter of chance."" Separatists clearly controlled the site, Sneider said. But even battle-hardened rebel fighters appeared shocked, he said. Fighting has torn apart the region. But this is something else. ""Nothing of this scale has happened,"" said Sneider, who's been covering the conflict for months. Locals in the rural area trying to help were overwhelmed, he said. Firemen who rushed to put out the flames found they had a hose with holes in it, spraying water everywhere, he said. As night fell, search crews seemed uncertain about what to do at first, he said. But eventually, teams put up tents and set up flood lights in the field. Ukrainian officials said rescue and investigation teams had been hampered by armed groups in the area. Pictures suggested the area was hardly a cordoned off crime scene, with people standing on top of parts of the wrecked aircraft. And there are some reports that pieces of the aircraft have been looted and put in people's yards, CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Kiev. Sneider said he hadn't seen any looting by people in the area. ""Most of them are so frightened that they're not coming anywhere near here,"" he said.","(549, 28)","Tragedy struck on the outskirts of the war-torn city of Donetsk on Sunday evening, as a passenger plane crash-landed amidst ongoing violence in the region. The crash site is a harrowing scene of devastation, as charred debris fills a wide field with tall grass. Journalist Noah Sneider has described it as a ""gruesome scene"" and even battle-hardened Ukrainian rebels seem shaken by the severity of the crash. The plane, a Boeing 747, was traveling from Bangkok to Amsterdam with over 300 passengers and crew members on board. It crashed just outside Donetsk, a key city in the ongoing conflict between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists. The cause of the crash is not yet known, but the ongoing violence in the region undoubtedly played a role. This catastrophe is yet another reminder of the deepening crisis in Ukraine, where violence has escalated in recent weeks. The city of Donetsk, which has become a battleground between government and rebel forces, has been hit hard by the fighting, leaving many residents in a state of constant fear. The crash has brought a new level of horror to the already dire situation. Journalists and local residents alike are struggling to come to terms with the scale of the tragedy. Speaking to reporters, one local resident said: ""I can't believe this is happening in my city. We've been through so much already and now this."" Emergency services are working to recover the bodies of the victims, but the process is slow and dangerous due to ongoing fighting in the area. Rebel forces have reportedly prevented Ukrainian officials from gaining access to the crash site, adding to the tension in the region. As the investigation into the cause of the crash continues, questions are being raised about the safety of air travel in the conflict zone. Many airlines have already canceled flights to and from Ukraine, citing concerns over safety. The crash is a tragic reminder of the toll that the ongoing conflict is taking on the people of Ukraine. The country has been in turmoil since the ousting of former President Viktor Yanukovych in February, and the situation has only deteriorated since then. More than 3,000 people have been killed and nearly one million have been displaced since the conflict began. International leaders have condemned the violence and called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, but so far, their efforts have yielded little progress. The crash of Flight 747 is a stark reminder of the need for immediate action to end the conflict and restore stability to the region. As the world mourns the loss of those on board Flight 747, the crisis in Ukraine continues to deepen. The crash is a stark reminder that the people of Ukraine are caught in the middle of a bloody conflict that shows no signs of abating. The world must come together to find a way to bring an end to this tragedy and ensure that such a catastrophe does not happen again.","(547, 24)","(CNN) -- Burned rubble near a Bali travel guidebook.

Ukraine on Thursday.
Even battle-hardened Ukrainian rebel fighters seem stunned by the devastation, Sneider says. ""They're
shocked by what they're seeing,"" he says. ""They've seen a lot of death, but this is something else.""
Sneider, who has covered the conflict in eastern Ukraine for The New York Times, spoke to CNN by phone
from the village of Grabovo, where the Boeing 777 went down. He says the wreckage is spread out over a
wide field with tall grass. ""There's a lot of charred debris,"" he said. ""It's hard to make sense of what you're

left of the plane. It's just a field full of debris.""
Sneider says the area is controlled by pro-Russian separatists, who have been fighting Ukrainian government
forces in the region for months. He says the rebels have set up a makeshift command post near the crash
site. ""They're trying to figure out what to do next,"" he said.
Sneider says the rebels are allowing journalists to visit the crash site, but they are not allowing anyone to
enter the area where the plane went down. ""They're not letting anyone get close to the wreckage,"" he said.
""They're saying it's too dangerous. They're saying there are still unexploded ordnance in the area.""
Sneider says he does not know how many people were on board the plane when it crashed. He says the
rebels have not released any information about the passengers or crew. ""We don't know anything about
who was on the plane,"" he said.
CNN has reached out to the rebels for comment, but has not yet received a response.
Sneider says he will continue to cover the story from the crash site. ""I'm going to stay here as long as I can,""
he said. ""I want to see this through to the end.""

Manchester United are planning to play in a series of money-spinning friendlies across the world
","Manchester United are planning to play in a series of money-spinning friendlies across the world should they fail to qualify for Europe. The club is braced for a whopping £20million shortfall if they miss out on the Champions League for the first time in 19 years. And if David Moyes - who has had a disastrous first season at the Old Trafford helm - fails to steer the club into the Europa League, the club are set to miss out on a further £5m. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David Moyes react to the defeat to Olympiacos . Painful viewing: David Moyes has endured a terrible start to life at the Old Trafford helm, with his tenure reaching a nadir with a 2-0 defeat to Olympiacos in the Champions League . Down in the dumps: Nemanja Vidic, Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Robin van Persie and Tom Cleverley lookj dumbfounded during defeat in Greece . And the Old Trafford hierarchy will use globe-trotting, glamour friendlies to fill weeks previously dedicated to European nights to make up the shortfall. With the club set to rake in more than £12m from a five-game tour of the USA in summer, there is money to be made in developing markets such as the Middle East, America and India. And with fellow giants AC Milan, PSV Eindhoven, Valencia and Lyon also struggling in their domestic leagues, Wayne Rooney - who recently signed a £300,000-a-week deal - and Co could yet be set for regular trips abroad.

Developing market: Shinji Kagawa applauds fans during a friendly at Yokohama last summer .","(473, 21)","Manchester United is reportedly planning a series of high-profile, big-money friendlies around the world in the likely event of missing out on European qualification. The club stands to lose a whopping £20m if they fail to make it to the Champions League next season, a major hit that the team's top brass is preemptively trying to counteract with an aggressive global outreach. The plan, according to sources close to the club, is to organize exhibition matches in various parts of the world, aimed at boosting the club's global brand and attracting new fans. The United hierarchy believes that there is significant untapped potential in several key markets, including the Middle East, America, and India. Manchester United has long been one of the world's most popular and successful football clubs, with a global fan base that extends far beyond its home country of England. However, despite the team's longstanding popularity, there is still more work to be done in terms of reaching new fans and building the club's brand in developing markets. One potential avenue for growth that the club is reportedly exploring is the Middle East, where high-profile soccer exhibitions featuring top European teams have proven highly successful in the past. Manchester United was paid a reported £2m for playing a friendly in Saudi Arabia back in January 2008, an early indication of the financial potential of regionally-targeted exhibition matches. Another market that the club is keen to explore is America, where soccer's popularity has been steadily growing in recent years. Manchester United has made several trips to the United States in the past, playing in major cities like New York and Chicago in exhibition matches that drew large crowds and generated significant buzz. India, with its massive population and burgeoning middle class, is also seen as a potential growth market for Manchester United. While football has yet to achieve the same level of popularity in India as it has in other parts of the world, the country's growing youth soccer scene and increasing fan interest make it a potentially lucrative terrain for the club to explore. Of course, while the potential financial benefits of these exhibition matches are significant, there are certainly risks involved as well. Organizing such extensive tours involves significant travel and logistical challenges, and there is always the possibility that the team could suffer injuries or other setbacks during the matches themselves. Nevertheless, for Manchester United, the benefits of a successful global outreach program far outweigh the potential risks. With £20m at stake in terms of lost Champions League revenue, the club's top executives are doubling down on their efforts to reach new fans and build their brand around the world. Expect to see Manchester United playing exhibition matches in some surprising new markets in the years to come - win or lose in Europe.","(518, 17)","Manchester United are planning to play in a series of money-spinning friendlies across the world

(CNN) -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson signaled his intention to stay at the English
","(CNN) -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson signaled his intention to stay at the English Premier League champions for at least three more years but struggling Blackburn wrecked his 70th birthday celebrations with a stunning 3-2 win at Old Trafford Saturday. Ferguson marked 25 years in charge of the English Premier League champions earlier this year, but his ambition clearly still burns bright. ""I think I've got three years at the club,"" Ferguson told the official club website. ""As long as my health stays up, and as long as I'm still enjoying it and still getting the satisfaction of the team doing its best,"" he added. Ferguson's top moments in 25 years in charge . The legendary Scot has set his sights on further success in the European Champions League after their shock exit at the group stages this season and to add to the club's tally of 19 English championships. ""We have to continue the dominance of winning leagues and, without question, winning a European Cup is important at this club. We should have been in at least another three finals. But you can't be greedy, I suppose, and having won two in my time is an achievement. ""They were special, it was terrific to win them. I think I'd be very keen to do that (again)."" Blackburn, in the relegation zone of the EPL and with manager Steve Kean under continued pressure, scored probably the most unlikely win of the season after the United faithful had paid homage to their manager before the start. Blog: Out with the old and in with the new in 2012 . With Ferguson resting Wayne Rooney and other first team regulars, their Lancastrian neighbors led 1-0 at half time through an Ayegbeni Yakubu penalty. It was awarded after Dimitar Berbatov pulled down Christopher Samba and put away with some aplomb. Yakubu rifled home a super second, his 12th of the season just after the break, holding off Phil Jones and Michael Carrick before putting his side 2-0 ahead. Almost immediately, Berbatov atoned for his earlier mistake by pulling one back and when the Bulgarian equalized with his sixth goal in three games, United looked set to claim victory. But Kean's men were resolute throughout and in the 80th minute grabbed the winner. It came after United goalkeeper David de Gea flapped at a Morten Gamst Pedersen corner and Grant Hanley was on hand to head home. The result lifted Blackburn off the bottom, while United stayed level on points with neighbors Manchester City, who play Sunday against Sunderland. Ferguson did not temper his reaction to the disappointing defeat which prevented his side leading the EPL at the end of the year. ""It is a disaster,"" he told Press Association. ""I never expected it. We lost two terrible goals and you can't do that.""","(536, 24)","Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is not ready to hang up his boots just yet. The legendary manager, who recently celebrated 25 years in charge of the club, has revealed that he plans to stay on for at least another three years. Ferguson, who turned 70 on the same day that his team suffered a shock 3-2 defeat to Blackburn, has been at the helm of Manchester United since 1986. During his time with the club, he has won an unprecedented 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups, and 2 UEFA Champions League titles. Despite his age, Ferguson remains as committed as ever to his job. In a recent interview, he stated that he was in good health and that he had no plans to retire any time soon. ""I still feel young and energetic,"" he said. ""I enjoy the job, and I love seeing the team succeed. As long as I'm still capable of doing it, I'll continue to do it."" Ferguson's announcement comes at a time when Manchester United are level on points with arch-rivals Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table. The shock defeat to Blackburn, which came on the back of six consecutive wins for United, has put added pressure on the team to perform in the coming weeks. Despite the setback, Ferguson remains optimistic about his team's chances in the league this season. ""We've got a strong squad,"" he said. ""We've got some great players who are determined to win. It's going to be tough, but I believe we can do it."" Ferguson's commitment to Manchester United has earned him plaudits from across the football world.

Premier League club for at least another three years after celebrating his 25th anniversary in charge of the team.
Ferguson, who turned 70 last week, said he had no immediate plans to step down from the job he has held since November 1986.
""I think I've got another three years in me,"" he said. ""I don't see any reason why I can't do that.""
Ferguson's comments came after his team suffered a shock 3-2 defeat at home to Blackburn Rovers on Saturday, leaving them level on points with local rivals Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table.
It was the first time United had lost at home in the league this season, and the first time they had conceded three goals at Old Trafford since April 2009.
Ferguson said the defeat was a wake-up call for his players, who have been criticized for their lackluster performances in recent weeks.
""I think it was a reality check for us,"" he told reporters after the game. ""We haven't been playing well lately, and we need to get back to our best if we want to win the league.""
Ferguson took over as manager of United in November 1986, replacing Ron Atkinson, who had been sacked after a poor start to the season.
Since then, Ferguson has led United to 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups and two Champions League trophies.
He is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers in the history of English football, and his success at United has made him one of the most respected figures in the game.
Despite his age, Ferguson shows no signs of slowing down, and he remains determined to lead United to more success in the years to come.

(CNN) -- Jacqueline Woodson's big win at the National Book Awards on Wednesday was briefly
","(CNN) -- Jacqueline Woodson's big win at the National Book Awards on Wednesday was briefly eclipsed by a racially charged joke. After Woodson accepted an award for her memoir ""Brown Girl Dreaming,"" host Daniel Handler shared an anecdote he learned over the summer: that Woodson, who is black, is allergic to watermelon. ""Just let that sink in your mind,"" said Handler, who writes popular children's books under the pen name Lemony Snicket. The non sequitur elicited a few laughs and uncomfortable titters from the audience. Handler went on to say that he advised Woodson to write a book that featured a black girl with a watermelon allergy. Watermelon is historically evoked as a favorite food among black people in racist jokes, and it's considered by many to be an offensive reference. Handler said that Woodson, who won the National Book Award for Young People's Literature, told him he should write the book instead. ""I'm only writing a book about a black girl who is allergic to watermelon if I get a blurb from you, Cornell West, Toni Morrison, and Barack Obama saying this guy's OK,"" Handler said, with a laugh. After a clip from the awards ceremony was posed on C-SPAN, viewers and some prominent writers quickly took to Twitter to denounce Handler's comments as racist and a distraction from Woodson's accomplishment. Handler responded with several apologetic tweets, including: ""My remarks on Wednesday night at #NBAwards were monstrously inappropriate and yes, racist."" Handler also pledged to donate $10,000 to the We Need Diverse Books campaign and match others' donations for 24 hours up to $100,000. Woodson's post-ceremony social media posts have expressed her happiness about the award and have not mentioned Handler's joke. The author did not respond to a request for comment on the incident. Other 2014 National Book Award winners included: . Fiction: Phil Klay, ""Redeployment"" Nonfiction: Evan Osnos, ""Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China"" Poetry: Louise Gluck, ""Faithful and Virtuous Night""","(401, 15)","Jacqueline Woodson, the esteemed author of the memoir ""Brown Girl Dreaming,"" has been awarded the prestigious National Book Award for her work. However, the spotlight was soon stolen from her during the ceremony when ""Lemony Snicket"" author Daniel Handler made a controversial comment. During his presentation to Woodson, Handler recounted a story about a disagreement the pair had years ago about writing. In it, he requested that Woodson consider writing a story about a black girl who is allergic to watermelon. The comment was met with silence among the audience, and many quick to denounce it as both inappropriate and racist. The joke's offensiveness was not lost on Woodson, who addressed the comment afterwards in an interview. She expressed disappointment in Handler's lack of judgement, stating, ""It was so stunning, there was sort of a space of time where I didn’t say anything. I just looked at him, and he looked at me. I said nothing. I mean, really? To come up with that just felt like a slap in the face to me and to so many people."" Handler later apologized multiple times on Twitter for his words, stating, ""My apologies to @JackieWoodson - I am sorry for my flippant comment."" Woodson graciously accepted his apology, saying she ""appreciated his willingness to take full responsibility for the offense."" But for many, the incident highlighted the difficulties and prejudices still present in the literary world. As author Roxane Gay expressed on Twitter, ""What a painful metaphor for @JackieWoodson to experience. We cannot help the baggage others attach to our bodies."" Despite the unfortunate incident, Woodson's award win remained a much-deserved celebration of her talent and her memoir, which explores her experiences growing up in the 60s and 70s as a black child in America.

present her with the medal. But instead of congratulating Woodson, he
joked that he had once told her to write a book about ""a black girl

audience, but Handler went on to praise Woodson's work before
apologizing for the remark. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""That was in poor
taste. It was an attempt at humor. It wasn't. It didn't land. I'm very
sorry. That was not my intent.""

A grief-stricken couple have been banned from installing a plaque in memory of their daughter
","A grief-stricken couple have been banned from installing a plaque in memory of their daughter - after a council said such tributes were 'too depressing' to read. Tony and Julie Fuller, of Sunbury in Surrey planted a tree in Cedars Park after their only daughter Samantha died on Christmas Eve, aged 28. They wanted to place a plaque with the tree but were left devastated after being told that Spelthorne Borough Council will no longer permit memorial plaques - because 'lots' of people had complained that they were depressing. Tony and Julie Fuller have planted a tree in Cedars Park, pictured, after their only daughter Samantha died on Christmas Eve, aged 28. But the local council has barred them from putting up a memorial plaque . Mr Fuller said: ‘Sam was our only daughter. She meant the world to me and she probably meant more to her mother. ‘You can’t even describe the idea of losing a child. You have to love them completely and make sure you hug them every day. ‘I rang to ask if we could have a tree and how we could go about it. ‘But we were told we couldn’t have a plaque as the council is no longer allowing them. 'I can’t see the harm in it, considering all the other plaques there are on trees and benches. 'I just don’t believe it. I don’t believe people can be so unhappy at seeing memorials. Samantha had contracted Wegener’s granulomatosis, a condition where the immune system attacks itself. The family wanted to create a lasting memory to her. But Jackie Taylor, head of Streetscene at the council, said: 'As a result of lots of complaints that we had, we decided we would stop allowing memorial plaques to remember people. 'At the end of the day our parks and open spaces are to be used by everybody and people don’t like that around every bench or tree there was another plaque remembering somebody who died. 'We don’t have an issue with somebody planting a tree but it doesn’t have to be there with a plaque. 'The trees are there for the people to remember for themselves and we have done the same now with memorial plaques on benches.'","(430, 20)","Sunbury, Surrey - The Spelthorne Borough Council has rejected the bid made by Tony and Julie Fuller for a memorial plaque in memory of their late daughter, Samantha. The council refused the request, stating that memorial plaques tend to be too depressing for people to read. Samantha, who was only 28 years old, passed away due to an immune system illness. Her parents decided to plant a tree in Cedars Park in memory of their daughter. As a tribute to Samantha, the Fullers also wanted to put up a memorial plaque in the same area. However, their request was turned down by the council. The Fullers were devastated by the decision and expressed their disappointment with the council's lack of empathy. In an interview with local reporters, Julie Fuller said, ""We were shocked and heartbroken when we heard the news. We just want to honor our daughter's memory and give something back to the community. It's a shame the council didn't see it that way."" Many people from the community have come forward to express their support for the Fullers. They believe that the council's decision was unfair and insensitive. The Fullers had hoped to put up a memorial plaque in a peaceful spot, which would help them remember their daughter and create a space for others to reflect and think. A spokesperson for Spelthorne Borough Council defended the decision by saying that it was made in the best interest of the public. The council believes that memorial plaques tend to be too upsetting for people visiting the park and that they would prefer a more positive outlook. While many people agree that Cedars Park is a serene spot, there are those who believe that the council is missing an opportunity to show empathy to grieving families in the area. The Fullers and the community have called for the council to reconsider their decision and think of ways to support families who are dealing with loss. In conclusion, the Fullers' request for a memorial plaque in memory of their daughter has been turned down by the Spelthorne Borough Council. While the council cites reasons for their decision, many residents and the Fullers believe that the council has missed an opportunity to show empathy towards grieving families. The Fullers will continue to honor their daughter's memory through the tree they planted in Cedars Park.","(435, 20)","A grief-stricken couple have been banned from installing a plaque in memory of their daughter
Tony and Julie Fuller were devastated when their 28-year-old daughter Samantha died of an immune system illness in 2015.

But Spelthorne borough council rejected their request, saying it would be ""too depressing"" for people to read.

Mr Fuller said: ""We just want to be able to remember our daughter. We don't understand why the council won't let us do that.""
A council spokesman said: ""Memorial plaques are not permitted in any of our parks and open spaces.
""This is due to the fact that we receive many requests for memorial plaques, which would result in a large number of plaques being placed in the parks and open spaces across the borough.

The spokesman added: ""We appreciate that this is a difficult time for Mr and Mrs Fuller, but we hope they will understand that we have to consider the needs of all park and open space users when making decisions about the placement of memorial plaques.""
The couple have now launched a petition calling on the council to change its policy on memorial plaques.
So far, more than 1,000 people have signed the petition, which says: ""We believe that everyone should have the right to remember their loved ones in a way that is meaningful to them.
""We are asking the council to review its policy and allow memorial plaques to be placed in parks and open spaces.""","(481, 22)",,

This has sparked concern among local council officials who are responsible for safeguarding vulnerable children. According to sources close to the council, the family had been under their radar for some time. However, despite multiple interventions, including regular visits from social workers, the situation had not improved. As a result, the family's circumstances had come to the attention of the media and were widely reported. The council has defended its handling of the situation, stating that they did everything within their power to keep the family safe. They say that the family's difficult circumstances, which included poverty, addiction, and mental health issues, made it challenging to provide the necessary support. Many people in the community are concerned about what this case could mean for the wider issue of child protection. Some argue that the council should have done more to intervene and protect the children, while others sympathize with the difficult decisions that social workers must make. Dr. Sarah Wood, a child protection expert, believes that the case highlights the need for better training and support for social workers. ""Cases like this are incredibly challenging and often require a nuanced approach,"" she said. ""It's essential that social workers have access to the right resources and support so that they can make informed decisions that are in the best interests of the child."" The case has also raised wider questions about the state of child protection services in the UK. Many experts have warned that social services are overstretched and under-resourced, which makes it difficult for them to provide the necessary support to vulnerable families. Despite the challenges, the council says that it remains committed to protecting children and supporting families in need. It has put in place a range of new measures designed to improve safeguarding, including better training for social workers and more investment in child protection services. As for the family at the center of this case, their future remains uncertain. The council says that it will continue to work with them to provide the necessary support, but many people are calling for more radical action. Whatever the outcome, this case highlights the importance of providing the right support to vulnerable families. With more investment and better training for social workers, we can hopefully prevent cases like this from happening in the future, and ensure that every child has the chance to grow up in a safe and supportive environment.","(470, 20)","By. Leon Watson. UPDATED:. 18:40 EST, 7 March 2012. A young
couple who died in a house fire along with their three children were
known to social services, it was revealed today.
Police said they were investigating the cause of the blaze at the
semi-detached house in Walthamstow, east London, which broke out in
the early hours of this morning.
Neighbours reported hearing screams coming from the property as the
fire took hold, but firefighters were unable to save the family.
The victims have been formally identified as 27-year-old mother
Sharon Pickering, her 29-year-old partner Michael Boyle and their
three children, aged six, four and two.
A post-mortem examination will be carried out tomorrow to establish
the cause of their deaths.
Detective Chief Inspector Dave Whellams, from the Homicide and
Major Crime Command, said: ‘This is a tragic incident and our
thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have lost their
lives.
‘I would like to reassure the local community that we are carrying
out a thorough investigation to establish the cause of the fire.’
Mr Whellams added: ‘We are aware that the family were known to
social services and we are liaising with them as part of our
investigation.
‘I would appeal to anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in
the area around the time of the fire to get in touch with us.’
The fire broke out at around 1.30am at the semi-detached house in
Walthamstow where the family lived.
Neighbours said they heard screams coming from the house as the fire
took hold.
One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I heard a woman
screaming “help me, help me”.
‘I looked out of my window and I could see flames coming out of the
house. I called the fire brigade straight away.’
Another neighbour, who also did not wish to be named, added: ‘I
looked out of the window and there was a lot of smoke coming out of
the house.
‘I could hear a woman screaming “help me” and then I heard a man
shouting “get out, get out”.’
Firefighters arrived at the scene within minutes but were unable to
save the family.
A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade said: ‘Crews wearing breathing
apparatus entered the property and extinguished the fire using two
high pressure hose reels.
‘Sadly, despite their best efforts, they were unable to rescue the
family who were pronounced dead at the scene by London Ambulance
Service paramedics.
‘The cause of the fire is not known at this stage and is being
investigated by the Metropolitan Police.’
A police cordon has been put in place around the property while
forensic officers carry out an examination of the scene.
The bodies of the victims have been removed from the property and
taken to the mortuary at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel,
east London.
An inquest into their deaths has been opened and adjourned at
Poplar Coroner’s Court.

For the fifth year straight, Washington ranked as the country's most bicycle-friendly state, thanks to
","For the fifth year straight, Washington ranked as the country's most bicycle-friendly state, thanks to policies designed to create alternatives to driving, according to the League of American Bicyclists. The advocacy group's Bicycle Friendly State Program ranks the states each year under a series of criteria, from laws and regulations that govern bicycling to policies for accommodating cyclists and infrastructure funding. In each of the top five states -- Washington, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Colorado and Oregon -- the focus of the respective Departments of Transportation is not only on highways but on accommodating pedestrians, cyclists and transportation on ferries and trains, said Matt Wempe, the league's state and local advocacy coordinator. Arkansas, considered one of the least safe places for cyclists based on fatalities, was at the bottom of the list. The league's top recommendation was to adopt a statewide bicycle plan and to establish an advisory committee to oversee its implementation. Washington is considered a model for all other states on using federal funds for bicycle and pedestrian projects. It also earned points for adopting a safe passing and vulnerable road user law, which carries enhanced penalties for motorists who severely injure or kill a cyclist or pedestrian, Wempe said. It also creates a minimum 3-foot ""safe passing"" distance for cyclists by motorists. Related: Drivers and cyclists square off on sharing the road to work . The state also has a ""complete streets"" policy, which means new roads must be designed with cyclists and pedestrians in mind, Wempe said. ""Every state says bicycles are treated the same as vehicles, but that needs to be clarified,"" he said. ""We're stressing that bicycles have the same rights and responsibilities as motor vehicles, but their needs in terms of infrastructure need to be clarified."" Minnesota, which claimed the No. 2 spot, also has a complete streets policy. The state also earned kudos for its bike-sharing program and plans to expand bike trails along the Mississippi River. Colorado cracked the top 10 for the first time with qualities that make it a model for other states in terms of traffic laws, Wempe said. It has a safe passing law and a Share the Road Campaign; cyclists are allowed to ride side-by-side. It also has bicycle commuter share of more than 1%, more than double the national average. ""We are encouraged to see significant progress in top states like Washington, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts,"" Andy Clarke, president of the League of American Bicyclists, said in a statement. ""But, as the scores clearly highlight, there's much work to be done in critical areas like infrastructure and funding. Overall, we see states -- and especially state Departments of Transportation and state legislatures -- lagging behind cities and the expectations of local cyclists, despite the many well documented benefits of a more active lifestyle.""","(539, 21)","Washington has once again been crowned the most bicycle-friendly state in the U.S. for the fifth year in a row. According to the League of American Bicyclists, Washington takes the top spot for its commitment to developing cycling infrastructure, improving safety for cyclists and promoting cycling as a mode of transportation.  One notable effort that contributed to Washington's top spot is the newly passed law that imposes penalties on motorists who injure or kill cyclists. The law aims to promote safety and accountability on the roads, making Washington an even safer place to bike.  Minnesota claimed the second spot thanks to its successful bike-sharing program and plans to expand its bike trails network, providing more options for cyclists. The state's Nice Ride program, which launched in 2010, has since grown to 2,000 bikes, available for rent at over 200 stations, and boasts a highly successful membership program. Moving down the ladder, Arkansas comes in last for bicycle-friendliness. The state failed to make significant progress towards improving cycling infrastructure, and its bike safety laws remain lax. The lack of bike-specific infrastructure and education programs for cyclists means that cycling in Arkansas can be a dangerous endeavor. Biking has become a growing trend in recent years, with more Americans choosing to use bicycles as their primary mode of transportation. As the demand for bicycle-friendly cities grows, states and cities are increasingly investing in cycling infrastructure, aiming to improve safety and encourage more people to take up cycling.  According to a report by PeopleForBikes, the U.S has witnessed an increase in bike routes, lanes, and trails nationwide since 2010, making it easier for people to ride a bicycle. Improvements in bicycle infrastructure are essential in promoting active transportation, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality. States like Washington, Minnesota, and California have set the standard for investing in cycling infrastructure, and more states are following suit. In 2020, New York City announced plans to invest $58.4 million in cycling infrastructure, including $34 million in protected bike lanes, while cyclist activist groups called on the city authorities to make larger investments in cycling infrastructure.  Despite the progress made in some states, there is still a long way to go before cycling infrastructure is readily accessible nationwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of active transportation, with many people turning to cycling to avoid public transport. However, without proper infrastructure and education, cycling can still be hazardous.  In conclusion, Washington continues to lead the nation when it comes to creating a bicycle-friendly environment. Enactment of laws like the one incentivizing motorists to drive safely and other moves such as investment in cycling infrastructure improves the cycling experience which can also contribute to reducing carbon emissions. As more cities and states work to promote cycling as a viable mode of transportation, it is necessary to focus more on protecting cyclists, providing bicycle-specific infrastructure, and educating motorists on road safety.","(543, 21)","For the fifth year straight, Washington ranked as the country's most bicycle-friendly state, thanks to
its extensive network of bike lanes and trails, as well as its commitment to promoting cycling as a
sustainable mode of transportation. The state passed a law that carries penalties for motorists who
injure or kill cyclists, which has helped to create a safer environment for cyclists on the roads. In
addition, Minnesota took the second spot for its bike-sharing program, which allows residents and
visitors to rent bicycles for short trips around the city. The state also plans to expand its bike trails,
which will make it even easier for people to get around without relying on cars. Arkansas, on the
other hand, took last place due to its lack of infrastructure and support for cycling. The state does not
have any bike lanes or trails, and there are no laws in place to protect cyclists from reckless drivers.
Overall, these rankings highlight the importance of investing in cycling infrastructure and promoting
cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation. By making it easier and safer for people to cycle, we
can reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and promote healthier lifestyles.","(220, 8)",,

A supervisor at a Seattle warehouse was caught raping a fellow worker who was developmentally disabled whilst he was on the job and then went on to justify his vile actions by saying the woman 'wouldn't know the difference.' James A. Neligan, 54, was caught in the act as he was having sex with the woman inside a cubicle. According to court documents, his colleague had the intellectual abilities of an eight or nine-year-old. Still free: The case was heard at the King County Superior Courthouse in Seattle, but Neligan has not been jailed . Caught with his fly down and genitals exposed, the creep is alleged to have told the other worker to 'mind her own business.' A Seattle Police detective said the alleged victim then began crying. Neligan shook his head, zipped his fly and walked away. Neligan went on to say 'don't tell nobody' and that she would get in trouble if she told someone about the incident. The . woman said the man touched her sexually after she told him not to, and . that he continued to do so after she told him to stop. Both had worked for together for more than ten years at the warehouse where Neligan was a supervisor. Neligan . was fired following the incident and claimed the witness who caught him . had misunderstood what was happening in the cubicle. He soon changed his story after detectives told him that DNA evidence collected following the incident. Sweating profusely, Neligan said he had been teaching the woman how to have sex after she asked him for advise. He is alleged to have admitted having sexual contact with her for about a year. 'I asked James if he was ever nervous about getting caught and he replied ‘Oh of course, yeah,’' the detective told the court. 'I asked why and he explained because he knew he wasn’t supposed to be doing it.' When asked if he felt guilty about being physical with the victim because she was developmentally disabled, Neligan said 'probably, I would assume so; I guess that would have a lot more to do with it, yeah.' Although Neligan has been charged in the case, he had not been jailed.","(446, 29)","A former college employee has been convicted of performing sex acts on a mentally challenged coworker. James A. Neligan, who worked at a college in Florida, was found guilty of having sexual relations with another staff member whose mental capacity was compared to that of a nine-year-old child. Neligan initially claimed that the acts were consensual between adults. However, his story quickly fell apart after DNA evidence was recovered by police during their investigation into the alleged sexual assault. The incident took place in 2018, when the victim, whose identity is being kept confidential, was discovered by college authorities in a classroom with Neligan, who was performing sexual acts upon her. The victim was immediately removed from the situation and an investigation by authorities began. When authorities questioned Neligan, he maintained that the sexual acts were consensual between two adults. However, a DNA sample taken from the victim proved otherwise. The sample matched that of Neligan, who then changed his story, admitting to having sexual relations with the woman. The victim's mental age was determined to be that of a nine-year-old, making her unable to give consent. Neligan was charged with sexual battery on a vulnerable person and was found guilty by a jury in court. The college released a statement condemning Neligan's actions, stating that they were disappointed in his behavior and that the safety and well-being of their students and staff remain a top priority. The college is also offering counseling to anyone affected by the incident. The victim's family released a statement expressing their gratitude to the authorities for their support and guidance throughout the trial. They also expressed their hope that this situation would bring awareness to the issue of vulnerable individuals being taken advantage of in the workplace. Neligan now faces several years in prison and will also be required to register as a sex offender. His conviction serves as a reminder that sexual assault and misconduct will not be tolerated, especially when it involves vulnerable individuals who are unable to fully comprehend or consent to sexual activity.","(377, 17)","By.

James A. Neligan, 26, has been charged with two counts of first-degree sexual assault and one count of second-degree sexual assault.
Neligan, who worked as a teacher’s aide at the school, was arrested on Friday after a student reported that he had been sexually assaulted by Neligan.
The student told police that Neligan had forced him to perform oral sex on him in a bathroom at the school.
Neligan has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
Neligan is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.
A former teacher’s aide at a Connecticut high school has been arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a student.
James A Neligan, 27, was taken into custody on Friday after a female student reported that he sexually assaulted her in a school bathroom.
Neligan was arrested and charged with first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, and risk of injury to a minor.
He is being held on $100,000 bond and is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Monday.
The victim, who is 17 years old, told police that she was in the bathroom when Neligan approached her and began touching her inappropriately.
She said that Neligan then forced her to perform a sex act on him.
The victim said that she was scared and did not know what to do, so she complied with Neligan’s demands.
After the incident, the victim told a friend what had happened, and the friend reported the incident to school officials.
School officials then contacted police, and Neligan was arrested.
This is not the first time that Neligan has been accused of sexual misconduct.
In 2012, he was accused of sexually assaulting a student at a different school.
However, the charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence.
It is unclear why Neligan was allowed to continue working at the school after the 2012 incident.
Neligan’s arrest has sparked outrage among parents and students at the school.
Many are calling for Neligan to be fired and for the school to take steps to ensure that this type of incident does not happen again.
Others are concerned about the safety of the students at the school and are calling for increased security measures to be put in place.
The school has not yet released a statement about the incident.
However, a spokesperson for the school district said that they are taking the allegations seriously and that they are cooperating with the police investigation.
The spokesperson also said that the school is committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for all of its students.
Neligan faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of the charges against him.","(515, 29)",,

From battered snake to spit-roasted bats, the smorgasbord of traditional delicacies on offer are not exactly appetising. Scroll down for video . Macabre: Spit-roasted bats are stacked on a plastic tables at Langowan Market in Sulawesi, Indonesia . Horrifying: Live dogs are sat in cages before being roasted with a blow torch on the muck-covered pavement . Grotesque: Tourists look in horror at lizards lying on their backs - cut open - with their insides on display . Live dogs sit in cages before they are roasted with blowtorches on the pavement. Three-metre-long snakes lie sprawled across the tables of blood-covered carcasses. Other delights include pickled rats, boar legs, and bite-size bats on sticks. And roasted lizards are cut open and displayed on their backs - with their insides on show. Casual: Locals casually survey the bloody carcasses of boars and bats, which are delicacies in the region . Snack: Bite-size black bats are sold on sticks to market-goers, which will make holiday-goers' stomachs turn . Controversy: The market is under constant surveillance by the government after selling endangered species . Graphic: Vegetables and spices are sold at the market but the hanging boar legs will stay in tourists' minds . The market, in the northern region of  Sulawesi, was marred by controversy in 1993 after government inspectors found sellers to be trading babirusa, an endangered type of wild pig. Despite numerous regulations put in place, it took years to eliminate the trade. However, the bizarre market has now become something of a tourist attraction - but few are willing to taste their way through the full menu. Not far from Langowan, the Tomohon Traditional Market also attracts a fair few horrified holidaymakers - and families planning their evening meal. All in a day's work: A market seller hacks away at a three-metre-long snake using three different knives . Portions: The segments are gruesomely displayed on the dirty, tiled worktops for customers to buy . Stash: One customer has stocked up on roasted rats for this evening's meal, piling them all into a basket . Grab-and-go: This man appears to have forgotten a bag - but seems not to mind carrying to wild boars' legs . Family day out: A child munches on a treat bought from the traditional market while his family select their meal . They casually survey the torched animals - lying frozen with a facial expression of horror - before selecting an entire snake or dog to serve up to the kids later. Travel blogger Raymond Walsh described the smell of the Tomohon market on his blog www.manonthelam.com. Mr Walsh said: 'In a word, appalling. There's something about the air that changes when there's that much death around. 'It hangs heavy and it made me queasy and light-headed at the same time... It's the first time I'd ever encountered anything like it.'","(565, 32)","Langowan Market in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, is attracting tourists from all over the world who want to taste the unique and bizarre traditional food. Vendors at the market offer a variety of exotic dishes, including spit-roasted bats, battered snake, pickled rats, and boar legs. The market has become a popular destination for tourists who want to experience something new and different to their regular diet. Trying the delicacies at Langowan Market offers a chance to immerse oneself in the local culture, which has been handed down from generation to generation. However, the sale of endangered species at the market is a cause of concern for authorities. Government officials have been putting pressure on sellers to stop trading in threatened or illegally obtained animals. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has also expressed concern that the market is contributing to the decline in population of certain species. Despite these concerns, some vendors continue to sell these illegal products, which are seen as delicacies by many locals. The government's efforts to curb such sales have had little success, as many of these vendors have been doing business for generations and rely on the sale of these items for their livelihood. Local residents are divided on the issue, with some arguing that the market is part of their cultural heritage and should be protected from outside influence. Others believe that changes need to be made to ensure that the sale of endangered species ceases immediately. The local government, meanwhile, is exploring ways to address the concerns raised by conservationists without disrupting the livelihoods of the market's vendors. One solution being suggested is the introduction of alternative sources of income for vendors who stop selling illegal and endangered products. Despite the controversy, tourists continue to flock to the market to taste the unique traditional food on offer. Many visitors are aware of the ethical and environmental concerns surrounding the sale of certain products and do their best to avoid them, opting instead for dishes made from locally sourced, sustainable ingredients. Langowan Market is an important part of local culture, and the government's efforts to conserve endangered species are to be applauded.

Al-Douri, who served as a military commander and vice president in Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime, was last seen on video shortly after the invasion of Iraq. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos posted on YouTube or the identity of the man, though he bears a striking resemblance to al-Douri. In the clips, the man who claims to be al-Douri wears an olive military uniform and sits behind a desk with an Iraqi flag in the background. He derides Iraq's Shiite-dominated government, led by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, as well as what he describes as meddling by neighboring Iran. Al-Maliki's Dawa party, says al-Douri, ""has announced Iraq as the Shiite capital."" He said nine years have passed since the invasion and Iraq is still in peril. ""Everyone can hear the sounds of danger echoing daily and threatening the country,"" he said. The videos were posted on what is the 65th anniversary of the Arab Socialist Baath Party, a political party founded in Syria that later provided the political basis for Iraq's now outlawed Baath Party. The U.S. military has said al-Douri helped finance the Sunni insurgency with money he transferred to Syria before the government collapsed shortly after the U.S.-led invasion. Al-Douri was the deputy chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council, and U.S. officials have said he played a key role in the 1988 chemical attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja that left thousands dead and thousands more wounded. He also is accused of playing a role in the brutal crackdowns on Kurdish and Shiite revolts in Iraq that followed the 1991 Persian Gulf War.","(410, 14)","Former senior Iraqi official Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, known as the ""king of clubs"" for his identification on a deck of playing cards used to locate wanted officials, has reportedly resurfaced in a video. In the clips, which were released last week, al-Douri can be seen criticizing Iraq's Shiite leaders. Al-Douri was a prominent figure during the regime of Saddam Hussein, where he served as the vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council. Following the overthrow of Hussein's regime in 2003, al-Douri went into hiding, and he had been reported dead on several occasions. However, in the video, he appears to be in good health and talks about the current state of Iraq. The U.S. military has accused al-Douri of funding the Sunni insurgency in Iraq that caused many deaths and injuries, and his capture or killing was a top priority for the U.S. forces during their involvement in the country. The Iraqi government has also issued an arrest warrant for al-Douri, accusing him of terrorism activities. In the video, al-Douri can be seen sitting in a chair wearing a military uniform and addressing the camera. He criticizes the current Iraqi government, which he describes as ""sectarian,"" and calls for the formation of a national government that represents all segments of Iraqi society. Al-Douri, who is believed to be in his 70s, also accuses Iran of interfering in Iraqi affairs and backing Shiite militias that have committed atrocities against Sunni Muslims. He calls on Iraqis to unite against what he calls Iran's attempts to dominate the region. The video has sparked concern among the Iraqi authorities, who fear that it could encourage Sunni militants to launch attacks against Shiite targets. The Iraqi security forces have stepped up their efforts to track down al-Douri, and they have urged the public to report any sightings of him. Al-Douri's reappearance in the video comes at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which are both vying for influence in Iraq. The U.S. has accused Iran of supporting Shiite militias in the country, and the two nations have engaged in a war of words in recent months. Al-Douri's video is a reminder of the deep divisions that continue to exist in Iraq, despite the defeat of ISIS and the ousting of the Saddam Hussein regime. The challenge now is for the Iraqi authorities to address these divisions and find a way to bring the country together.","(451, 17)","A series of videos appeared online Saturday purporting to show Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the highest-ranking
Saddam Hussein-era official still at large in Iraq, denouncing the country's Shiite-led government.
The U.S. military said it could not confirm the authenticity of the videos, but if they are genuine, they would
mark the first time al-Douri has been seen in public since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
In the videos, a man who identifies himself as al-Douri criticizes Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his
Shiite-led government for failing to provide basic services such as electricity and clean water.
Al-Douri also denounces the U.S. military presence in Iraq, which is scheduled to end by the end of the year,
and calls on Iraqis to rise up against the government.
Al-Douri, who is believed to be in his mid-60s, was Saddam Hussein's vice president and a member of the
ruling Revolutionary Command Council. He was one of the most powerful men in Iraq before the 2003
U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam's regime.
Al-Douri has been on the FBI's most-wanted list since 2003, with a reward of up to $10 million for information
leading to his capture. The U.S. State Department has offered a $30 million reward for information leading to
the arrest or conviction of al-Douri and other senior members of Saddam's regime.
In the past few years, al-Douri has emerged as the leader of the Naqshabandi Army, a Sunni insurgent group
that has carried out numerous attacks against U.S. and Iraqi forces. The group is believed to have ties to al-
Qaida in Iraq and other Sunni extremist groups.
Al-Douri's whereabouts have been a mystery since the fall of Saddam's regime in 2003. He is believed to have
fled to Syria after the U.S. invasion, but there have been reports that he has been hiding in various parts of
Iraq, including the northern city of Mosul and the western province of Anbar.
In recent months, there have been several reports that al-Douri had been killed or captured, but none of them
have been confirmed. If the videos are genuine, it would suggest that al-Douri is still alive and well, and that he
remains a major threat to the stability of Iraq.
The appearance of the videos comes at a time when Iraq is facing a number of challenges, including a surge in
violence, political instability, and economic problems. The country is also struggling to deal with the aftermath
of the Islamic State group's takeover of large parts of northern and western Iraq in 2014.
The emergence of the videos is likely to raise concerns about the security situation in Iraq and the ability of the
government to maintain control over the country. It is also likely to fuel speculation about the future of al-
Douri and his role in the ongoing conflict in Iraq.
The videos are also likely to have an impact on U.S. policy towards Iraq. The United States has been
supporting the Iraqi government in its fight against the Islamic State group, but the emergence of the videos
could raise questions about the effectiveness of U.S. efforts to stabilize the country.
Overall, the appearance of the videos is a significant development in the ongoing struggle for power in Iraq.
It remains to be seen how the Iraqi government and the United States will respond to the challenge posed by
al-Douri and his supporters.","(620, 22)",,

The incident occurred when Ellie, who was dressed up as Mrs. Santa, lost her balance and toppled over the edge. However, the situation quickly turned into an emotional moment when Ellie managed to hold onto a baby named Poppy who was also on the catwalk with her. As the cameras kept rolling, viewers could hear the sound of Poppy crying in the background while Ellie tried to regain her footing. The tension in the studio was palpable as the presenter and other models watched on in concern. However, Ellie managed to hold on to Poppy and make her way back to safety without any further missteps. The incident happened earlier today during a live broadcast of This Morning's fashion segment. Ellie, who usually works behind the scenes on the show, had stepped in to model for a segment on festive-themed outfits. Her turn on the catwalk soon took a turn for the worse when she lost her footing and nearly fell off the stage. Fortunately, Ellie's maternal instincts kicked in, and she managed to hold onto Poppy, ensuring the baby's safety despite the unexpected tumble. Though this was a terrifying moment for those in the studio, it also demonstrated the quick thinking and problem-solving skills needed for such events. Ellie is being hailed as a hero for her bravery in protecting the infant from harm. In the aftermath of the incident, the presenter of the show has praised Ellie's quick thinking, and the studio staff has extended their support to the two. It is not clear whether Ellie sustained any injuries during her fall. However, she has received widespread praise for her bravery and her quick thinking in an unexpected and potentially hazardous situation. The incident has been a talking point on social media, with many praising Ellie for her bravery and maternal instincts during the incident. While accidental mishaps are not uncommon during live television segments, Ellie's quick thinking has been widely appreciated by viewers and fellow colleagues alike. This moment serves as a reminder of the importance of preparedness and quick thinking in a crisis, and a testament to the strength of the human spirit in the face of unexpected obstacles.","(436, 18)","By.

This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby was left red-faced after her co-presenter Phillip Schofield accidentally flashed his manhood live on air.
The 33-year-old mother-of-two, who is currently pregnant with her third child, was forced to cover her face with her hands in horror as she realised what had happened.
Phillip, 50, had been demonstrating how to put up a Christmas tree on the ITV1 daytime show when the incident occurred.
He said: ‘I’m going to show you how to put up your Christmas tree. I’m going to do it properly this time.’
Holly, who was sitting next to him on the sofa, replied: ‘That’s what you said last year.’
Phillip then proceeded to demonstrate how to put up the tree, which was decorated with baubles, tinsel and fairy lights.
However, as he bent down to pick up a bauble from the floor, his trousers slipped down to reveal his manhood.
Holly quickly covered her face with her hand as she realised what was happening.
She said: ‘Oh my God! Oh my God!’
Phillip, who was unaware of what had happened, carried on putting up the tree as if nothing had happened.
Holly, who is married to Dan Baldwin and has two children, Harry, six, and Belle, four, with him, said: ‘I can’t believe that just happened.’
Phillip said: ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’
Holly replied: ‘You know exactly what I’m talking about.’
Phillip added: ‘I’ve got no idea what you are talking about.’
As Holly continued to cover her face in embarrassment, Phillip said: ‘What are you doing? What are you doing?’
Holly said: ‘Don’t look at me. Don’t look at me.’
Phillip replied: ‘I’m not looking at you. I’m looking at the tree.’
Holly then said: ‘No you’re not. You’re not looking at the tree. You’re looking at my face.’
Phillip finally realised what had happened and said: ‘Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear.’
Holly added: ‘I’m so embarrassed. I’m so embarrassed.’
Phillip apologised and said: ‘I didn’t mean to do that. I’m so sorry.’
Holly laughed and said: ‘It’s fine. It’s fine.’
The pair then carried on with the rest of the show without any further mention of the incident.
A spokesman for This Morning said: ‘It was a genuine accident. There was no malice intended.’

It has long been an integral part of school chemistry lessons - and a revision
","It has long been an integral part of school chemistry lessons - and a revision nightmare for students the world over. Now there is one more element to add to the periodic table - and a 'super-heavy' one at that. Scientists in Sweden have confirmed the existence of a new chemical element, but its name may need some work. The 'super-heavy' man-made element has been temporarily named 'ununpentium' and refers to the element's 115th place in the periodic table. Scientists in Sweden have confirmed the existence of a new chemical element. The 'super-heavy' man-made element has been temporarily named 'ununpentium' and refers to its 115th place in the periodic table . Ununpentium will likely get a new name if the discovery is formally . approved by experts from the International Union of Pure and Applied . Physics and Chemistry. It presently has an . atomic symbol of Uup and is approximately 289 times heavier than hydrogen, which is the . lightest element. Researchers at Lund University in Sweden lead the research and said their find backs up claims by teams in Russia and the United States a decade ago that had remained unverified until now. The Swedish scientists say they conducted experiments which allowed them to detect the `fingerprint' of the short-lived but heavy element. The experiment was conducted at the GSI research facility in Germany. 'This was a very successful experiment and is one of the most important in the field in recent years', said Dirk Rudolph, Professor at the Division of Nuclear Physics at Lund University. Ununpentium will likely get a new name if the discovery is formally approved by experts from the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics and Chemistry. It presently has an atomic symbol of Uup and is approximately 289 times heavier than hydrogen - the lightest element . Besides the observations of the new chemical element, the researchers have also gained access to data that gives them a deeper insight into the structure and properties of super-heavy atomic nuclei. By bombarding a thin film of americium with calcium ions, the research team was able to measure photons in connection with the new element’s alpha decay. Certain energies of the photons agreed with the expected energies for X-ray radiation, which is a ‘fingerprint’ of a given element. Some people have claimed ununpentium is used by UFOs as a component in gravity wave generators, The Telegraph reported. The new element also makes an appearance in computer games including Tomb Raider and Call of Duty, where it is an energy source for weapons and teleporters. However, due to its unstable nature, its uses in the real world are likely to be few and far between. Livermorium, which has the atomic number of 116, is the most recent element to be approved and win a spot on the periodic table in May 2012.","(521, 25)","Ununpentium: The Heavy Element in Search of a New Name Ununpentium, the heavy man-made element currently placed at 115th on the periodic table, may soon have a new name if experts finally approve its discovery. The element, also known as element 115 or E115, was first synthesized in 2003 by a team of Russian and American physicists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. Like many other artificial elements, ununpentium is extremely unstable, with a half-life of only a few milliseconds. However, it is still of great interest to scientists, as its unique properties could potentially lead to the development of new materials with extraordinary properties. But ununpentium is not just a topic of discussion for physicists and chemists. It has also made appearances in popular culture, particularly in computer games such as Call of Duty. In the game, ununpentium is portrayed as a powerful energy source that powers advanced weapons and spacecraft. However, for some people, ununpentium is more than just a fictional element. Many conspiracy theorists and alien enthusiasts believe that the element has been used by extraterrestrial beings for advanced technology. They point to supposed accounts of ununpentium being recovered from crashed UFOs, as well as the fact that the element was allegedly mentioned in classified documents supposedly leaked by whistleblowers. Despite these claims, there is no concrete evidence to support the notion that ununpentium has any extraterrestrial origins or applications. But the search for a new name for element 115 is not just the result of conspiracy theories or pop culture references. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the organization responsible for officially recognizing new elements and approving their names, requires that elements be named based on certain criteria, such as honoring a person, a place, a property, or a mythological concept. For ununpentium, the current temporary name is simply based on its atomic number, which stands for the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. However, this name is not very practical, as it does not provide any information about the element's properties or origins. Several proposals have been made for a new name for ununpentium, such as moscovium, after the city of Moscow, where the element was first synthesized. Other suggestions include eka-bismuth, to emphasize the element's position as a member of the bismuth group, or after famous scientists or science fiction characters. But proposing a name for a new element is not an easy task, as the name must be agreed upon by experts in the field and undergo a thorough review process. For instance, the proposed name must not be duplicated with any other element or mineral name, and must not hold any political or commercial connotations. While the hunt for a new name continues, ununpentium remains an intriguing subject both for scientists and for those interested in the intersection of science, culture, and mythology. Whether it will ever become a staple of advanced technology or remain a curiosity of the periodic table is yet to be seen, but one thing is certain: element 115 will need a new name that does justice to its unique properties and place in history.","(591, 21)",,,,
