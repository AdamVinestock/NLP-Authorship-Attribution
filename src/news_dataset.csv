Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest
","Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest of his Uruguay team-mates on Thursday. England take on Uruguay later this week in what Hart believes is a 'do-or-die' match because of Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Italy. Suarez is back in full training following a knee injury and is expected to start the match at the Itaquerao Stadium. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez looking sharp in training . Prepared: Joe Hart says he is ready for the challenge of Uruguay on Thursday . Suarez enjoyed a prolific year with Liverpool last season, scoring 27 league goals, and Uruguay also have the considerable talents of Diego Forlan and Edinson Cavani to call upon. Hart has been studying videos of all the Uruguay players, though, to make sure he is ready to stop whatever the opposition throws at him on Thursday. 'Dave [Watson, goalkeeping coach] studies the tapes of Uruguay and we are well aware of their strikers and their pattern of finishing,' England's number one told TheFA.com. 'We had a lot of sharp shots around the . box (in training). We cover in general, but we specify short, sharp . shots as they have got a lot of boys who get it out of their feet and . bang it.' England need to beat Uruguay and Costa Rica to guarantee their progression to the knock-out stages. Eyes on the prize: Luis Suarez trained on Tuesday and is expected to be fit to face England . Kicking into gear: Luis Suarez says he is 100 per cent fit to face England after his knee problems . No surprises: Joe Hart has faced Luis Suarez countless times in the Premier League . Head boy: Mario Balotelli (left) scored the winning goal as England lost to Italy last Saturday . A draw and a win could be enough for England to qualify, providing other results go their way, but Hart sees Thursday's game as a must-win. 'We've got to win in Sao Paulo,' said the 27-year-old, who earned his 41st cap in Manaus. 'We did play well (against Italy) and there were a lot of positives, but the outcome was not want we wanted and it's not what we've come here for. 'We've put ourselves in a do-or-die situation, which we are prepared for. We need to win. We didn't go into the Italian game with any intention of losing - it's done now, we've moved on.'","(469, 24)","England goalkeeper Joe Hart has been closely monitoring footage of Uruguay's strikers ahead of their crucial World Cup clash on Thursday. Hart has said that Roy Hodgson's side are fully aware that they must win the match against Uruguay, following their narrow defeat to Italy in their opening game. Hart also revealed that he has been closely studying Uruguay’s forwards, particularly the returning Luis Suarez, who has now resumed full training following an injury. Suarez is expected to start against England, and Hart knows that he and his team-mates will need to be on top form if they are to prevent the world's most in-form striker from finding the net. England's preparations for the Uruguay game have been disrupted by a number of injuries, most notably to captain Steven Gerrard and centre-back Gary Cahill. However, Hart remains confident that Hodgson's side can still secure a crucial victory, despite their injury setbacks. England are also hoping to welcome back Danny Welbeck for the game, after the Manchester United forward missed the opening fixture through injury. Welbeck's pace and energy could prove to be a key asset for England, particularly if they look to exploit the aging Uruguayan defence. However, England will also need to be wary of the threat posed by Uruguay's attacking players, particularly Suarez, who has been in sensational form for Liverpool over the past season. The Liverpool forward, who was named the Premier League's Player of the Year last season, is regarded by many as one of the best strikers in the world. His partnership with Edinson Cavani in particular could prove to be a major problem for England's defence. Despite the challenge facing them, Hart and his team-mates remain determined to secure a much-needed win on Thursday. With the likes of Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Welbeck in their ranks, England certainly have the attacking talent to cause Uruguay problems, and Hart is hopeful that they can produce the goods when it matters most. Of course, everything depends on the form Suarez exibits in the game. If he shows why he is regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, Hart and England’s defence will certainly have a tough time trying to keep him at bay. However, England has some talented forward players, and they will be looking to make the most of the chances that come their way. The match between England and Uruguay promises to be an enthralling encounter, with both sides eager to secure three points and keep their World Cup hopes alive. For Hart and England, it will be a case of remaining focused and organised at the back, while also looking to take advantage of any opportunities that arise in attack.","(507, 18)","Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest

By . Lizzie Parry . Dismayed shoppers in the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells
","By . Lizzie Parry . Dismayed shoppers in the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched as upmarket superstore Waitrose opened new branches across Kent. Stores have opened in Edenbridge, Crowborough, Ramsgate and Maidstone while Sevenoaks is preparing for the opening of their second branch. Even 'downmarket' Tonbridge has their own Waitrose, say angry campaigners. Dismayed shoppers in Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched for years as branches of Waitrose have popped up all across Kent. Residents have written to the firm urging them to open in the spa town, but to no avail . The small town of Edenbridge, population 8,000, welcomed their new Waitrose last month. Meanwhile the 56,500 well-to-do residents of Tunbridge Wells are left facing an eight-mile round trip to their nearest branch. Locals have mounted a campaign, writing to Waitrose to demand it opens a store in the spa town. Richard Shaw, 52, said: 'Every time . there is a whisper about a new shop coming to town, everyone gets their . knickers in a twist thinking it will be Waitrose. 'We've waited long enough, I think it's time the store just did the decent thing and opened a store here.' And Sarah Reed, 42, added: 'I've lived her for my entire life and . have seen Waitrose shops pop up all over the county - but never . anything for Tunbridge Wells. The existing branch of Waitrose in Sevenoaks. Locals in neighbouring Royal Tunbridge Wells are fuming that the town is set to welcome a second store in the coming months . Tunbridge Wells resident Richard Shaw, 52, said: 'We've waited long enough, I think it's time the store just did the decent thing and opened a store here.' Pictured is the Waitrose branch in Ramsgate . 'It's . very, very odd - the people here tend to be quite well off and . discerning, exactly the type of customers Waitrose should be aiming at, . but we don't get a look in. 'Even Dartford and Tonbridge have got one and now Sevenoaks will have two - it's very galling.' She said she had written to Waitrose . detailing other stores around the county which had opened and 'politely . requesting' they look at Tunbridge Wells. Local resident Anke, the voice behind The Royal Tunbridge Wells blog, which was launched in 2005, has spent years questioning whether Waitrose will grace the town with their presence. In 2005 he complained the company was 'making us trek to the next town to buy groceries'. A recent post said: 'We have reason for celebration this week, well if you're a shopper that is. 'No, . calm down, Waitrose hasn't arrived yet, but our main shopping centre . has won the prestigious award of ""Best Shopping Centre in the World"".' A Waitrose spokesman said last week: 'I can assure you we're still keen to bring a Waitrose to Tunbridge Wells, however have nothing further to update at the moment.'","(566, 36)","Residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells are expressing their frustration as Waitrose, a high-end supermarket chain, has chosen not to open a store in their town. Despite the recent opening of several branches across Kent, including a second store in Sevenoaks set to open in the coming months, locals in Royal Tunbridge Wells are feeling snubbed. The absence of a Waitrose in Royal Tunbridge Wells has left residents feeling let down. Many locals were hoping for the popular supermarket chain to open a new store in their town, but it appears their wishes have gone unanswered. Scores of residents took to social media to voice their displeasure at the situation. It is not clear why Waitrose has chosen not to open a branch in the town. However, industry insiders speculate that the relatively small population of Royal Tunbridge Wells, compared to the nearby towns of Sevenoaks and Tonbridge, may be a factor. It is also possible that Waitrose may have taken into account the fact that competitors, such as Sainsbury’s and Tesco, already have a presence in the town. Waitrose is a popular supermarket chain in the UK that is known for its high-quality products and customer service. The absence of a Waitrose store in Royal Tunbridge Wells may inconvenience residents who prefer the chain’s products and services. Some locals have expressed their disappointment and frustration at having to travel to nearby towns to shop at Waitrose. Despite the disappointment, some residents are hopeful that Waitrose may reconsider their decision in the future. The opening of a second store in Sevenoaks may indicate that the chain recognizes the potential for growth in the area. It is also possible that local demand for a Waitrose store in Royal Tunbridge Wells may persuade the company to review their decision. For now, residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells will have to make do with the presence of other supermarket chains in the town. However, the continued absence of a Waitrose store may be a missed opportunity for the company to tap into the affluent market in the town. Waitrose is a popular choice among consumers who are willing to pay a premium for high-quality products, and the town’s high-income demographic could be a lucrative market for the chain. In conclusion, the decision by Waitrose not to open a store in Royal Tunbridge Wells has left residents feeling disappointed and frustrated. However, the opening of a second store in Sevenoaks may provide some hope for those hoping for a Waitrose in their town. Only time will tell whether the popular supermarket chain will reconsider their decision and tap into the potential market in Royal Tunbridge Wells.","(482, 20)","By. Lizzie Parry.

(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by
","(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by 12 months until June 2012, killing off speculation that he could be on his way to Real Madrid. Coach Mourinho has signed an extended deal ending fears he could wave goodbye to Inter Milan. Former Chelsea supremo Mourinho took charge at Italian giants Inter a year ago following the departure of Roberto Mancini and has just guided the club to their fourth straight scudetto. They also won the Italian Super Cup, but were eliminated by defending champions Manchester United in the first knockout round of the Champions League. A statement on the Inter Web site read: ""In response to the wish of the coach to continue the project started together a year ago, a wish welcomed with pleasure by the club as a sign of attachment and winning spirit, FC Internazionale announces the extension of Jose Mourinho's contract until 30 June 2012."" Mourinho had promised the fans more titles would be on the after lifting his first Italian title, but the eal issue refused to go away until Monday's statement. When asked about the chance he could leave Inter, Mourinho had earlier told the club Web site: ""There is still a 0.01% (chance). But for me this is not an important number, it just means that I am closer to Inter than to Real. ""I am satisfied with the relationship with the fans and with my players. I repeat, I am closer to staying at Inter than going elsewhere."" Those comments failed to impress Inter president Massimo Moratti, but the extended contract has settled any differences. Mourinho made his mark at Porto in 2004 when he led the Portuguese team to the Champions League title, beating Monaco 3-0 in the final, before moving to Chelsea. At Stamford Bridge he claimed the Premier League title in each of his first two seasons and the FA Cup the following campaign, but left the club in September 2007. Not all Inter fans have warmed to the Portuguese since his arrival in Milan last summer. He has been involved in several disagreements with the Italian media and his style of play has has not endeared him to parts of the Nerazzurri faithful.","(414, 15)","It's official: Jose Mourinho will remain at the helm of Inter Milan for another couple of years. The Portuguese coach has put pen to paper on a new contract that keeps him at the Italian club until at least 30 June 2012. The decision to extend Mourinho's stay puts an end to months of speculation that he could be lured away to Spanish giants Real Madrid. With the 2008-2009 season culminating in a Serie A, Coppa Italia and Champions League triumph for the Italian club, Mourinho was already being recognized as one of the best coaches in the world. But as rumours swirled about his potential exit to Real Madrid, many Inter fans feared that this glorious chapter in the club's history might come to a premature end. Fortunately for the Nerazzurri faithful, Mourinho has apparently found everything he needs at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. ""I'm happy to confirm that I've signed an extension to my contract with Inter,"" he said in a statement. ""I have a great relationship with both the club and the fans, and I'm excited about the challenges that lie ahead."" Under Mourinho's leadership, Inter Milan have become a force to be reckoned with in Italian and European football. The Special One, as he likes to call himself, has raised the bar for Inter's domestic rivals, and has instilled a winning mentality in his players that was previously lacking. The result has been a remarkable run of success which could yet extend further, with Inter looking to defend their titles in Serie A, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League. The news that Mourinho will not be leaving for Real Madrid will come as a tremendous relief for Inter supporters. For many, the prospect of losing a coach of Mourinho's stature and pedigree was simply unthinkable. Now, with the Portuguese mastermind committed to staying in Milan, the club can look forward to a bright future and more success under his guidance. It remains to be seen, however, whether Mourinho's decision to stay with Inter will put an end to the speculation about his future. The rumour mill never sleeps, and other elite clubs may well be looking enviously at what the Portuguese coach has achieved in Italy. For now though, Inter Milan can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that their Special One will be with them for the foreseeable future.","(447, 17)","(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by

A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning . A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning. Blanc Brasserie in London's Covent Garden has been forbidden from offering pink lamb's liver after ignoring a warning from Westminster Council environmental health officers. The food presented an 'imminent risk of injury to health' because of the way it was cooked, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told today. French-born Mr Blanc, 62, is a director of the company that owns the restaurant. James Armitage, Westminster City Council's food, health and safety manager, said: 'After receiving two separate complaints of food poisoning which may have originated from eating at a Covent Garden restaurant, our officers investigated and issued a notice which prevented the restaurant from serving undercooked lambs' liver. 'Today's court decision to uphold the notice is welcome as the serving of undercooked meat, without suitable controls in place, is a public health risk. 'Health inspectors have agreed with the restaurant the safety measures that need to be in place for the restaurant to be allowed to safely put the dish back on its menu.' The two diners contracted campylobacter food poisoning after they had the dish on separate occasions this summer. Guidance from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) recommends that lamb's liver must be cooked at 70 degrees centigrade for at least two minutes. But the Brasserie Bar Co. said it had taken liver off the menu at all 18 of its Blanc Brasserie restaurants throughout Britain after it was ordered to pay £3,103 in costs. A spokeswoman said: 'Brasserie Bar Co. has not contested the environmental health officers' enforcement and will no longer serve liver in any of its restaurants. 'In order to serve liver and comply with Westminster Council, it would need to be overcooked to such an extent that our customers just won't eat it.' Mr Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons restaurant in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, was awarded two Michelin stars in 1985. There were more than 371,000 estimated cases of campylobacter food poisoning in England and Wales in 2009, resulting in more than 17,500 hospitalisations and 88 deaths, according to the FSA.

The restaurant, which is owned and directed by French-born chef Raymond Blanc, 62, was recently visited by environmental health officers after two diners complained of severe food poisoning. The diners had fallen ill with campylobacter, a type of bacteria commonly found in undercooked chicken or other poultry. Despite the warning from the health officers, Blanc Brasserie failed to take any immediate action to rectify their food safety procedures. Instead, the restaurant's management chose to carry on business as usual, putting the health and safety of their customers at risk. The situation at Blanc Brasserie has raised concerns among food safety experts, who warn that ignoring warnings from environmental health officers can have serious consequences. According to experts, failing to take prompt action can lead to the spread of foodborne illness among customers, potentially causing long-lasting health problems and possible legal action. The situation at Blanc Brasserie is particularly concerning given the restaurant's high-end reputation and status as a popular destination for foodies in London. Many of the restaurant's customers are passionate about their food and expect a top-quality dining experience, which includes food safety and hygiene standards that are beyond reproach. Raymond Blanc is a well-known figure in the culinary world, having appeared on numerous TV shows and written several cookbooks. He is also a staunch advocate for sustainable and ethical food practices. The fact that his restaurant seemingly ignored warnings from environmental health officers has raised eyebrows among his fans and supporters. Although the restaurant has not yet issued a statement about the situation, it is likely that the management will face significant backlash from customers and food safety advocates alike. It remains to be seen what steps they will take to rectify the issues raised by the environmental health officers. This incident serves as a reminder to all restaurants and food establishments about the importance of prioritizing food safety and hygiene. Ignoring warnings from experts can have serious health and legal repercussions, which can ultimately harm not only customers but businesses themselves. It is crucial that all food establishments take proactive measures to ensure that their products are safe and healthy for consumption.","(417, 17)","By. Leon Watson.

Two diners fell ill after eating at a top London restaurant run by celebrity chef Marco Pierre White, it has emerged.
Blanc Brasserie, which is owned by the French-born chef, 62, was visited by environmental health officers after two diners complained they had been struck down with campylobacter – a type of food poisoning caused by bacteria found in raw meat, poultry, eggs and unpasteurised milk.
A spokesman for Westminster City Council said: ‘We received a complaint from a member of the public that they had suffered from food poisoning after eating at the restaurant.
‘Environmental health officers visited the premises and issued a hygiene improvement notice.’
The notice, which was issued on October 31, requires the restaurant to take action to improve its hygiene standards within 28 days.
It is not known whether the two diners who fell ill ate at the restaurant on the same day.
A spokesman for the restaurant said: ‘We can confirm that we received a hygiene improvement notice from Westminster City Council on October 31.
‘We are working closely with the council to address the issues raised in the notice.’
Marco Pierre White, who was the youngest chef to be awarded three Michelin stars at the age of 33, opened Blanc Brasserie in Covent Garden in 2009.

Mr Thornton grabbed the severed feet and wrapped them in a t-shirt hoping doctors might be able to reattach them. He was surprised by how calm the boy was. He seemed more concerned about someone finding and telling his mother more than anything else. Mr Thornton's 15-year-old daughter stayed with the boy while her Dad got help.

Marshawn Farr-Robbins, from St. Paul, Minnesota, was playing with friends when he attempted to climb on to a slow moving train.
He slipped and fell under the wheels of the train, which ran over his feet, cutting them off.
Marshawn was rushed to the Gillette Children’s Hospital in St. Paul, where he remains in a stable condition.
His family have asked for their privacy to be respected as they come to terms with what has happened.
St. Paul police spokesman Sgt. Mike Ernster said: ‘It’s a very sad situation. It’s just a tragic accident.’
Ernster said the incident happened around 6.30pm on Tuesday evening.
He said: ‘We don’t know why he was trying to get on the train. We don’t know if he was trying to play on the train or if he wanted to ride the train.
‘We don’t know if it was a spur of the moment thing or if he had been thinking about it for a while.’
He added: ‘I don’t think we’ll ever know why he did what he did.’
Marshawn’s family have set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to help pay for his medical bills.
The page reads: ‘On August 13, 2013, our son Marshawn Farr Robbin’s life changed forever.

","Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to play in the Champions League next season. The rules now effectively set up a scenario where rivals can claim City have cheated their way to passing UEFA’s ‘Financial Fair Play’ (FFP) test. It is understood lawyers for a host of ‘major clubs’ are aware of these potential rights to make appeals — thanks to recently amended Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations — and are monitoring the situation closely. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho question the fairness of FFP . Expensive squad: But could Manchester City's big-spending ways cost them a Champions League place? On Saturday night Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who faces City on Monday in the game of the season so far, accused some unnamed clubs of ‘dodgy FFP’. He said: ‘There are clubs that are following exactly the project of Financial Fair Play and there are other clubs doing it in a dodgy way. For me, that is very clear. I don’t say the clubs — that is not my job.’ When asked specifically about City, and a potential UEFA investigation, he added: ‘It’s for Mr Platini and other people to analyse it, it’s not for me… I’m waiting for that.’ Financial force: Manchester City's spending power is among the greatest in football . 'Dodgy FFP'? Jose Mourinho was critical, but he manages another expensive squad at Chelsea . Concern? Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has a proven track record in the Champions League . FFP rules compel clubs to limit losses for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons combined to £37million, with a ban from European competitions the severest theoretical punishment. City last week announced losses for 2012-13 of £51.6m, meaning they have lost £149.5m over two years. They can perhaps ‘exempt’ as much as £110m of those losses to meet FFP requirements. But they face accusations their losses are artificially low after earning cash from ‘intellectual property’ sales to related companies. UEFA sources have confirmed this will be investigated to see if it is ‘real’ income. Amended small print in the 2014 UEFA FFP rulebook, just published, includes two key changes; one allowing clubs to ‘plea bargain’ punishments for overspending, and another that allows other clubs to challenge those plea bargains if they feel the outcomes negatively affect them. Time to celebrate? Liverpool are one of the clubs not in a position to compete with City's financial muscle . Title rivals: Arsenal could be another team to benefit if City are to face a form of punishment . Money well spent: The signings of players like Sergio Aguero have turned City into a real force .","(520, 23)","The eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League has been thrown into doubt due to a small print in the Financial Fair Play (FFP) rule of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). This has caused concern among the club's supporters, who are worried about the possibility of their beloved team being disqualified from the coveted tournament. The FFP was established to promote financial stability and fair competition among football clubs in Europe. It requires clubs to balance their books and avoid huge debts as a result of excessive spending on players and other expenses. The rule has been hailed as a success by UEFA, but in recent times, some clubs have been accused of flouting the regulation. One such club is Manchester City, which has been embroiled in a long-standing controversy over its financial dealings. The club was fined €30 million and banned from participating in the Champions League for two years by UEFA after it was found guilty of breaching the FFP rule. However, the club appealed the decision and managed to overturn the ban after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Now, the eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League has been thrown into doubt once again due to a small print in the FFP rule. According to reports, the rule states that if any club is found to have breached the FFP rule, it will not only face penalties but also lose its right to appeal against any decision made by UEFA's Adjudicatory Chamber. This has caused concern among the club's supporters, who fear that Manchester City could fall afoul of the rule and lose its right to appeal. The club's manager, Pep Guardiola, has sought to allay fears, saying that he is confident that the club is complying with the FFP rule. However, not everyone is convinced. Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has accused unnamed clubs of engaging in ""dodgy FFP."" He claims that ""major clubs"" are being denied the right to appeal against those clubs that cheat their way to passing the FFP test. The controversy over the FFP rule and Manchester City's eligibility for the Champions League has sparked a wider debate about the regulation itself. Some critics argue that the rule is too restrictive and unfair to clubs that are trying to compete with wealthier rivals. They say that it places an unnecessary burden on clubs and discourages investment in the sport. Others, however, believe that the FFP rule is necessary to promote financial stability and ensure that clubs are not consumed by debt. They argue that without the rule, football could become dominated by a handful of wealthy clubs with limitless resources, which would be detrimental to the sport as a whole. For now, the eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League remains in doubt. The club's supporters will be anxiously watching to see how the situation develops in the coming months, hoping that their team will not be denied the opportunity to compete for one of the biggest prizes in European football.","(573, 22)","Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to

clubs” are away of a potential right to appeal against those who have been found to have cheated their
way to passing the FFP test.
UEFA’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations were introduced in 2011 to prevent clubs from spending
beyond their means. The rules stipulate that clubs must break even over a three-year period, which
means they cannot spend more than they earn.
However, there is a small print in the FFP rule that could affect Manchester City’s eligibility for the
Champions League next season. The rule states that if a club is found to have cheated its way to
passing the FFP test, it can be banned from participating in European competitions for up to four
years. This means that if Manchester City is found to have breached the FFP rules, it could be banned
from participating in the Champions League for up to four years.
Arsenal, Chelsea, and Liverpool could use this small print to challenge Man City’s right to participate in
the Champions League next season. They could argue that Man City has cheated its way to passing the
FFP test and should therefore be banned from competing in European competitions.
Jose Mourinho has also weighed in on the FFP debate, accusing unnamed clubs of using “dodgy”
methods to pass the FFP test. He claimed that “major clubs” are aware of the potential right to appeal
against those who have cheated their way through the FFP process.
Mourinho’s comments come as no surprise, as he has been a vocal critic of the FFP rules in the past.
He has argued that the rules are too strict and unfairly punish clubs that are trying to compete at the
highest level. However, his latest comments suggest that he may be willing to use the small print in
the FFP rule to challenge Man City.
It remains to be seen whether Arsenal, Chelsea, or Liverpool will take action against Man City. However,
if they do, it could have a significant impact on the future of the Champions League.","[(430, 16)]","Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to

Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time
","Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time with their children, saying: ‘You can’t be a great mum and keep working all the time.’ The actress recently put her Hollywood career on hold of 12 months to look after her children ... but with a wealth estimated at about £30 million, she is better placed than most to be able to afford the time off. The 55-year-old said: ‘I wanted to spend more time with my family. Scroll down for video .

I didn’t actually act or write. I was just a mum. ‘I taught drama at my daughter’s school, cooked meals and had fun.

She said: ‘Sometimes in life you’ll have some things, at other times you will have other things. 'You don’t need it all at once, it’s not good for you. ‘Motherhood is a full-time job. 'The only way I could have continued working would have been by delegating the running  of the home to other people. 'I never wanted to do this as I find motherhood profoundly enjoyable.’ The star who recently played Mary Poppins creator P.L. Travers in Saving Mr Banks, also described her husband Greg Wise as ‘a great aesthetic pleasure’. She said: ‘He is the only luxury I can’t imagine ever being able to give up. 'Because he can cook, wash up, clean, entertain children, understand maths homework, put up shelves, take them down and put them up elsewhere and repair the little holes left behind, garden with a purpose, drive sensibly but very fast on motorways and let me get on with my life.

The award-winning actor who has a 14-year-old daughter named Gaia and a 26-year-old adopted son named Tindyebwa Agaba, spoke candidly about her struggles as a working mother in a recent interview. Weisz, who is known for her roles in major blockbusters such as The Mummy and The Constant Gardener, revealed that it has not always been easy for her to find a balance between her professional life and her responsibilities as a parent. The star admitted that there were moments when she had to make tough decisions and even turn down work opportunities because she wanted to ensure that she was there for her children. ""I don't think I've juggled anything. It's about the choices you make,"" Weisz said. ""I've made some films and turned down some films. It's about the decisions you make in your life, which is a balance."" Weisz's daughter, Gaia, was born in 2006, and so far, the actor has managed to keep her family out of the spotlight, a feat that is not often achieved by other high-profile celebrities. The actor, however, revealed that she has intentionally kept her family out of the media, citing the need for privacy and space. The actor further admitted that the entertainment industry can be unforgiving to working parents, especially mothers, who might be seen as less dedicated to their careers. Weisz confessed that she had to take a break from acting to dedicate her time to parenting before returning to the industry with renewed energy. Despite the challenges, Weisz appears to have found a balance between her professional and personal life, while also raising her children to be successful in their chosen paths. Her adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba is a Harvard graduate and a human rights activist, while her daughter Gaia is pursuing her interests in art and design. In conclusion, Rachel Weisz's story is a testament to the challenges that working mothers face, particularly when in the public eye, and how just like any parent, they must make difficult choices, but with the right balance, they can achieve success both in their professional and personal lives.","(425, 15)","Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time

","Dani Vallverdu is to coach Tomas Berdych following his departure from Andy Murray's team. The Venezuelan became friends with Murray during their time together at the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona and had worked with the Scot for the past five years. Murray announced last month that Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green had left the team, describing the split as 'mutual' in a short statement. Dani Vallverdu (right) works with Andy Murray on the practice court at this year's French Open in Paris . Vallverdu's role in Murray's team increased under Ivan Lendl but the 28-year-old found himself taking a step back when Amelie Mauresmo succeeded Lendl as coach in the summer. Vallverdu has wasted no time finding a new job, and landing a lead coaching position with world No 7 Berdych shows the high regard in which he is held. In a statement on his Facebook page, Berdych said: 'Dear fans and friends ...my new coach for next year will be Danny Vallverdu and Azuz Simcich...thank you to Tomas Krupa and David Vydra for great time and fantastic work.' World No 7 Tomas Berdych in action for the Singapore Slammers at the International Premier Tennis League . Berdych began working with fellow Czech Krupa in 2009 but had been searching for a new influence after seeing most of his rivals appoint big-name coaches. Lendl was his number one choice but the eight-time grand slam champion has so far resisted attempts to lure him back into coaching on the tour. It seems very likely, however, that Lendl's appreciation for Vallverdu's talents will have played a part in Berdych's decision. Murray, who is currently at his pre-season training camp in Miami, intends to appoint a replacement for Vallverdu to work alongside Mauresmo . Vallverdu (right) sits in the stands alongside Murray's former coach Ivan Lendl at the 2012 US Open .","(344, 13)","After five years of coaching Andy Murray, Venezuelan tennis coach Dani Vallverdu has officially parted ways with the British No.1. Vallverdu joined Murray's coaching team back in 2010 and played an instrumental role in the Scot's career - particularly during his two Grand Slam wins at the US Open (2012) and Wimbledon (2013). While it may be a difficult farewell for the two, Vallverdu has now ventured onward to new opportunities. It has been announced that he will now coach Czech world No. 7 Tomas Berdych. It was Berdych's previous coach, Tomas Krupa, who dropped the surprising news on Twitter last week. Vallverdu will take over as Berdych's head coach and will start working with him in January. This is a huge coup for Berdych; Vallverdu's experience in coaching high-calibre players speaks for itself. Before working with Murray he was part of Grigor Dimitrov's team and the Bulgarian player saw his ranking go from world No. 60 to No. 8. It's clear that Vallverdu has the ability to develop players and help them elevate their game to the next level. Berdych must be feeling confident about the appointment. A consistent top 10 player for many years now, he's enjoyed some incredible wins such as making the Wimbledon final back in 2010 and reaching the semi-finals of the Australian Open and French Open. But Vallverdu's track record may just be what he needs to get over those final hurdles and possibly even win his first Grand Slam title. As for Murray, there's no official news on who will replace Vallverdu in his coaching team. The British No. 1 has had a tough time of late, failing to reach his previous heights in the ranking and it's no secret that he needs to make some changes in the near future. Whether that change will come in the form of a new coach remains to be seen.","(356, 19)","Dani Vallverdu is to coach Tomas Berdych following his departure from Andy Murray's team. The
