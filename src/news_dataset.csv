Article: Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest","Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest of his Uruguay team-mates on Thursday. England take on Uruguay later this week in what Hart believes is a 'do-or-die' match because of Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Italy. Suarez is back in full training following a knee injury and is expected to start the match at the Itaquerao Stadium. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez looking sharp in training . Prepared: Joe Hart says he is ready for the challenge of Uruguay on Thursday . Suarez enjoyed a prolific year with Liverpool last season, scoring 27 league goals, and Uruguay also have the considerable talents of Diego Forlan and Edinson Cavani to call upon. Hart has been studying videos of all the Uruguay players, though, to make sure he is ready to stop whatever the opposition throws at him on Thursday. 'Dave [Watson, goalkeeping coach] studies the tapes of Uruguay and we are well aware of their strikers and their pattern of finishing,' England's number one told TheFA.com. 'We had a lot of sharp shots around the . box (in training). We cover in general, but we specify short, sharp . shots as they have got a lot of boys who get it out of their feet and . bang it.' England need to beat Uruguay and Costa Rica to guarantee their progression to the knock-out stages. Eyes on the prize: Luis Suarez trained on Tuesday and is expected to be fit to face England . Kicking into gear: Luis Suarez says he is 100 per cent fit to face England after his knee problems . No surprises: Joe Hart has faced Luis Suarez countless times in the Premier League . Head boy: Mario Balotelli (left) scored the winning goal as England lost to Italy last Saturday . A draw and a win could be enough for England to qualify, providing other results go their way, but Hart sees Thursday's game as a must-win. 'We've got to win in Sao Paulo,' said the 27-year-old, who earned his 41st cap in Manaus. 'We did play well (against Italy) and there were a lot of positives, but the outcome was not want we wanted and it's not what we've come here for. 'We've put ourselves in a do-or-die situation, which we are prepared for. We need to win. We didn't go into the Italian game with any intention of losing - it's done now, we've moved on.'","(469, 24)","England goalkeeper Joe Hart has been closely monitoring footage of Uruguay's strikers ahead of their crucial World Cup clash on Thursday. Hart has said that Roy Hodgson's side are fully aware that they must win the match against Uruguay, following their narrow defeat to Italy in their opening game. Hart also revealed that he has been closely studying Uruguay’s forwards, particularly the returning Luis Suarez, who has now resumed full training following an injury. Suarez is expected to start against England, and Hart knows that he and his team-mates will need to be on top form if they are to prevent the world's most in-form striker from finding the net. England's preparations for the Uruguay game have been disrupted by a number of injuries, most notably to captain Steven Gerrard and centre-back Gary Cahill. However, Hart remains confident that Hodgson's side can still secure a crucial victory, despite their injury setbacks. England are also hoping to welcome back Danny Welbeck for the game, after the Manchester United forward missed the opening fixture through injury. Welbeck's pace and energy could prove to be a key asset for England, particularly if they look to exploit the aging Uruguayan defence. However, England will also need to be wary of the threat posed by Uruguay's attacking players, particularly Suarez, who has been in sensational form for Liverpool over the past season. The Liverpool forward, who was named the Premier League's Player of the Year last season, is regarded by many as one of the best strikers in the world. His partnership with Edinson Cavani in particular could prove to be a major problem for England's defence. Despite the challenge facing them, Hart and his team-mates remain determined to secure a much-needed win on Thursday. With the likes of Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Welbeck in their ranks, England certainly have the attacking talent to cause Uruguay problems, and Hart is hopeful that they can produce the goods when it matters most. Of course, everything depends on the form Suarez exibits in the game. If he shows why he is regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, Hart and England’s defence will certainly have a tough time trying to keep him at bay. However, England has some talented forward players, and they will be looking to make the most of the chances that come their way. The match between England and Uruguay promises to be an enthralling encounter, with both sides eager to secure three points and keep their World Cup hopes alive. For Hart and England, it will be a case of remaining focused and organised at the back, while also looking to take advantage of any opportunities that arise in attack.",,,,"Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest of Uruguay's strike force when England take on the South American side in their opening World Cup game on Thursday.
The Manchester City goalkeeper says he has been studying videos of Suarez and Edinson Cavani ahead of the Group D clash at the Estadio Castelao in Fortaleza.
Hodgson's side are aware of the threat posed by the Uruguayan strikers, but Hart is confident he will be able to keep them at bay.
""I've been watching videos of Suarez and Cavani,"" said Hart. ""We know what we're up against. It's going to be a tough game, but we're looking forward to it.""
Suarez is expected to start for Uruguay after recovering from a knee injury that kept him out of his country's final warm-up game against Northern Ireland.
The Liverpool striker has scored 31 goals in all competitions for the Reds this season, while Cavani has netted 18 times for Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1.
However, Hart is not fazed by the prospect of coming up against two of the best strikers in world football.
""I've played against some of the best players in the world over the last few years,"" he said. ""I'm sure I'll be able to deal with Suarez and Cavani.""
England will be hoping to get off to a winning start in their first World Cup game since 2010, when they lost 4-1 to Germany in Bloemfontein.
Hart believes the experience of playing in a major tournament will stand his team in good stead as they look to progress to the knockout stages.
""We've got a lot of players who have played in big games before,"" said the 27-year-old. ""We're looking forward to the challenge and we're confident we can get the result we need.""
England will be without captain Steven Gerrard for the game against Uruguay after the Liverpool midfielder was forced to withdraw from the squad due to a hamstring injury.
Gerrard's absence is a major blow for Hodgson, but the England manager is confident his side can cope without their influential skipper.
""We're disappointed to lose Steven, but we've got a strong squad and we'll be able to cope without him,"" said Hodgson. ""We're focused on the game against Uruguay and we're determined to get a positive result.""
Uruguay will be without striker Diego Forlan for the game against England after the former Manchester United forward was ruled out with a thigh injury.
Forlan has scored 36 goals in 89 appearances for his country, but he will miss out on the chance to add to his tally against England.
Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez is confident his team can cope without Forlan, but he knows they will have to be at their best if they are to beat England.
""It's a big blow to lose Diego, but we have other players who can step up and fill the void,"" said Tabarez. ""We know we'll have to be at our best if we're going to beat England.""","[(587, 24)]","Joe Hart insists he is ready for England's World Cup clash with Uruguay
Joe Hart insists that he is ready to face Uruguay in England's opening World Cup match on Thursday.
The Manchester City goalkeeper has not played for his country since the 2-1 defeat to Germany in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012.
""I've been watching a lot of videos of the Uruguayan strikers,"" he said. ""They've got some very good players.
""It's going to be a tough game, but we're ready for it.
""We know we've got to win the game, and we're going to go out there and give it our best shot.""
Hart has been in fine form for City this season, helping them to the top of the Premier League and into the Champions League semi-finals.
The 27-year-old has been linked with a move to Chelsea, but he insists he is happy at the Etihad Stadium.
""There's been a lot of speculation about my future, but I'm very happy at City,"" he added. ""I'm enjoying my football here, and I'm looking forward to the World Cup.""
England manager Roy Hodgson has been impressed with Hart's form this season.
""He's been playing very well for Manchester City, and I think he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world at the moment,"" said Hodgson. ""We're very lucky to have him in our squad.""
Hodgson is expected to name his starting line-up for the match against Uruguay on Wednesday.
The England manager is likely to stick with the 4-2-3-1 formation that he used in the 1-0 win over Costa Rica in their final warm-up match.
He will be without captain Steven Gerrard, who has been ruled out of the tournament with a hamstring injury.
The Liverpool midfielder will be replaced by Frank Lampard, who will captain the side in Gerrard's absence.
Lampard will be joined in midfield by Jack Wilshere and James Milner, while Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will play on the flanks.
Up front, Wayne Rooney will lead the line, with Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck supporting him.
Uruguay are expected to line up in a 4-4-2 formation, with Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani leading the line.
Diego Forlan and Diego Lugano will play in the centre of defence, while Sebastian Coates and Martin Caceres will play at full-back.

Article: By . Lizzie Parry . Dismayed shoppers in the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells","By . Lizzie Parry . Dismayed shoppers in the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched as upmarket superstore Waitrose opened new branches across Kent. Stores have opened in Edenbridge, Crowborough, Ramsgate and Maidstone while Sevenoaks is preparing for the opening of their second branch. Even 'downmarket' Tonbridge has their own Waitrose, say angry campaigners. Dismayed shoppers in Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched for years as branches of Waitrose have popped up all across Kent. Residents have written to the firm urging them to open in the spa town, but to no avail . The small town of Edenbridge, population 8,000, welcomed their new Waitrose last month. Meanwhile the 56,500 well-to-do residents of Tunbridge Wells are left facing an eight-mile round trip to their nearest branch. Locals have mounted a campaign, writing to Waitrose to demand it opens a store in the spa town. Richard Shaw, 52, said: 'Every time . there is a whisper about a new shop coming to town, everyone gets their . knickers in a twist thinking it will be Waitrose. 'We've waited long enough, I think it's time the store just did the decent thing and opened a store here.' And Sarah Reed, 42, added: 'I've lived her for my entire life and . have seen Waitrose shops pop up all over the county - but never . anything for Tunbridge Wells. The existing branch of Waitrose in Sevenoaks. Locals in neighbouring Royal Tunbridge Wells are fuming that the town is set to welcome a second store in the coming months . Tunbridge Wells resident Richard Shaw, 52, said: 'We've waited long enough, I think it's time the store just did the decent thing and opened a store here.' Pictured is the Waitrose branch in Ramsgate . 'It's . very, very odd - the people here tend to be quite well off and . discerning, exactly the type of customers Waitrose should be aiming at, . but we don't get a look in. 'Even Dartford and Tonbridge have got one and now Sevenoaks will have two - it's very galling.' She said she had written to Waitrose . detailing other stores around the county which had opened and 'politely . requesting' they look at Tunbridge Wells. Local resident Anke, the voice behind The Royal Tunbridge Wells blog, which was launched in 2005, has spent years questioning whether Waitrose will grace the town with their presence. In 2005 he complained the company was 'making us trek to the next town to buy groceries'. A recent post said: 'We have reason for celebration this week, well if you're a shopper that is. 'No, . calm down, Waitrose hasn't arrived yet, but our main shopping centre . has won the prestigious award of ""Best Shopping Centre in the World"".' A Waitrose spokesman said last week: 'I can assure you we're still keen to bring a Waitrose to Tunbridge Wells, however have nothing further to update at the moment.'","(566, 36)","Residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells are expressing their frustration as Waitrose, a high-end supermarket chain, has chosen not to open a store in their town. Despite the recent opening of several branches across Kent, including a second store in Sevenoaks set to open in the coming months, locals in Royal Tunbridge Wells are feeling snubbed. The absence of a Waitrose in Royal Tunbridge Wells has left residents feeling let down. Many locals were hoping for the popular supermarket chain to open a new store in their town, but it appears their wishes have gone unanswered. Scores of residents took to social media to voice their displeasure at the situation. It is not clear why Waitrose has chosen not to open a branch in the town. However, industry insiders speculate that the relatively small population of Royal Tunbridge Wells, compared to the nearby towns of Sevenoaks and Tonbridge, may be a factor. It is also possible that Waitrose may have taken into account the fact that competitors, such as Sainsbury’s and Tesco, already have a presence in the town. Waitrose is a popular supermarket chain in the UK that is known for its high-quality products and customer service. The absence of a Waitrose store in Royal Tunbridge Wells may inconvenience residents who prefer the chain’s products and services. Some locals have expressed their disappointment and frustration at having to travel to nearby towns to shop at Waitrose. Despite the disappointment, some residents are hopeful that Waitrose may reconsider their decision in the future. The opening of a second store in Sevenoaks may indicate that the chain recognizes the potential for growth in the area. It is also possible that local demand for a Waitrose store in Royal Tunbridge Wells may persuade the company to review their decision. For now, residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells will have to make do with the presence of other supermarket chains in the town. However, the continued absence of a Waitrose store may be a missed opportunity for the company to tap into the affluent market in the town. Waitrose is a popular choice among consumers who are willing to pay a premium for high-quality products, and the town’s high-income demographic could be a lucrative market for the chain. In conclusion, the decision by Waitrose not to open a store in Royal Tunbridge Wells has left residents feeling disappointed and frustrated. However, the opening of a second store in Sevenoaks may provide some hope for those hoping for a Waitrose in their town. Only time will tell whether the popular supermarket chain will reconsider their decision and tap into the potential market in Royal Tunbridge Wells.",,,,"By. Lizzie Parry. Dismayed shoppers in Tunbridge Wells have reacted with fury after it was revealed that Waitrose will not be opening a new branch in the town. The supermarket giant has announced plans to open a new store in nearby Sevenoaks, which will be its second branch in the area. However, residents of Tunbridge Wells have expressed their disappointment at the news, with many taking to social media to voice their frustration. One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “I’m absolutely gutted that Waitrose has decided not to open a branch in Tunbridge Wells. We’ve been waiting for years for them to come to our town, and now it looks like we’re going to be left out in the cold.” Another resident, Sarah Smith, said: “It’s really disappointing that Waitrose has chosen to open a new branch in Sevenoaks instead of Tunbridge Wells. Our town has so much to offer, and we deserve a high-quality supermarket like Waitrose.” The news comes as a blow to Tunbridge Wells, which has been struggling to attract new businesses in recent years. The town has seen a number of well-known brands close their doors in recent months, including Marks & Spencer and Debenhams. This has led to concerns that Tunbridge Wells is becoming a “ghost town”, with fewer and fewer people visiting the town centre. However, some residents have expressed hope that the news of Waitrose’s decision will spur other businesses to invest in the town. One resident, John Brown, said: “This is a real wake-up call for Tunbridge Wells. If we want to attract more businesses to our town, we need to do more to make it an attractive place to live and work. We need to invest in our infrastructure, improve our public transport links, and create more jobs.” It remains to be seen whether Tunbridge Wells will be able to bounce back from this latest setback. However, many residents are determined to fight for their town and ensure that it remains a vibrant and thriving community.","[(392, 15)]","By . Lizzie Dearden .

Article: (CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by","(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by 12 months until June 2012, killing off speculation that he could be on his way to Real Madrid. Coach Mourinho has signed an extended deal ending fears he could wave goodbye to Inter Milan. Former Chelsea supremo Mourinho took charge at Italian giants Inter a year ago following the departure of Roberto Mancini and has just guided the club to their fourth straight scudetto. They also won the Italian Super Cup, but were eliminated by defending champions Manchester United in the first knockout round of the Champions League. A statement on the Inter Web site read: ""In response to the wish of the coach to continue the project started together a year ago, a wish welcomed with pleasure by the club as a sign of attachment and winning spirit, FC Internazionale announces the extension of Jose Mourinho's contract until 30 June 2012."" Mourinho had promised the fans more titles would be on the after lifting his first Italian title, but the eal issue refused to go away until Monday's statement. When asked about the chance he could leave Inter, Mourinho had earlier told the club Web site: ""There is still a 0.01% (chance). But for me this is not an important number, it just means that I am closer to Inter than to Real. ""I am satisfied with the relationship with the fans and with my players. I repeat, I am closer to staying at Inter than going elsewhere."" Those comments failed to impress Inter president Massimo Moratti, but the extended contract has settled any differences. Mourinho made his mark at Porto in 2004 when he led the Portuguese team to the Champions League title, beating Monaco 3-0 in the final, before moving to Chelsea. At Stamford Bridge he claimed the Premier League title in each of his first two seasons and the FA Cup the following campaign, but left the club in September 2007. Not all Inter fans have warmed to the Portuguese since his arrival in Milan last summer. He has been involved in several disagreements with the Italian media and his style of play has has not endeared him to parts of the Nerazzurri faithful.","(414, 15)","It's official: Jose Mourinho will remain at the helm of Inter Milan for another couple of years. The Portuguese coach has put pen to paper on a new contract that keeps him at the Italian club until at least 30 June 2012. The decision to extend Mourinho's stay puts an end to months of speculation that he could be lured away to Spanish giants Real Madrid. With the 2008-2009 season culminating in a Serie A, Coppa Italia and Champions League triumph for the Italian club, Mourinho was already being recognized as one of the best coaches in the world. But as rumours swirled about his potential exit to Real Madrid, many Inter fans feared that this glorious chapter in the club's history might come to a premature end. Fortunately for the Nerazzurri faithful, Mourinho has apparently found everything he needs at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. ""I'm happy to confirm that I've signed an extension to my contract with Inter,"" he said in a statement. ""I have a great relationship with both the club and the fans, and I'm excited about the challenges that lie ahead."" Under Mourinho's leadership, Inter Milan have become a force to be reckoned with in Italian and European football. The Special One, as he likes to call himself, has raised the bar for Inter's domestic rivals, and has instilled a winning mentality in his players that was previously lacking. The result has been a remarkable run of success which could yet extend further, with Inter looking to defend their titles in Serie A, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League. The news that Mourinho will not be leaving for Real Madrid will come as a tremendous relief for Inter supporters. For many, the prospect of losing a coach of Mourinho's stature and pedigree was simply unthinkable. Now, with the Portuguese mastermind committed to staying in Milan, the club can look forward to a bright future and more success under his guidance. It remains to be seen, however, whether Mourinho's decision to stay with Inter will put an end to the speculation about his future. The rumour mill never sleeps, and other elite clubs may well be looking enviously at what the Portuguese coach has achieved in Italy. For now though, Inter Milan can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that their Special One will be with them for the foreseeable future.",,,,"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract as head coach of Inter Milan until 2012, killing off speculation that he might be on his way back to Real Madrid.
Mourinho, who led Inter to their first Serie A title in seven years last season, had been linked with a return to the Bernabeu, where he won two La Liga titles and the Champions League in three seasons before leaving in 2007.
""Jose Mourinho has signed a new contract with Inter which will keep him at the club until June 30, 2012,"" the club said in a statement on its official website.
The 47-year-old Portuguese coach took over at Inter in May 2008, replacing Roberto Mancini, who left to take charge of Manchester City.
Mourinho's first season in charge saw Inter finish second in Serie A behind Juventus, who were later stripped of the title for their part in the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal.
Inter went on to win the Champions League in 2010, beating Bayern Munich 2-0 in the final thanks to goals from Diego Milito and Wesley Sneijder.
The Nerazzurri also won the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana last season, and are currently top of the Serie A table after 10 games.
Mourinho has won league titles in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain during his career, and is widely regarded as one of the best managers in the world.
He has also won the Champions League twice, with Porto in 2004 and Inter in 2010.
Mourinho is known for his tactical acumen and his ability to get the best out of his players, but he has also been criticized for his confrontational style and his tendency to make controversial comments.
Despite his success, Mourinho has never won the FIFA World Coach of the Year award, which is considered the highest honor for a manager.
However, he has been nominated for the award on several occasions, and many believe that he is one of the favorites to win it in the future.
With his new contract in place, Mourinho will now focus on leading Inter to more success in the coming seasons.
The club have already qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League, and they will be hoping to go all the way and win the trophy again this year.
Mourinho will also be looking to lead Inter to another Serie A title, and he will be determined to prove that he is still one of the best coaches in the world.

A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning. Blanc Brasserie in London's Covent Garden has been forbidden from offering pink lamb's liver after ignoring a warning from Westminster Council environmental health officers. The food presented an 'imminent risk of injury to health' because of the way it was cooked, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told today. French-born Mr Blanc, 62, is a director of the company that owns the restaurant. James Armitage, Westminster City Council's food, health and safety manager, said: 'After receiving two separate complaints of food poisoning which may have originated from eating at a Covent Garden restaurant, our officers investigated and issued a notice which prevented the restaurant from serving undercooked lambs' liver. 'Today's court decision to uphold the notice is welcome as the serving of undercooked meat, without suitable controls in place, is a public health risk. 'Health inspectors have agreed with the restaurant the safety measures that need to be in place for the restaurant to be allowed to safely put the dish back on its menu.' The two diners contracted campylobacter food poisoning after they had the dish on separate occasions this summer. Guidance from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) recommends that lamb's liver must be cooked at 70 degrees centigrade for at least two minutes. But the Brasserie Bar Co. said it had taken liver off the menu at all 18 of its Blanc Brasserie restaurants throughout Britain after it was ordered to pay £3,103 in costs. A spokeswoman said: 'Brasserie Bar Co. has not contested the environmental health officers' enforcement and will no longer serve liver in any of its restaurants. 'In order to serve liver and comply with Westminster Council, it would need to be overcooked to such an extent that our customers just won't eat it.' Mr Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons restaurant in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, was awarded two Michelin stars in 1985. There were more than 371,000 estimated cases of campylobacter food poisoning in England and Wales in 2009, resulting in more than 17,500 hospitalisations and 88 deaths, according to the FSA.

Instead, the restaurant's management chose to carry on business as usual, putting the health and safety of their customers at risk. The situation at Blanc Brasserie has raised concerns among food safety experts, who warn that ignoring warnings from environmental health officers can have serious consequences. According to experts, failing to take prompt action can lead to the spread of foodborne illness among customers, potentially causing long-lasting health problems and possible legal action. The situation at Blanc Brasserie is particularly concerning given the restaurant's high-end reputation and status as a popular destination for foodies in London. Many of the restaurant's customers are passionate about their food and expect a top-quality dining experience, which includes food safety and hygiene standards that are beyond reproach. Raymond Blanc is a well-known figure in the culinary world, having appeared on numerous TV shows and written several cookbooks. He is also a staunch advocate for sustainable and ethical food practices. The fact that his restaurant seemingly ignored warnings from environmental health officers has raised eyebrows among his fans and supporters. Although the restaurant has not yet issued a statement about the situation, it is likely that the management will face significant backlash from customers and food safety advocates alike. It remains to be seen what steps they will take to rectify the issues raised by the environmental health officers. This incident serves as a reminder to all restaurants and food establishments about the importance of prioritizing food safety and hygiene. Ignoring warnings from experts can have serious health and legal repercussions, which can ultimately harm not only customers but businesses themselves. It is crucial that all food establishments take proactive measures to ensure that their products are safe and healthy for consumption.",,,,"By. Leon Watson.

A Michelin-starred restaurant has been shut down after two diners fell ill with food poisoning.
Blanc Brasserie in London’s Covent Garden was ordered to close by environmental health officers after two diners were struck down with campylobacter – a type of bacteria that can cause diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever.
The restaurant, which is owned by celebrity chef Marco Pierre White, was served with a hygiene emergency prohibition notice by Westminster City Council on January 29.
The closure notice, seen by MailOnline, states that the restaurant ‘poses an imminent risk of injury to health’.
It adds: ‘There is a risk of cross-contamination between raw and ready-to-eat foods due to poor design and layout of the kitchen.
‘There is a lack of separation between raw and ready to eat foods.’
The notice also states that there is a lack of hand washing facilities in the kitchen and that staff are not washing their hands before handling food.
It adds that there is a ‘lack of effective cleaning and disinfection of equipment and utensils’ and that there is ‘poor personal hygiene of staff’.
The closure notice states that the restaurant must remain closed until the council is satisfied that it is no longer a risk to public health.
A spokesman for Westminster City Council said: ‘Westminster City Council’s environmental health officers visited the restaurant on January 29 after receiving a complaint from two diners who had fallen ill after eating at the restaurant.
‘As a result of our investigation, we served the restaurant with an emergency prohibition notice under the Food Safety and Hygiene (England) Regulations 2013.
‘The notice requires the restaurant to remain closed until we are satisfied that it no longer poses an imminent risk to public health.’
A spokesman for Marco Pierre White added: ‘We are aware of the situation and are working with the local authority to resolve the matter as quickly as possible.’
Campylobacter is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in the UK, with around 280,000 cases reported each year.
Symptoms usually develop within two to five days of eating contaminated food and last between two and 10 days.
Most people make a full recovery without treatment, but severe cases can lead to complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition that affects the nervous system.
Campylobacter can be found in raw or undercooked meat, particularly poultry, as well as unpasteurised milk and untreated water.
It can also be spread through contact with animal faeces, so people should always wash their hands thoroughly after touching animals or their droppings.","[(504, 19)]","By . Leon Watson . Published: 12:00, Wed, Jan 13, 2021 | Updated: 13:00, Thu, Jan 14, 2020 .

Blanc Brasserie in Covent Garden, central London, has been ordered to pay more than £100,000 in fines and costs after two diners contracted food poisoning.
Two diners had complained to environmental health officers that they had become ill after eating at the restaurant, which is owned by French-born celebrity chef Marco Pierre White.
The two diners, who had eaten at the restaurant in November 2019, had complained of stomach cramps and diarrhoea.
Marco Pierre White is a celebrity chef and restaurateur. He was born in France and moved to the UK in the 1970s, where he worked as a chef at the Hyde Park Hotel in London. In 1987, he opened his first restaurant, Harvey’s, in London’s Soho district. In 1993, he became the first British chef to be awarded three Michelin stars for his restaurant, the Mirabelle, in Bray, Berkshire.
In 1999, he was awarded an OBE for his services to the hospitality industry. In 2000, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to gastronomy. In 2010, he won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Catey Awards.
The restaurant was ordered to pay a fine of £50,000 and costs of £60,000 by Westminster Magistrates’ Court.
The court heard that the two diners had eaten a three-course meal at the restaurant on the evening of November 8, 2019.
They had ordered a starter, a main course and a dessert, and had also ordered a bottle of wine.
After they had finished their meal, the two diners complained to the environmental health officers, who visited the restaurant the following day.
The environmental health officers found that the restaurant had failed to comply with the Food Safety and Hygiene Regulations 2013.
They found that the food had not been prepared in a clean and hygienic manner, and that it had not been cooked to the correct temperature.
They also found that the kitchen had not been cleaned properly, and that there was a risk of cross-contamination.
They ordered the restaurant to pay the fine and costs, and to pay a further £10,000 in compensation to the two diners.
The fine and costs were imposed under the Food Safety Act 2013, which came into force in April 2014.
The compensation was imposed under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008.
The case was brought by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which is responsible for enforcing food safety laws in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The FSA said that it had taken action against the restaurant because it had failed to meet its legal obligations.
It said that the restaurant’s failure to comply with food safety regulations had put the health and safety of its customers at risk.
The agency said that it would continue to take action against restaurants that failed to meet their legal obligations.","[(561, 27)]"

The box contained six eggs of different flavoured chocolates, including salted caramel, raspberry ripple, and dark chocolate, among others. The variety of flavours and the high-quality chocolate used in each egg made it an exceptional entry.

The judges praised all the entries in the competition, both for their creative designs and delicious taste. They emphasized the importance of not only using high-quality ingredients but also presenting an innovative design that stood out in a saturated market.

A 9-year-old boy has his feet severed while attempting to climb onto a passing train in St. Paul, Minnesota. Around 5:30pm Thursday evening, neighbors witnessed Marshawn Farr-Robinson trying to climb the ladder of a slow moving train. He slipped and the train rolled over his feet. Marshawn was spotted by 13-year-old Thomas Thornton who saw the boy crawling, and thought he looked hurt. Railroad accident: Marshawn Farr-Robinson was attempting to climb onto a slow-moving train when he tripped and his feet were cut off . He asked his dad, Dave Thornton, to go check on him and the man found the boy crawling out of the weeds near the tracks with both feet missing. Mr Thornton grabbed the severed feet and wrapped them in a t-shirt hoping doctors might be able to reattach them. He was surprised by how calm the boy was. He seemed more concerned about someone finding and telling his mother more than anything else. Mr Thornton's 15-year-old daughter stayed with the boy while her Dad got help. 'I kept asking him what his name was, what his birthday was. He answered everything. I was amazed at how alert he was. It's a miracle,' Jane Thornton told KSTP. Neighbors to the rescue: 13-year-old Thomas Thornton, left, was the first to notice Marshawn. His sister Jane, right, comforted the boy while her father ran to get help . When emergency responders arrived, they immediately applied tourniquets to both of Marshawn's legs. Marshawn was taken to Gillette Children's Hospital where he is currently recovering. Marshawn's condition is unclear, as his family have asked for privacy. People - children, especially - cross the tracks all the time according to long-time resident Barb Evertz. She told the Star Tribune it's an 'ongoing thing' and that trains blow their horns louder when somebody is on the tracks. She proposes fencing the tracks off. Solution? Residents say the train tracks are an ongoing problem with kids crossing them all the time. Some believe the tracks should be fenced off .","(412, 32)","In a tragic incident, 9-year-old Marshawn Farr-Robinson lost both his feet after attempting to climb onto a slow-moving train in his neighborhood. According to eyewitnesses, Marshawn was seen trying to jump onto the train when he slipped and his feet got caught under the train's wheels. Neighbors rushed to Marshawn's rescue and immediately called for an ambulance. The young boy was rushed to the Gillette Children's Hospital for emergency medical attention. The hospital staff, including a team of experienced emergency doctors and nurses, were quick to respond to the situation. They provided Marshawn with immediate medical attention to stabilize his condition and address the extent of his injuries. While the exact nature of Marshawn's condition is unknown, his family has requested privacy during this difficult time. The hospital staff assured that they are doing everything in their power to provide the young boy with the best possible care and support. The incident has left the community in shock and disbelief. Marshawn is beloved in his neighborhood, and many have expressed their sympathy and support for him and his family. Local authorities are investigating the incident to determine the exact cause and potential safety issues associated with the train yard. The police have also urged parents to educate their children about the dangers of playing near train tracks and rail yards. The incident is a sobering reminder of the potential hazards that children can face while playing in their communities. It highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance when it comes to ensuring the safety of our children. Our thoughts and prayers are with Marshawn, his family, and the local community during this difficult time. We hope that he will recover soon and receive the care and support that he needs to make a full recovery.",,,,"Your role is a professional news journalist.

Article: Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to","Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to play in the Champions League next season. The rules now effectively set up a scenario where rivals can claim City have cheated their way to passing UEFA’s ‘Financial Fair Play’ (FFP) test. It is understood lawyers for a host of ‘major clubs’ are aware of these potential rights to make appeals — thanks to recently amended Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations — and are monitoring the situation closely. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho question the fairness of FFP . Expensive squad: But could Manchester City's big-spending ways cost them a Champions League place? On Saturday night Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who faces City on Monday in the game of the season so far, accused some unnamed clubs of ‘dodgy FFP’. He said: ‘There are clubs that are following exactly the project of Financial Fair Play and there are other clubs doing it in a dodgy way. For me, that is very clear. I don’t say the clubs — that is not my job.’ When asked specifically about City, and a potential UEFA investigation, he added: ‘It’s for Mr Platini and other people to analyse it, it’s not for me… I’m waiting for that.’ Financial force: Manchester City's spending power is among the greatest in football . 'Dodgy FFP'? Jose Mourinho was critical, but he manages another expensive squad at Chelsea . Concern? Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has a proven track record in the Champions League . FFP rules compel clubs to limit losses for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons combined to £37million, with a ban from European competitions the severest theoretical punishment. City last week announced losses for 2012-13 of £51.6m, meaning they have lost £149.5m over two years. They can perhaps ‘exempt’ as much as £110m of those losses to meet FFP requirements. But they face accusations their losses are artificially low after earning cash from ‘intellectual property’ sales to related companies. UEFA sources have confirmed this will be investigated to see if it is ‘real’ income. Amended small print in the 2014 UEFA FFP rulebook, just published, includes two key changes; one allowing clubs to ‘plea bargain’ punishments for overspending, and another that allows other clubs to challenge those plea bargains if they feel the outcomes negatively affect them. Time to celebrate? Liverpool are one of the clubs not in a position to compete with City's financial muscle . Title rivals: Arsenal could be another team to benefit if City are to face a form of punishment . Money well spent: The signings of players like Sergio Aguero have turned City into a real force .","(520, 23)","The eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League has been thrown into doubt due to a small print in the Financial Fair Play (FFP) rule of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). This has caused concern among the club's supporters, who are worried about the possibility of their beloved team being disqualified from the coveted tournament. The FFP was established to promote financial stability and fair competition among football clubs in Europe. It requires clubs to balance their books and avoid huge debts as a result of excessive spending on players and other expenses. The rule has been hailed as a success by UEFA, but in recent times, some clubs have been accused of flouting the regulation. One such club is Manchester City, which has been embroiled in a long-standing controversy over its financial dealings. The club was fined €30 million and banned from participating in the Champions League for two years by UEFA after it was found guilty of breaching the FFP rule. However, the club appealed the decision and managed to overturn the ban after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Now, the eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League has been thrown into doubt once again due to a small print in the FFP rule. According to reports, the rule states that if any club is found to have breached the FFP rule, it will not only face penalties but also lose its right to appeal against any decision made by UEFA's Adjudicatory Chamber. This has caused concern among the club's supporters, who fear that Manchester City could fall afoul of the rule and lose its right to appeal. The club's manager, Pep Guardiola, has sought to allay fears, saying that he is confident that the club is complying with the FFP rule. However, not everyone is convinced. Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has accused unnamed clubs of engaging in ""dodgy FFP."" He claims that ""major clubs"" are being denied the right to appeal against those clubs that cheat their way to passing the FFP test. The controversy over the FFP rule and Manchester City's eligibility for the Champions League has sparked a wider debate about the regulation itself. Some critics argue that the rule is too restrictive and unfair to clubs that are trying to compete with wealthier rivals. They say that it places an unnecessary burden on clubs and discourages investment in the sport. Others, however, believe that the FFP rule is necessary to promote financial stability and ensure that clubs are not consumed by debt. They argue that without the rule, football could become dominated by a handful of wealthy clubs with limitless resources, which would be detrimental to the sport as a whole. For now, the eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League remains in doubt. The club's supporters will be anxiously watching to see how the situation develops in the coming months, hoping that their team will not be denied the opportunity to compete for one of the biggest prizes in European football.",,,,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta tests positive for COVID-19
Mikel Arteta, the manager of Arsenal Football Club, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the club announced on Wednesday. The 37-year-old Spaniard is the first Premier League manager to test positive for the virus, which has infected more than 200,000 people around the world and killed more than 8,000.
Arsenal said in a statement that Arteta was showing ""mild symptoms"" and was self-isolating at home. The club added that it would be contacting players and staff who had recently been in close contact with Arteta.
Arteta took over as Arsenal manager in December after Unai Emery was sacked. He led the club to a fifth-place finish in the Premier League last season, missing out on a spot in the Champions League by just one point.
The Premier League has suspended all matches until at least April 4 due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The league is scheduled to resume on April 3, but that date could be pushed back further if the situation does not improve.
Arteta is the latest high-profile figure to be diagnosed with COVID-19. Earlier this week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that he had tested positive for the virus. Other notable figures who have tested positive include US President Donald Trump, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
The spread of COVID-19 has caused widespread disruption around the world. Schools and businesses have been closed, events have been cancelled, and travel has been restricted. The virus has also had a significant impact on the sports world, with many leagues and tournaments being postponed or cancelled.
Arteta's positive test is a reminder of the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus is highly contagious and can be fatal, especially for those with underlying health conditions. It is important for everyone to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, such as washing their hands frequently, avoiding close contact with others, and staying home if they are feeling sick.
Arsenal will be hoping that Arteta makes a full recovery and is able to return to work soon. In the meantime, the club will be relying on assistant manager Freddie Ljungberg to lead the team. Ljungberg is a former Arsenal player who has been with the club since 2017. He has experience as a manager, having led the club's under-23 team to the Premier League 2 title in 2019.
Arsenal's next match is scheduled for March 21, when they are due to play at home against Manchester City. It is unclear whether the match will go ahead as planned, or whether it will be postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak.","[(496, 23)]","Your role is a professional news journalist.

Article: Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time","Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time with their children, saying: ‘You can’t be a great mum and keep working all the time.’ The actress recently put her Hollywood career on hold of 12 months to look after her children ... but with a wealth estimated at about £30 million, she is better placed than most to be able to afford the time off. The 55-year-old said: ‘I wanted to spend more time with my family. Scroll down for video .

I didn’t actually act or write. I was just a mum. ‘I taught drama at my daughter’s school, cooked meals and had fun. 'I highly recommend others to do the same if they can afford it.’ The star who recently played Mary Poppins creator P.L.

The Love Actually actress – who has a 14-year-old daughter, Gaia, and a 26-year-old adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba – said she had come to the conclusion that it wasn’t always possible to juggle parenthood and a career.

'The only way I could have continued working would have been by delegating the running  of the home to other people. 'I never wanted to do this as I find motherhood profoundly enjoyable.’ The star who recently played Mary Poppins creator P.L. Travers in Saving Mr Banks, also described her husband Greg Wise as ‘a great aesthetic pleasure’. She said: ‘He is the only luxury I can’t imagine ever being able to give up. 'Because he can cook, wash up, clean, entertain children, understand maths homework, put up shelves, take them down and put them up elsewhere and repair the little holes left behind, garden with a purpose, drive sensibly but very fast on motorways and let me get on with my life. 'A year off was my birthday present to myself. I didn't actually act or write. I was just a mum': Emma with her adopted son in 2008 .","(512, 23)","Celebrity parent, Rachel Weisz has opened up about the challenges she has faced when it comes to balancing motherhood and her successful acting career. The award-winning actor who has a 14-year-old daughter named Gaia and a 26-year-old adopted son named Tindyebwa Agaba, spoke candidly about her struggles as a working mother in a recent interview. Weisz, who is known for her roles in major blockbusters such as The Mummy and The Constant Gardener, revealed that it has not always been easy for her to find a balance between her professional life and her responsibilities as a parent. The star admitted that there were moments when she had to make tough decisions and even turn down work opportunities because she wanted to ensure that she was there for her children. ""I don't think I've juggled anything. It's about the choices you make,"" Weisz said. ""I've made some films and turned down some films. It's about the decisions you make in your life, which is a balance."" Weisz's daughter, Gaia, was born in 2006, and so far, the actor has managed to keep her family out of the spotlight, a feat that is not often achieved by other high-profile celebrities. The actor, however, revealed that she has intentionally kept her family out of the media, citing the need for privacy and space. The actor further admitted that the entertainment industry can be unforgiving to working parents, especially mothers, who might be seen as less dedicated to their careers. Weisz confessed that she had to take a break from acting to dedicate her time to parenting before returning to the industry with renewed energy. Despite the challenges, Weisz appears to have found a balance between her professional and personal life, while also raising her children to be successful in their chosen paths. Her adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba is a Harvard graduate and a human rights activist, while her daughter Gaia is pursuing her interests in art and design. In conclusion, Rachel Weisz's story is a testament to the challenges that working mothers face, particularly when in the public eye, and how just like any parent, they must make difficult choices, but with the right balance, they can achieve success both in their professional and personal lives.",,,,"Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to care for their children, saying she regrets not being able to spend more time with her two children when they were young.
The Oscar-winning actress, 61, who has an adopted son and a biological daughter, said she felt guilty about not being able to give them the attention they deserved.
She said: “I wish I could have taken a year off when my kids were little. I wish I could have spent more time with them.”
Thompson, who has been married to actor Greg Wise since 2003, said she felt like she was “missing out” on important moments in her children’s lives.
She added: “I felt like I was missing out on so much. I felt like I was letting them down.”
Thompson said she now tries to make up for lost time by spending as much time as possible with her children, who are now in their 20s.
“I try to make up for it now,” she said. “I try to spend as much time with them as I can. But it’s never going to be enough.”
Thompson’s comments come as the debate over parental leave continues to rage in the UK.
The government recently announced plans to introduce a new system of shared parental leave, which would allow parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay after the birth or adoption of a child.
However, critics have argued that the new system does not go far enough, and that more needs to be done to support working parents.
Thompson’s comments are likely to add fuel to the debate, as she is one of the most high-profile celebrities to speak out on the issue.
Her comments are also likely to resonate with many working parents, who often feel torn between their careers and their families.
It remains to be seen what impact Thompson’s comments will have on the debate, but it is clear that the issue of parental leave is one that is likely to continue to be debated for some time to come.","[(403, 14)]","Your role is a professional news journalist.

The Venezuelan became friends with Murray during their time together at the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona and had worked with the Scot for the past five years. Murray announced last month that Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green had left the team, describing the split as 'mutual' in a short statement. Dani Vallverdu (right) works with Andy Murray on the practice court at this year's French Open in Paris . Vallverdu's role in Murray's team increased under Ivan Lendl but the 28-year-old found himself taking a step back when Amelie Mauresmo succeeded Lendl as coach in the summer. Vallverdu has wasted no time finding a new job, and landing a lead coaching position with world No 7 Berdych shows the high regard in which he is held. In a statement on his Facebook page, Berdych said: 'Dear fans and friends ...my new coach for next year will be Danny Vallverdu and Azuz Simcich...thank you to Tomas Krupa and David Vydra for great time and fantastic work.' World No 7 Tomas Berdych in action for the Singapore Slammers at the International Premier Tennis League . Berdych began working with fellow Czech Krupa in 2009 but had been searching for a new influence after seeing most of his rivals appoint big-name coaches. Lendl was his number one choice but the eight-time grand slam champion has so far resisted attempts to lure him back into coaching on the tour. It seems very likely, however, that Lendl's appreciation for Vallverdu's talents will have played a part in Berdych's decision. Murray, who is currently at his pre-season training camp in Miami, intends to appoint a replacement for Vallverdu to work alongside Mauresmo . Vallverdu (right) sits in the stands alongside Murray's former coach Ivan Lendl at the 2012 US Open .","(344, 13)","After five years of coaching Andy Murray, Venezuelan tennis coach Dani Vallverdu has officially parted ways with the British No.1. Vallverdu joined Murray's coaching team back in 2010 and played an instrumental role in the Scot's career - particularly during his two Grand Slam wins at the US Open (2012) and Wimbledon (2013). While it may be a difficult farewell for the two, Vallverdu has now ventured onward to new opportunities. It has been announced that he will now coach Czech world No. 7 Tomas Berdych. It was Berdych's previous coach, Tomas Krupa, who dropped the surprising news on Twitter last week. Vallverdu will take over as Berdych's head coach and will start working with him in January. This is a huge coup for Berdych; Vallverdu's experience in coaching high-calibre players speaks for itself. Before working with Murray he was part of Grigor Dimitrov's team and the Bulgarian player saw his ranking go from world No. 60 to No. 8. It's clear that Vallverdu has the ability to develop players and help them elevate their game to the next level. Berdych must be feeling confident about the appointment. A consistent top 10 player for many years now, he's enjoyed some incredible wins such as making the Wimbledon final back in 2010 and reaching the semi-finals of the Australian Open and French Open. But Vallverdu's track record may just be what he needs to get over those final hurdles and possibly even win his first Grand Slam title. As for Murray, there's no official news on who will replace Vallverdu in his coaching team. The British No. 1 has had a tough time of late, failing to reach his previous heights in the ranking and it's no secret that he needs to make some changes in the near future. Whether that change will come in the form of a new coach remains to be seen.",,,,"Dani Vallverdu is to coach Tomas Berdych following his departure from Andy Murray's team

Berdych, who is currently ranked seventh in the world, has been looking for a new coach since parting ways with his previous coach, Jiri Vanek, earlier this year.
""I am very excited to be joining Tomas Berdych's team,"" Vallverdu said in a statement. ""Tomas is a great player and I am looking forward to working with him and helping him achieve his goals.""
Berdych also expressed his excitement about working with Vallverdu.
""I am very happy to have Dani Vallverdu as my new coach,"" Berdych said. ""He is a very experienced coach and I am confident that he will help me take my game to the next level.""
Vallverdu's departure from Murray's team came as a surprise to many, as he had been a key member of the team for several years.
Murray thanked Vallverdu for his contributions to his career and wished him well in his new role.

The appointment of Vallverdu as Berdych's new coach comes at a crucial time for the Czech player, as he prepares to defend his title at the ATP World Tour Finals in London later this year.
