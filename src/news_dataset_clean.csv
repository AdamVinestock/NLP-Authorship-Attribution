Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest
","Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest of his Uruguay team-mates on Thursday. England take on Uruguay later this week in what Hart believes is a 'do-or-die' match because of Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Italy. Suarez is back in full training following a knee injury and is expected to start the match at the Itaquerao Stadium. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez looking sharp in training . Prepared: Joe Hart says he is ready for the challenge of Uruguay on Thursday . Suarez enjoyed a prolific year with Liverpool last season, scoring 27 league goals, and Uruguay also have the considerable talents of Diego Forlan and Edinson Cavani to call upon. Hart has been studying videos of all the Uruguay players, though, to make sure he is ready to stop whatever the opposition throws at him on Thursday. 'Dave [Watson, goalkeeping coach] studies the tapes of Uruguay and we are well aware of their strikers and their pattern of finishing,' England's number one told TheFA.com. 'We had a lot of sharp shots around the . box (in training). We cover in general, but we specify short, sharp . shots as they have got a lot of boys who get it out of their feet and . bang it.' England need to beat Uruguay and Costa Rica to guarantee their progression to the knock-out stages. Eyes on the prize: Luis Suarez trained on Tuesday and is expected to be fit to face England . Kicking into gear: Luis Suarez says he is 100 per cent fit to face England after his knee problems . No surprises: Joe Hart has faced Luis Suarez countless times in the Premier League . Head boy: Mario Balotelli (left) scored the winning goal as England lost to Italy last Saturday . A draw and a win could be enough for England to qualify, providing other results go their way, but Hart sees Thursday's game as a must-win. 'We've got to win in Sao Paulo,' said the 27-year-old, who earned his 41st cap in Manaus. 'We did play well (against Italy) and there were a lot of positives, but the outcome was not want we wanted and it's not what we've come here for. 'We've put ourselves in a do-or-die situation, which we are prepared for. We need to win. We didn't go into the Italian game with any intention of losing - it's done now, we've moved on.'","(469, 24)","England goalkeeper Joe Hart has been closely monitoring footage of Uruguay's strikers ahead of their crucial World Cup clash on Thursday. Hart has said that Roy Hodgson's side are fully aware that they must win the match against Uruguay, following their narrow defeat to Italy in their opening game. Hart also revealed that he has been closely studying Uruguay’s forwards, particularly the returning Luis Suarez, who has now resumed full training following an injury. Suarez is expected to start against England, and Hart knows that he and his team-mates will need to be on top form if they are to prevent the world's most in-form striker from finding the net. England's preparations for the Uruguay game have been disrupted by a number of injuries, most notably to captain Steven Gerrard and centre-back Gary Cahill. However, Hart remains confident that Hodgson's side can still secure a crucial victory, despite their injury setbacks. England are also hoping to welcome back Danny Welbeck for the game, after the Manchester United forward missed the opening fixture through injury. Welbeck's pace and energy could prove to be a key asset for England, particularly if they look to exploit the aging Uruguayan defence. However, England will also need to be wary of the threat posed by Uruguay's attacking players, particularly Suarez, who has been in sensational form for Liverpool over the past season. The Liverpool forward, who was named the Premier League's Player of the Year last season, is regarded by many as one of the best strikers in the world. His partnership with Edinson Cavani in particular could prove to be a major problem for England's defence. Despite the challenge facing them, Hart and his team-mates remain determined to secure a much-needed win on Thursday. With the likes of Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Welbeck in their ranks, England certainly have the attacking talent to cause Uruguay problems, and Hart is hopeful that they can produce the goods when it matters most. Of course, everything depends on the form Suarez exibits in the game. If he shows why he is regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, Hart and England’s defence will certainly have a tough time trying to keep him at bay. However, England has some talented forward players, and they will be looking to make the most of the chances that come their way. The match between England and Uruguay promises to be an enthralling encounter, with both sides eager to secure three points and keep their World Cup hopes alive. For Hart and England, it will be a case of remaining focused and organised at the back, while also looking to take advantage of any opportunities that arise in attack.","(507, 18)","Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest

By . Lizzie Parry . Dismayed shoppers in the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells
","By . Lizzie Parry . Dismayed shoppers in the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched as upmarket superstore Waitrose opened new branches across Kent. Stores have opened in Edenbridge, Crowborough, Ramsgate and Maidstone while Sevenoaks is preparing for the opening of their second branch. Even 'downmarket' Tonbridge has their own Waitrose, say angry campaigners. Dismayed shoppers in Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched for years as branches of Waitrose have popped up all across Kent. Residents have written to the firm urging them to open in the spa town, but to no avail . The small town of Edenbridge, population 8,000, welcomed their new Waitrose last month. Meanwhile the 56,500 well-to-do residents of Tunbridge Wells are left facing an eight-mile round trip to their nearest branch. Locals have mounted a campaign, writing to Waitrose to demand it opens a store in the spa town. Richard Shaw, 52, said: 'Every time . there is a whisper about a new shop coming to town, everyone gets their . knickers in a twist thinking it will be Waitrose. 'We've waited long enough, I think it's time the store just did the decent thing and opened a store here.' And Sarah Reed, 42, added: 'I've lived her for my entire life and . have seen Waitrose shops pop up all over the county - but never . anything for Tunbridge Wells. The existing branch of Waitrose in Sevenoaks. Locals in neighbouring Royal Tunbridge Wells are fuming that the town is set to welcome a second store in the coming months . Tunbridge Wells resident Richard Shaw, 52, said: 'We've waited long enough, I think it's time the store just did the decent thing and opened a store here.' Pictured is the Waitrose branch in Ramsgate . 'It's . very, very odd - the people here tend to be quite well off and . discerning, exactly the type of customers Waitrose should be aiming at, . but we don't get a look in. 'Even Dartford and Tonbridge have got one and now Sevenoaks will have two - it's very galling.' She said she had written to Waitrose . detailing other stores around the county which had opened and 'politely . requesting' they look at Tunbridge Wells. Local resident Anke, the voice behind The Royal Tunbridge Wells blog, which was launched in 2005, has spent years questioning whether Waitrose will grace the town with their presence. In 2005 he complained the company was 'making us trek to the next town to buy groceries'. A recent post said: 'We have reason for celebration this week, well if you're a shopper that is. 'No, . calm down, Waitrose hasn't arrived yet, but our main shopping centre . has won the prestigious award of ""Best Shopping Centre in the World"".' A Waitrose spokesman said last week: 'I can assure you we're still keen to bring a Waitrose to Tunbridge Wells, however have nothing further to update at the moment.'","(566, 36)","Residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells are expressing their frustration as Waitrose, a high-end supermarket chain, has chosen not to open a store in their town. Despite the recent opening of several branches across Kent, including a second store in Sevenoaks set to open in the coming months, locals in Royal Tunbridge Wells are feeling snubbed. The absence of a Waitrose in Royal Tunbridge Wells has left residents feeling let down. Many locals were hoping for the popular supermarket chain to open a new store in their town, but it appears their wishes have gone unanswered. Scores of residents took to social media to voice their displeasure at the situation. It is not clear why Waitrose has chosen not to open a branch in the town. However, industry insiders speculate that the relatively small population of Royal Tunbridge Wells, compared to the nearby towns of Sevenoaks and Tonbridge, may be a factor. It is also possible that Waitrose may have taken into account the fact that competitors, such as Sainsbury’s and Tesco, already have a presence in the town. Waitrose is a popular supermarket chain in the UK that is known for its high-quality products and customer service. The absence of a Waitrose store in Royal Tunbridge Wells may inconvenience residents who prefer the chain’s products and services. Some locals have expressed their disappointment and frustration at having to travel to nearby towns to shop at Waitrose. Despite the disappointment, some residents are hopeful that Waitrose may reconsider their decision in the future. The opening of a second store in Sevenoaks may indicate that the chain recognizes the potential for growth in the area. It is also possible that local demand for a Waitrose store in Royal Tunbridge Wells may persuade the company to review their decision. For now, residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells will have to make do with the presence of other supermarket chains in the town. However, the continued absence of a Waitrose store may be a missed opportunity for the company to tap into the affluent market in the town. Waitrose is a popular choice among consumers who are willing to pay a premium for high-quality products, and the town’s high-income demographic could be a lucrative market for the chain. In conclusion, the decision by Waitrose not to open a store in Royal Tunbridge Wells has left residents feeling disappointed and frustrated. However, the opening of a second store in Sevenoaks may provide some hope for those hoping for a Waitrose in their town. Only time will tell whether the popular supermarket chain will reconsider their decision and tap into the potential market in Royal Tunbridge Wells.","(482, 20)","By. Lizzie Parry.

(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by
","(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by 12 months until June 2012, killing off speculation that he could be on his way to Real Madrid. Coach Mourinho has signed an extended deal ending fears he could wave goodbye to Inter Milan. Former Chelsea supremo Mourinho took charge at Italian giants Inter a year ago following the departure of Roberto Mancini and has just guided the club to their fourth straight scudetto. They also won the Italian Super Cup, but were eliminated by defending champions Manchester United in the first knockout round of the Champions League. A statement on the Inter Web site read: ""In response to the wish of the coach to continue the project started together a year ago, a wish welcomed with pleasure by the club as a sign of attachment and winning spirit, FC Internazionale announces the extension of Jose Mourinho's contract until 30 June 2012."" Mourinho had promised the fans more titles would be on the after lifting his first Italian title, but the eal issue refused to go away until Monday's statement. When asked about the chance he could leave Inter, Mourinho had earlier told the club Web site: ""There is still a 0.01% (chance). But for me this is not an important number, it just means that I am closer to Inter than to Real. ""I am satisfied with the relationship with the fans and with my players. I repeat, I am closer to staying at Inter than going elsewhere."" Those comments failed to impress Inter president Massimo Moratti, but the extended contract has settled any differences. Mourinho made his mark at Porto in 2004 when he led the Portuguese team to the Champions League title, beating Monaco 3-0 in the final, before moving to Chelsea. At Stamford Bridge he claimed the Premier League title in each of his first two seasons and the FA Cup the following campaign, but left the club in September 2007. Not all Inter fans have warmed to the Portuguese since his arrival in Milan last summer. He has been involved in several disagreements with the Italian media and his style of play has has not endeared him to parts of the Nerazzurri faithful.","(414, 15)","It's official: Jose Mourinho will remain at the helm of Inter Milan for another couple of years. The Portuguese coach has put pen to paper on a new contract that keeps him at the Italian club until at least 30 June 2012. The decision to extend Mourinho's stay puts an end to months of speculation that he could be lured away to Spanish giants Real Madrid. With the 2008-2009 season culminating in a Serie A, Coppa Italia and Champions League triumph for the Italian club, Mourinho was already being recognized as one of the best coaches in the world. But as rumours swirled about his potential exit to Real Madrid, many Inter fans feared that this glorious chapter in the club's history might come to a premature end. Fortunately for the Nerazzurri faithful, Mourinho has apparently found everything he needs at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. ""I'm happy to confirm that I've signed an extension to my contract with Inter,"" he said in a statement. ""I have a great relationship with both the club and the fans, and I'm excited about the challenges that lie ahead."" Under Mourinho's leadership, Inter Milan have become a force to be reckoned with in Italian and European football. The Special One, as he likes to call himself, has raised the bar for Inter's domestic rivals, and has instilled a winning mentality in his players that was previously lacking. The result has been a remarkable run of success which could yet extend further, with Inter looking to defend their titles in Serie A, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League. The news that Mourinho will not be leaving for Real Madrid will come as a tremendous relief for Inter supporters. For many, the prospect of losing a coach of Mourinho's stature and pedigree was simply unthinkable. Now, with the Portuguese mastermind committed to staying in Milan, the club can look forward to a bright future and more success under his guidance. It remains to be seen, however, whether Mourinho's decision to stay with Inter will put an end to the speculation about his future. The rumour mill never sleeps, and other elite clubs may well be looking enviously at what the Portuguese coach has achieved in Italy. For now though, Inter Milan can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that their Special One will be with them for the foreseeable future.","(447, 17)","(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by

A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning . A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning. Blanc Brasserie in London's Covent Garden has been forbidden from offering pink lamb's liver after ignoring a warning from Westminster Council environmental health officers. The food presented an 'imminent risk of injury to health' because of the way it was cooked, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told today. French-born Mr Blanc, 62, is a director of the company that owns the restaurant. James Armitage, Westminster City Council's food, health and safety manager, said: 'After receiving two separate complaints of food poisoning which may have originated from eating at a Covent Garden restaurant, our officers investigated and issued a notice which prevented the restaurant from serving undercooked lambs' liver. 'Today's court decision to uphold the notice is welcome as the serving of undercooked meat, without suitable controls in place, is a public health risk. 'Health inspectors have agreed with the restaurant the safety measures that need to be in place for the restaurant to be allowed to safely put the dish back on its menu.' The two diners contracted campylobacter food poisoning after they had the dish on separate occasions this summer. Guidance from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) recommends that lamb's liver must be cooked at 70 degrees centigrade for at least two minutes. But the Brasserie Bar Co. said it had taken liver off the menu at all 18 of its Blanc Brasserie restaurants throughout Britain after it was ordered to pay £3,103 in costs. A spokeswoman said: 'Brasserie Bar Co. has not contested the environmental health officers' enforcement and will no longer serve liver in any of its restaurants. 'In order to serve liver and comply with Westminster Council, it would need to be overcooked to such an extent that our customers just won't eat it.' Mr Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons restaurant in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, was awarded two Michelin stars in 1985. There were more than 371,000 estimated cases of campylobacter food poisoning in England and Wales in 2009, resulting in more than 17,500 hospitalisations and 88 deaths, according to the FSA.

The restaurant, which is owned and directed by French-born chef Raymond Blanc, 62, was recently visited by environmental health officers after two diners complained of severe food poisoning. The diners had fallen ill with campylobacter, a type of bacteria commonly found in undercooked chicken or other poultry. Despite the warning from the health officers, Blanc Brasserie failed to take any immediate action to rectify their food safety procedures. Instead, the restaurant's management chose to carry on business as usual, putting the health and safety of their customers at risk. The situation at Blanc Brasserie has raised concerns among food safety experts, who warn that ignoring warnings from environmental health officers can have serious consequences. According to experts, failing to take prompt action can lead to the spread of foodborne illness among customers, potentially causing long-lasting health problems and possible legal action. The situation at Blanc Brasserie is particularly concerning given the restaurant's high-end reputation and status as a popular destination for foodies in London. Many of the restaurant's customers are passionate about their food and expect a top-quality dining experience, which includes food safety and hygiene standards that are beyond reproach. Raymond Blanc is a well-known figure in the culinary world, having appeared on numerous TV shows and written several cookbooks. He is also a staunch advocate for sustainable and ethical food practices. The fact that his restaurant seemingly ignored warnings from environmental health officers has raised eyebrows among his fans and supporters. Although the restaurant has not yet issued a statement about the situation, it is likely that the management will face significant backlash from customers and food safety advocates alike. It remains to be seen what steps they will take to rectify the issues raised by the environmental health officers. This incident serves as a reminder to all restaurants and food establishments about the importance of prioritizing food safety and hygiene. Ignoring warnings from experts can have serious health and legal repercussions, which can ultimately harm not only customers but businesses themselves. It is crucial that all food establishments take proactive measures to ensure that their products are safe and healthy for consumption.","(417, 17)","By. Leon Watson.

Two diners fell ill after eating at a top London restaurant run by celebrity chef Marco Pierre White, it has emerged.
Blanc Brasserie, which is owned by the French-born chef, 62, was visited by environmental health officers after two diners complained they had been struck down with campylobacter – a type of food poisoning caused by bacteria found in raw meat, poultry, eggs and unpasteurised milk.
A spokesman for Westminster City Council said: ‘We received a complaint from a member of the public that they had suffered from food poisoning after eating at the restaurant.
‘Environmental health officers visited the premises and issued a hygiene improvement notice.’
The notice, which was issued on October 31, requires the restaurant to take action to improve its hygiene standards within 28 days.

Tesco has won the title of the season's best Easter egg for the second year running - but its luxury offering will set consumers back £25. The Tesco Finest Medley of Flavoured Chocolate Easter Eggs scored 88 out of 100 in the annual Good Housekeeping magazine Easter Egg of the Year award. Judges said they were 'wowed' by the 'beautifully presented' mix of white, milk and dark chocolate, and pieces of butterscotch, raspberry, hazelnut and coconut. We have a winner! The Tesco Finest Medley of Flavoured Chocolate Easter Eggs (R) was crowned Easter Egg of the Year in Good Housekeeping magazine's annual competition . The 1kg (2.2lb) egg was also awarded the title of best for sharing. Last year Tesco won with its own-label Chokablok American Dreamcake egg costing just £5. The Waitrose Woodland Friends Hop The Frog won this year's children's category, scoring 81 out of 100, with judges describing the £5 hollow milk chocolate egg as 'delicious' and also awarding it the 'cuteness' award. The Harrods Belgian Chocolate Lattice Egg, costing £29.95, won the best for grown-ups category, scoring 79 out of 100 for its 'beautifully simple yet elegant eye-catching design with creamy milk chocolate swirls'.

The frog-shaped milk chocolate egg came with a selection of colourful sugar-coated chocolate beans, providing the perfect combo of crunch and sweetness. The design was praised for its cute and fun appearance, making it a perfect treat for little ones this Easter. Taking the crown in the teen category was the Lindt Hello Cookies and Cream egg.

The combination of its aesthetic appeal and rich chocolate taste impressed the judges, making it a clear standout in the competition. However, the overall winner of the best egg category was the Tesco Finest Medley of Flavoured Chocolate Easter Eggs. The box contained six eggs of different flavoured chocolates, including salted caramel, raspberry ripple, and dark chocolate, among others. The variety of flavours and the high-quality chocolate used in each egg made it an exceptional entry. It was no surprise that Tesco was also the winner of last year’s competition, showing their consistency in producing high-quality Easter eggs. The judges praised all the entries in the competition, both for their creative designs and delicious taste. They emphasized the importance of not only using high-quality ingredients but also presenting an innovative design that stood out in a saturated market. As Easter is one of the most significant events in the chocolate industry, it is essential for brands to have products that are unique and memorable for consumers.

A 9-year-old boy has his feet severed while attempting to climb onto a passing train in St. Paul, Minnesota. Around 5:30pm Thursday evening, neighbors witnessed Marshawn Farr-Robinson trying to climb the ladder of a slow moving train. He slipped and the train rolled over his feet.

Railroad accident: Marshawn Farr-Robinson was attempting to climb onto a slow-moving train when he tripped and his feet were cut off . He asked his dad, Dave Thornton, to go check on him and the man found the boy crawling out of the weeds near the tracks with both feet missing. Mr Thornton grabbed the severed feet and wrapped them in a t-shirt hoping doctors might be able to reattach them. He was surprised by how calm the boy was. He seemed more concerned about someone finding and telling his mother more than anything else. Mr Thornton's 15-year-old daughter stayed with the boy while her Dad got help. 'I kept asking him what his name was, what his birthday was. He answered everything. I was amazed at how alert he was. It's a miracle,' Jane Thornton told KSTP. Neighbors to the rescue: 13-year-old Thomas Thornton, left, was the first to notice Marshawn. His sister Jane, right, comforted the boy while her father ran to get help . When emergency responders arrived, they immediately applied tourniquets to both of Marshawn's legs. Marshawn was taken to Gillette Children's Hospital where he is currently recovering. Marshawn's condition is unclear, as his family have asked for privacy. People - children, especially - cross the tracks all the time according to long-time resident Barb Evertz. She told the Star Tribune it's an 'ongoing thing' and that trains blow their horns louder when somebody is on the tracks. She proposes fencing the tracks off. Solution?

","Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to play in the Champions League next season. The rules now effectively set up a scenario where rivals can claim City have cheated their way to passing UEFA’s ‘Financial Fair Play’ (FFP) test. It is understood lawyers for a host of ‘major clubs’ are aware of these potential rights to make appeals — thanks to recently amended Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations — and are monitoring the situation closely. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho question the fairness of FFP . Expensive squad: But could Manchester City's big-spending ways cost them a Champions League place? On Saturday night Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who faces City on Monday in the game of the season so far, accused some unnamed clubs of ‘dodgy FFP’. He said: ‘There are clubs that are following exactly the project of Financial Fair Play and there are other clubs doing it in a dodgy way. For me, that is very clear. I don’t say the clubs — that is not my job.’ When asked specifically about City, and a potential UEFA investigation, he added: ‘It’s for Mr Platini and other people to analyse it, it’s not for me… I’m waiting for that.’ Financial force: Manchester City's spending power is among the greatest in football . 'Dodgy FFP'? Jose Mourinho was critical, but he manages another expensive squad at Chelsea . Concern? Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has a proven track record in the Champions League . FFP rules compel clubs to limit losses for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons combined to £37million, with a ban from European competitions the severest theoretical punishment. City last week announced losses for 2012-13 of £51.6m, meaning they have lost £149.5m over two years. They can perhaps ‘exempt’ as much as £110m of those losses to meet FFP requirements. But they face accusations their losses are artificially low after earning cash from ‘intellectual property’ sales to related companies. UEFA sources have confirmed this will be investigated to see if it is ‘real’ income. Amended small print in the 2014 UEFA FFP rulebook, just published, includes two key changes; one allowing clubs to ‘plea bargain’ punishments for overspending, and another that allows other clubs to challenge those plea bargains if they feel the outcomes negatively affect them. Time to celebrate? Liverpool are one of the clubs not in a position to compete with City's financial muscle . Title rivals: Arsenal could be another team to benefit if City are to face a form of punishment . Money well spent: The signings of players like Sergio Aguero have turned City into a real force .","(520, 23)","The eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League has been thrown into doubt due to a small print in the Financial Fair Play (FFP) rule of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). This has caused concern among the club's supporters, who are worried about the possibility of their beloved team being disqualified from the coveted tournament. The FFP was established to promote financial stability and fair competition among football clubs in Europe. It requires clubs to balance their books and avoid huge debts as a result of excessive spending on players and other expenses. The rule has been hailed as a success by UEFA, but in recent times, some clubs have been accused of flouting the regulation. One such club is Manchester City, which has been embroiled in a long-standing controversy over its financial dealings. The club was fined €30 million and banned from participating in the Champions League for two years by UEFA after it was found guilty of breaching the FFP rule. However, the club appealed the decision and managed to overturn the ban after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Now, the eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League has been thrown into doubt once again due to a small print in the FFP rule. According to reports, the rule states that if any club is found to have breached the FFP rule, it will not only face penalties but also lose its right to appeal against any decision made by UEFA's Adjudicatory Chamber. This has caused concern among the club's supporters, who fear that Manchester City could fall afoul of the rule and lose its right to appeal. The club's manager, Pep Guardiola, has sought to allay fears, saying that he is confident that the club is complying with the FFP rule. However, not everyone is convinced. Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has accused unnamed clubs of engaging in ""dodgy FFP."" He claims that ""major clubs"" are being denied the right to appeal against those clubs that cheat their way to passing the FFP test. The controversy over the FFP rule and Manchester City's eligibility for the Champions League has sparked a wider debate about the regulation itself. Some critics argue that the rule is too restrictive and unfair to clubs that are trying to compete with wealthier rivals. They say that it places an unnecessary burden on clubs and discourages investment in the sport. Others, however, believe that the FFP rule is necessary to promote financial stability and ensure that clubs are not consumed by debt. They argue that without the rule, football could become dominated by a handful of wealthy clubs with limitless resources, which would be detrimental to the sport as a whole. For now, the eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League remains in doubt. The club's supporters will be anxiously watching to see how the situation develops in the coming months, hoping that their team will not be denied the opportunity to compete for one of the biggest prizes in European football.","(573, 22)","Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to

way to passing the FFP test.

means they cannot spend more than they earn.

Weisz, who is known for her roles in major blockbusters such as The Mummy and The Constant Gardener, revealed that it has not always been easy for her to find a balance between her professional life and her responsibilities as a parent. The star admitted that there were moments when she had to make tough decisions and even turn down work opportunities because she wanted to ensure that she was there for her children. ""I don't think I've juggled anything. It's about the choices you make,"" Weisz said. ""I've made some films and turned down some films. It's about the decisions you make in your life, which is a balance."" Weisz's daughter, Gaia, was born in 2006, and so far, the actor has managed to keep her family out of the spotlight, a feat that is not often achieved by other high-profile celebrities. The actor, however, revealed that she has intentionally kept her family out of the media, citing the need for privacy and space. The actor further admitted that the entertainment industry can be unforgiving to working parents, especially mothers, who might be seen as less dedicated to their careers. Weisz confessed that she had to take a break from acting to dedicate her time to parenting before returning to the industry with renewed energy. Despite the challenges, Weisz appears to have found a balance between her professional and personal life, while also raising her children to be successful in their chosen paths. Her adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba is a Harvard graduate and a human rights activist, while her daughter Gaia is pursuing her interests in art and design. In conclusion, Rachel Weisz's story is a testament to the challenges that working mothers face, particularly when in the public eye, and how just like any parent, they must make difficult choices, but with the right balance, they can achieve success both in their professional and personal lives.","(425, 15)","Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time

","Dani Vallverdu is to coach Tomas Berdych following his departure from Andy Murray's team. The Venezuelan became friends with Murray during their time together at the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona and had worked with the Scot for the past five years. Murray announced last month that Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green had left the team, describing the split as 'mutual' in a short statement. Dani Vallverdu (right) works with Andy Murray on the practice court at this year's French Open in Paris . Vallverdu's role in Murray's team increased under Ivan Lendl but the 28-year-old found himself taking a step back when Amelie Mauresmo succeeded Lendl as coach in the summer. Vallverdu has wasted no time finding a new job, and landing a lead coaching position with world No 7 Berdych shows the high regard in which he is held. In a statement on his Facebook page, Berdych said: 'Dear fans and friends ...my new coach for next year will be Danny Vallverdu and Azuz Simcich...thank you to Tomas Krupa and David Vydra for great time and fantastic work.' World No 7 Tomas Berdych in action for the Singapore Slammers at the International Premier Tennis League . Berdych began working with fellow Czech Krupa in 2009 but had been searching for a new influence after seeing most of his rivals appoint big-name coaches. Lendl was his number one choice but the eight-time grand slam champion has so far resisted attempts to lure him back into coaching on the tour. It seems very likely, however, that Lendl's appreciation for Vallverdu's talents will have played a part in Berdych's decision. Murray, who is currently at his pre-season training camp in Miami, intends to appoint a replacement for Vallverdu to work alongside Mauresmo . Vallverdu (right) sits in the stands alongside Murray's former coach Ivan Lendl at the 2012 US Open .","(344, 13)","After five years of coaching Andy Murray, Venezuelan tennis coach Dani Vallverdu has officially parted ways with the British No.1. Vallverdu joined Murray's coaching team back in 2010 and played an instrumental role in the Scot's career - particularly during his two Grand Slam wins at the US Open (2012) and Wimbledon (2013). While it may be a difficult farewell for the two, Vallverdu has now ventured onward to new opportunities. It has been announced that he will now coach Czech world No. 7 Tomas Berdych. It was Berdych's previous coach, Tomas Krupa, who dropped the surprising news on Twitter last week. Vallverdu will take over as Berdych's head coach and will start working with him in January. This is a huge coup for Berdych; Vallverdu's experience in coaching high-calibre players speaks for itself. Before working with Murray he was part of Grigor Dimitrov's team and the Bulgarian player saw his ranking go from world No. 60 to No. 8. It's clear that Vallverdu has the ability to develop players and help them elevate their game to the next level. Berdych must be feeling confident about the appointment. A consistent top 10 player for many years now, he's enjoyed some incredible wins such as making the Wimbledon final back in 2010 and reaching the semi-finals of the Australian Open and French Open. But Vallverdu's track record may just be what he needs to get over those final hurdles and possibly even win his first Grand Slam title. As for Murray, there's no official news on who will replace Vallverdu in his coaching team. The British No. 1 has had a tough time of late, failing to reach his previous heights in the ranking and it's no secret that he needs to make some changes in the near future. Whether that change will come in the form of a new coach remains to be seen.","(356, 19)","Dani Vallverdu is to coach Tomas Berdych following his departure from Andy Murray's team. The

","By . Joshua Gardner . Tragic: Pregnant mother of four Sarah Harkins of Fredericksburg, Virgina died Monday following an allergic reaction to bee stings . A pregnant Virginia mother is dead and her husband left to care for their four children after bee stings brought about her untimely end. Sarah Harkins, 32, lost consciousness Monday after a wasp nest was disturbed in her yard. Paramedics were soon able to revive her, but the tragedy continued when an aneurysm lingering in her brain dislodged during the trauma. Harkins' husbamd Eric must now raise their four children, one of whom was born with Down Syndrome, on his own. 'I’m . thankful to the medic for giving me and the kids that chance, bringing . her back enough so we could say goodbye to her,' Eric told the Free . Lance-Star. The two met while on a mission trip when both attended a Catholic university in Ohio and married in 2005. Their fifth child, a girl they'd named Cecilia Rachel, would have been born this winter. Sarah was 21 weeks pregnant. 'Her . passing was so tough, because I love her so much. She’s a gift that was . given from God, he knows that I needed her, and she was this amazing . gift,' the grief stricken husband and father said. Their . youngest child Faustina, 1, was born with Down Syndrome. Relatives say . they worry that the parenting will be too much for Eric. 'With . Sarah gone, Eric is not equipped to do this by himself,' Sarah's . brother Tom Schulzetenberg told NBC Washington. 'It's something that you . never really prepare for. We're doing our best to hold each other up.' Scroll down for video . Moments of hope: Sarah was 21 weeks pregnant and actually was able to be revived by paramedics . One . way Eric's family, as well as one coworker, have helped is by raising . funds for the children to one day get a 'faith-based education' among . other pricey future needs. 'Sarah’s . absence leaves a massive gap in the lives of these children,' a reads a . message on their YouCaring.com fundraiser. 'Sarah’s husband Eric will . need assistance in fulfilling his wife’s wishes for the children to have . a faith-based education, continue on a wholesome and natural diet, and . support a special needs child.' As . of Thursday, the YouCaring page had raised nearly $40,000. Another . fundraiser on GoFundMe had done even better, having raised an . astonishing $100,000 in just two days. According to her obituary, Sarah is survived by her husband, Eric, their four children: Liam, 7, Analee, 5, Jude, 3, and Faustina, 1, her mother and father and six siblings. Hopes dashed: Though she was initially revived following her allergic reaction to the stings, she soon died when the trauma dislodged a lingering aneurysm in her brain .","(572, 49)","Tragedy struck a family in Fredericksburg as Sarah Harkins, 32, and her unborn child died on Monday. Reports indicate that Harkins was stung by a nest of bees, which led to her untimely death. The incident occurred when Harkins was out in her garden, and the bees were disturbed. The sting was powerful enough to revive her after paramedics arrived, but it also caused a lingering aneurysm in her brain to dislodge, leading to her death. Harkins' sudden demise has left her husband, Eric, and their four children devastated. The youngest child was born with Down Syndrome, making the death of their mother even more challenging for the family to cope with. Friends and family remember Harkins as a devoted mother who loved spending time with her children, especially in their garden. Besides being a hands-on mother, she was also a member of the local school board and was highly involved in the community. As news of Harkins' death spread, many in the Fredericksburg community expressed shock and sadness. One local resident, Grace Simmons, said, ""I can't believe this happened to Sarah. She was such a beautiful person inside and out, and her family meant everything to her. It's just terrible."" Simmons also pointed out that Harkins' death illustrates how even the most ordinary of activities can lead to tragic consequences. The Fredericksburg community has rallied around the Harkin family, organizing fundraisers to help support them in this difficult time. A GoFundMe page was also set up to raise money for funeral expenses and to provide support to the family in the long term. The outpouring of support from the community has provided some comfort to Eric Harkins and his children, as they come to terms with this unimaginable loss. The local police department has urged residents to stay vigilant when dealing with bees or wasps. They emphasized the importance of contacting professionals to take care of nests and to avoid disturbing them. Often, individuals mistakenly think they can handle a bee or wasp problem without professional help, which can lead to serious consequences, as seen in the Harkins case. The tragic passing of Sarah Harkins is a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment with loved ones. The outpouring of support from the Fredericksburg community shows how even in the darkest of times, people can come together and support each other. Our condolences go out to the Harkins family, and we hope they find peace and comfort in the memories of Sarah's life.","(474, 22)","By. Joshua Gardner.

Congratulations! Your article meets the requirements for length and sentence count.
However, there are a few areas where you can improve your writing to make it more engaging
and effective.
Firstly, consider using more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture for your readers.
For example, instead of simply stating that Sarah Harkins “died tragically,” you could say
that she “passed away peacefully in her sleep” or “succumbed to her injuries after a heroic
effort by paramedics to save her life.”
Secondly, try to vary your sentence structure to keep your writing from becoming monotonous.
Instead of using only simple sentences, mix in some compound and complex sentences to add
variety and depth to your writing.
Finally, remember to proofread your work carefully before submitting it. Typos and grammatical
errors can detract from the quality of your writing and make it harder for your readers to
understand your message.
With these tips in mind, I’m confident that you can continue to improve your writing skills
and produce high-quality articles that engage and inform your readers. Keep up the good work!","(339, 17)","By . Joshua Gardner . Tragic: Pregnant mother of four Sarah Harkins of Fredericksburg, Virgina
Sarah Harkins, a 32-year-old mother of four, died Monday after being stung by a nest of honeybees.
Harkins, who was pregnant with her fifth child at the time of the incident, was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead.
According to her husband, Eric Harkins, the incident occurred when a beehive in their backyard was disturbed and the bees stung Harkins in the head.
“It was a freak accident,” Harkins said. “The bees had built a nest in a tree in our backyard, and we had no idea they were there.”
“Sarah was a wonderful mother and wife,” Harkins added. “She was the best person I’ve ever known, and I’m going to miss her so much.”

(CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday.
","(CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday. But even though it took him eight hours, he had every reason to beam. By completing the 26.2 mile course, Singh -- nicknamed the Turbaned Tornado -- became the oldest undisputed runner to finish a marathon. He is 100. Singh, born in rural India in 1911, did not start running marathons until he was 89, after he moved to England following the death of his wife and son. He's completed eight now. ""He says no one is forcing him to do it. It's his desire to do it,"" coach and translator Harmander Singh said Sunday in an interview with CNN affiliate CBC. ""He wanted to do one when he's 100 and today's the day."" Singh was a colorful sight as he started the race in his canary yellow turban and a matching T-shirt with the words "" Sikhs in the City"" printed across its front -- a nod to his faith. He finished more than six hours behind winner Kenneth Mungara of Kenya, who won the event for the fourth straight year. Then again, Mungara is only 38. Singh, the centenarian, already held the World Record for the 90-plus age group, completing the same race in 2003 at age 92. But until now, the title of ""oldest"" was the cause of some debate. The Association of Road Racing Statistician already recognized Singh as the oldest for a marathon he ran at age 93. But the Guinness Book of World Records listed someone else -- Dimitrion Yordanidis, 98, who ran in Athens in 1976. Singh says his secret is a life without alcohol and smoking, a vegetarian diet of curries and tea, and daily exercise. He walks or runs up to 10 miles a day. ""I have said it before: that I will carry on running, as it is keeping me alive,"" Singh told the marathon website.","(374, 19)","At 105 years old, Fauja Singh has become the oldest person to successfully complete a full marathon. The veteran runner achieved this feat by finishing the Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday, his eighth marathon at the age of 89. Born in rural India in 1911, Singh took up running later in life after suffering the loss of his wife and son. Since then, he has become known for his athleticism and perseverance.  Singh’s latest marathon took him six hours and nine minutes to complete, finishing in the 11,000th place overall. When asked how he felt about breaking his own record as the oldest marathoner, Singh replied, “I’m very happy, very happy.” His accomplishment has inspired many, especially those who are often told they are too old to try new things. Singh believes that age is just a number and that people can achieve anything if they have the determination to try.  Despite his age, Singh lives an active lifestyle, taking daily walks in London, where he resides. He also maintains a healthy diet consisting of oats, tea, and ginger curry. Singh is an inspiration to many, showing that it’s never too late to start a new hobby or pursue a passion.  Singh’s journey to becoming a marathon runner started in 2000 when he moved to London to be with his family. There, he discovered his love for long-distance running and eventually joined a running group. He completed his first marathon in 2003 at the age of 92 and has been chasing records ever since.  Singh’s achievements have earned him numerous accolades throughout his running career, including the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award from the Punjab Sports Journalists Association. He has also been recognized by the Guinness World Records as the oldest marathon runner in the world.  As Singh approaches his 106th birthday later this year, he shows no signs of slowing down. He plans to continue his active lifestyle, encouraging others to pursue their passions, no matter how old they may be. Singh’s message is simple: age should never be a barrier to achieving one’s dreams.","(400, 18)","(CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday.

(CNN) -- French Open champion Francesca Schiavone crashed out of Wimbledon in the first round
","(CNN) -- French Open champion Francesca Schiavone crashed out of Wimbledon in the first round after losing in three sets to unseeded Russian Vera Dushevina. Schiavone of Italy, seeded fifth at the All England Club, went down 6-7 7-5 6-1 to a player who has never been beyond the second round at Wimbledon. It was Schiavone's second straight first round exit since the capture of her first grand slam title at Roland Garros earlier in June. Dushevina, ranked 56, lost the first set but grew in confidence as the match went on, racing into a 5-0 lead in the decider and clinching the victory in two hours, 54 minutes. ""It was a tough match on a different surface with a different feeling,"" Schiavone told reporters. ""But she played very well and I didn't take my chance in the second set."" Who can stop Williams sisters? Elsewhere, Kim Clijsters thrashed unseeded Italian Maria Elena Camerin 6-0 6-3 in her first appearance at Wimbledon since 2006. Clijsters of Belgium, who came out of retirement in 2009, wrapped up the first set in just 24 minutes on Court Two. And although the Italian fought hard in the second, the eighth seed did not face a single break point as she won in 65 minutes. Clijsters will next face Croatia's Karolina Sprem, who beat American qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-3 6-4. Meanwhile, five-time champion Venus Williams cruised into the second round with a 6-3 6-2 win over Paraguay's Rossana De Los Rios. ""It's good to be back. I love playing on the grass,"" Williams said. ""It was pretty straightforward out there but it's just the first round and I'll try to play better with each match."" In other results, Justine Henin of Belgium beat Latvia's Anastasija Sevastova 6-4 6-3, Marion Bartoli of France, the 2007 finalist, beat Julia Goerges 6-4 6-3 and there were wins for Russians Nadia Petrova, Vera Zvonareva and Maria Kirilenko. It was a disappointing day for the home nation with British women Laura Robson, Elena Baltacha and Melanie South all beaten on day one. Robson went down 6-3 7-6 to fourth seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia, Baltacha lost to Croatia's Petra Martic in three sets 2-6 7-5 6-3 and wildcard South was beaten 6-1 6-2 by Regina Kulikova of Russia.","(437, 18)","The first day of Wimbledon saw some surprising results, as well as some expected wins. French Open champion, Francesca Schiavone, suffered a shock defeat against Russian player Vera Dushevina. Schiavone, who won her first Grand Slam title at Roland Garros just a few weeks ago, was expected to do well on the grass courts of Wimbledon, but struggled to find her form and lost 7-6, 6-3 in the first round. Meanwhile, former world number one, Kim Clijsters, made a successful return to Wimbledon, winning her first match since 2006. Clijsters, who has won four Grand Slam titles, only dropped three games in her match against Maria Elena Camerin. The Belgian player looked in excellent form and will be one to watch as the tournament progresses. Five-time Wimbledon champion, Venus Williams, also advanced to the second round after beating Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan in straight sets. Williams, who has struggled with injuries over the past year, seemed to be back to her best and will no doubt be aiming for a sixth Wimbledon title. Former world number one, Justine Henin, also had a successful start to the tournament, beating Kristina Barrois of Germany in straight sets. Henin, who won the French Open in 2010, is looking to add another Grand Slam title to her collection and will be hoping to make a deep run into the tournament. However, it was not all good news for British fans, as all three of their female players lost on the first day of the tournament. Elena Baltacha, Laura Robson, and Melanie South all suffered defeats, crushing the hopes of the home crowd. Baltacha, who had been awarded a wildcard into the tournament, lost to Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic, while Robson was beaten by Jarmila Gajdosova of Australia. South, who is making her comeback from injury, lost to Maria Kirilenko of Russia. Overall, the first day of Wimbledon provided some thrilling matches and a mix of expected and surprising results. Many fans will be eagerly awaiting the second-round matches, hoping to see some more upsets and impressive performances from their favorite players.","(399, 16)","(CNN) -- French Open champion Francesca Schiavone crashed out of Wimbledon in the first round

(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin
","(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin Raphel in October as part of a counterintelligence investigation, three U.S. government officials told CNN. As part of the investigation, Raphel's State Department office was searched and sealed, two of the officials said. It's unclear whether she is the target of the investigation, or what agents were searching for. The officials said it is an ongoing investigation and no charges have been filed. The investigation was first reported by The Washington Post. ""We are aware of this law enforcement matter. The State Department has been cooperating with our law enforcement colleagues,"" State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said. Psaki added that Raphel is ""no longer a department employee."" At the time of the raid, Raphel, a retired career Foreign Service officer, was an adviser on Pakistan under a limited, renewable contract to the State Department's Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, where she administered nonmilitary aid and economic grants. It is unclear, however, whether the inquiry is related to her work on Pakistan. Senior State Department officials said Raphel's security clearance was pulled last month, at which time she was placed on administrative leave. Her contract, which expired on November 2, was not renewed. The officials describe the investigation as a counterintelligence investigation, which typically refers to allegations of spying on behalf of foreign governments. Officials declined to describe the exact nature of the investigation. Raphel, the former assistant secretary of state for South Asia and ambassador to Tunisia, spent much of her career working on Pakistan and South Asia. Raphel was well-liked and respected by her colleagues and often outspoken about what she saw as flaws with U.S. policy toward Pakistan. Raphel's State Department biography says she began her career as a CIA analyst before serving 30 years in the Foreign Service. She retired from the State Department in 2005, but returned in 2009 to work as an adviser to the late Richard Holbrooke, appointed by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the first special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. CNN attempted to contact Raphel, but messages have not been returned.","(407, 19)","Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin Raphel, who was working for the State Department, is under scrutiny after her office and home were searched on suspicion of sharing sensitive information with Pakistan. According to officials, her security clearance has been pulled and her contract has not been renewed. Raphel, 67, has had a long and successful career in government service, serving over three decades in several government agencies. She was appointed as the State Department's first Coordinator for Counterterrorism in 1994 and she has since worked as U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia, Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs and as a senior advisor to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Pakistan has long been accused of providing safe havens to terrorist groups and the U.S. has been dependent on Pakistan for its war in Afghanistan. Raphel's expertise in U.S.-Pakistan relations made her an important player in shaping U.S. policy towards the country. However, the search in her office and home has raised alarm bells, as officials suspect that she may have shared classified information with Pakistan. The search was conducted by the FBI and the Diplomatic Security Service, which investigates allegations of misconduct by State Department employees. Raphel has not been charged with any crime, and it is unclear what evidence the investigators may have found. In a statement, the State Department said they were cooperating with the investigation and that they take allegations of misconduct seriously. Raphel has been a controversial figure in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship, with some accusing her of being too sympathetic to Pakistan's interests. In the past, she has advocated for closer ties between the two countries and has praised Pakistan's efforts to combat terrorism. Her removal from her position at the State Department could signal a shift in U.S. policy towards Pakistan, as the Trump administration has taken a more hostile stance towards the country. In August, the U.S. announced that it would withhold $300 million in military aid to Pakistan over its failure to take action against terrorist groups. The investigation into Raphel's activities could also have wider implications for the State Department, which has been under scrutiny for its handling of classified information. The controversy surrounding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure has raised questions about the department's security protocols. For now, the investigation into Raphel's activities continues, and her future in government service remains uncertain.","(446, 18)","(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin

Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball
","Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball bat . A pregnant woman who was beaten to death by her boyfriend who assaulted with a baseball bat has died, but not before giving birth to a baby girl. Police say 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco, who was originally from Mexico, was pronounced dead on Wednesday morning after being violently assaulted at her trailer park home in Delaware. Miss Polanco was found by paramedics and died just hours later from her injuries. Before she died, she gave birth to a baby girl who was born three months premature. The newborn is listed in critical but stable condition at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. Police were called to the home in the Waterford Trailer Park after paramedics found the woman unconscious inside the home. Investigators claim Paula's injuries were caused  by 24-year-old Fernando Flores who assaulted her. Flores was arrested that same day and charged with assault, although the charges have now been elevated to that of manslaughter. He is now in the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution awaiting trial. Miss Polanco (left) was found by paramedics and died just hours later from her injuries. Fernando Flores (right) was arrested that same day and charged with assault, although the charges have now been elevated to that of manslaughter . Paola's family in Puente de Camotlan in Mexico are hoping that people may be able to donate to help bring her body back to her home country. They have set up a page which they also hope will help to raise some funds to help care for her  newborn baby girl which the family will now look after. So far the page has raised $1,095. The fundraising page reads: 'Paola Eden Delagado Polanco was a young thriving girl and full of life, with charming simplicity and humility. 'She died October 29 at her 21 years as a victim of domestic violence. Paola was six months pregnant, and by a miracle the baby survived. God has plans for all of us and Paola is now in the kingdom of heaven with our Heavenly Father. She was beautiful, but her inner beauty was far more radiant than her physical attractiveness. 'We urge support for funeral expenses and to send her body to rest in her home town of Puente de Camotlan Nayarit, Mexico. We also ask for your help in the expenses for her premature baby girl who has a long journey ahead of her. Thank you and may God bless you.'","(464, 23)","Tragedy struck a family in Newark, New Jersey when Paola Delgado-Polanco, a 32-year-old woman originally from Mexico, was pronounced dead on Wednesday morning. Delgado-Polanco had been pregnant and was rushed to the hospital after experiencing complications with her pregnancy. Her baby, who was born three months premature, is in a critical but stable condition. According to authorities, Delgado-Polanco was brought to University Hospital on Tuesday evening. It was reported that she was struggling to breathe and doctors quickly discovered that her baby was in distress. Despite their best efforts, Delgado-Polanco passed away early the next morning. The family is understandably devastated by the loss of Delgado-Polanco. She was a beloved wife and mother-to-be, and her death has left a void in their lives. However, they are grateful that her baby is still fighting and receiving the care that they need at the hospital. Delgado-Polanco's story is a painful reminder of the dangers that women can face during pregnancy. In the United States, maternal mortality rates are rising, and women of color are disproportionately affected. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, black and American Indian/Alaska Native women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women. It is not clear at this time what caused Delgado-Polanco's death, and an autopsy will likely be performed to determine the cause. However, her family hopes that their loss can bring attention to the issue of maternal mortality and encourage efforts to improve maternal healthcare in the United States. The family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the medical expenses for Delgado-Polanco's baby. They are asking for donations to help support the baby's care and provide for their future. As of Thursday, the page has raised over $20,000. The community has rallied around the family in their time of need. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka expressed his condolences on Twitter, writing ""Our prayers are with the family of Paola Delgado-Polanco during this difficult time. We stand with them, work to support them, and will do all we can to ease their pain."" The Delgado-Polanco family has been touched by the outpouring of support from the community. They ask that people keep them in their thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. In conclusion, the loss of Paola Delgado-Polanco is a heartbreaking reminder of the dangers that women can face during pregnancy. Her family is mourning her loss while also praying for the recovery of her premature baby. The community is rallying around them and supporting their needs during this difficult time. We can only hope that this tragedy raises awareness about the need for improved maternal healthcare in the United States.","(497, 26)","Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball

Domestic violence is a serious issue that affects people from all walks of life, regardless of age, gender, or socioeconomic status.
It can take many forms, including physical, emotional, sexual, and financial abuse.
Victims of domestic violence often suffer in silence, fearing for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.
However, it is important to remember that help is available, and there are resources and organizations that can provide support and assistance to those in need.
If you suspect that someone you know is a victim of domestic violence, reach out to them and offer your support.
Encourage them to seek help from a trusted friend, family member, or professional.

This tragic incident serves as a reminder of the dangers of domestic violence and the importance of seeking help if you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship.
Domestic violence is a serious issue that affects people from all walks of life, regardless of age, gender, or socioeconomic status.
It can take many forms, including physical, emotional, sexual, and financial abuse.
Victims of domestic violence often suffer in silence, fearing for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.
However, it is important to remember that help is available, and there are resources and organizations that can provide support and assistance to those in need.
If you suspect that someone you know is a victim of domestic violence, reach out to them and offer your support.
Encourage them to seek help from a trusted friend, family member, or professional.
Remember, you can make a difference by speaking up and standing up for those who cannot speak for themselves.","Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball

Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and
","Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and a government official said Tuesday. There were conflicting reports about where Mehsud died. The government official told CNN Mehsud died as a result of the January 14 attack in North Waziristan. He was seriously injured, and was moved to the Orakzai region, where he died and was buried more than a week ago, the official said, citing information from local pro-government militias. Other sources said Mehsud died near the city of Multan in central Pakistan while on his way to a treatment center in Karachi. Authorities have been looking into reports that Mehsud died after being wounded last month in a drone attack. Word of his death contradicts a statement by a Taliban spokesman last week that Mehsud was alive and in hiding. Also last week, a Pakistani news outlet reported that Mehsud had been killed. State broadcaster PTV reported that Mehsud was wounded in a drone attack this month, died and was buried. The drone attack occurred at a madrassa, or religious school, said Pakistani intelligence and local officials in North Waziristan. The school had been converted into a training camp for militants, the officials said. That attack came a few days after Mehsud appeared in a video released by the Pakistani Taliban. In it, he sits next to Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, the man thought to be the suicide bomber who killed seven CIA officers and consultants and a Jordanian army captain at a base in eastern Afghanistan on December 30. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. It was carried out to avenge the death of Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year, according to al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid. Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe, not the same family. The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones, or unmanned aircraft. But the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. Journalist Nasir Dawar contributed to this report .","(402, 19)","Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, has reportedly been killed, according to three Taliban sources. A government source has also confirmed that Mehsud died after an attack that took place on January 14th in North Waziristan. Authorities have been investigating several reports claiming that Mehsud was killed in a drone attack that occurred last month. However, Taliban spokesman Shahidullah Shahid last week said that Mehsud was alive and well. Mehsud has been the leader of the Pakistani Taliban since 2009 and is believed to have been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in the country. He was also involved in the failed Times Square bombing in New York City in 2010. His death marks a significant blow to the Pakistani Taliban, which has been responsible for numerous attacks in the country over the past several years. The group has been fighting for the implementation of strict Islamic law and the overthrow of the Pakistani government. The news of Mehsud's death has been met with mixed reactions in Pakistan. Some have welcomed the news, seeing it as a victory in the fight against terrorism. Others, however, have expressed concern that the death of the Pakistani Taliban leader could lead to further violence and instability in the country. The Pakistani government has not yet issued an official statement on Mehsud's death. Meanwhile, the US government has not yet confirmed or denied its involvement in the attack that killed Mehsud. The US has been carrying out drone strikes in Pakistan for several years, targeting members of the Taliban and other militant groups. The Pakistani government has publicly criticized the US drone program, calling it a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. However, the US maintains that drone strikes are necessary in the fight against terrorism. It remains to be seen what impact Mehsud's death will have on the Pakistani Taliban and the broader fight against terrorism in Pakistan. The country has been dealing with a wave of violence in recent years, and the death of a high-profile militant leader could either exacerbate the situation or lead to a turning point in the fight against terrorism.","(386, 18)","Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and

Mehsud's death would be a major blow to the Pakistani Taliban, which has been waging a bloody insurgency against the Pakistani government since 2007.
The group has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the 2012 attack on a school in Peshawar that killed more than 140 people, most of them children.
If confirmed, Mehsud's death would also be a major victory for the United States, which has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture or death.
The United States has accused Mehsud of being behind a number of attacks on U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, including a 2009 suicide bombing that killed seven CIA employees in Khost, Afghanistan.
U.S. officials have said they believe Mehsud was responsible for the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt, although he has not been charged in connection with that attack.
The Pakistani Taliban is a separate group from the Afghan Taliban, but the two groups have close ties and often coordinate their activities.
The death of Mehsud would likely lead to a power struggle within the Pakistani Taliban, as different factions vie for control of the group.

","By . Andy Sims, Press Association . England shotgun ace Charlotte Kerwood blasted her way to Commonwealth Games glory in the double trap. The 27-year-old from Sussex was in devastating form at the Barry Buddon Centre in Dundee, nailing 94 of her 120 clays to claim her third individual Commonwealth gold medal. Kerwood won her first gold at Manchester 2002 aged just 15, and would probably have more in her collection had the event not been excluded in Delhi last time out. Shooting for gold: Charlotte Kerwood was in brilliant form in the double trap event . Easy peasy: Kerwood won her third Commonwealth Games gold medal in the double trap on Sunday . She finished two shots clear of India's Shreyasi Singh, who claimed silver. Rachel Parish, with whom Kerwood also won pairs gold at Melbourne 2006, made it a medal double for England by taking bronze. The 33-year-old from Nottingham finished level with Canada's Cynthia Meyer on 91 and triumphed in a sudden-death shoot-off. Kerwood led by five shots at the start of the final round and appeared relaxed, smiling and laughing, as the competitors lined up. But with Singh and Meyer closing in, she missed a pair halfway through the round and gave herself a dressing down before holding her nerve over the final few shots. 'It feels pretty good, I can't quite believe it,' Kerwood told Press Association Sport. 'The Commonwealth Games obviously like me, it's a good event to come to. 'I was laughing because I didn't realise I was five targets ahead at the start, so I thought 'no pressure!' Then I felt it was slipping away from me a little bit, which wasn't good. But now it feels amazing.' Congratulations: Kerwood gets a hug after easing to victory in the shooting double trap event . Kerwood will have little opportunity to celebrate, though, as she lines up in her favoured event, the Olympic trap, on Monday morning. 'That will be good experience for tomorrow because now I know what to expect with the crowd and everything. 'There's no time to celebrate yet. Tomorrow is what I have been training for. My coach thinks I was crazy going for this one as well but I'm going to be more confident now.' For Parish, who claimed silver behind Kerwood in the individual event eight years ago, it was also a test of nerve in the shoot-off. 'I've practised doing that before with the other England guys, I knew what was coming and I knew I'd done it before and I could do it again - and I did,' she said. 'I'm disappointed with the way I shot today, I know I can shoot a lot better than that, so I'm really pleased to have come away with a medal. 'I think there will be some champagne now. Possibly a lot!'","(547, 28)","British shooter Charlotte Kerwood added another gold medal to her impressive portfolio on Saturday at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. The 27-year-old nailed 94 of 120 clays to win her third Commonwealth gold, finishing two shots clear of India's Shreyasi Singh. Kerwood first tasted success in Manchester back in 2002, at the young age of just 15, when she won her first Commonwealth gold medal. Since then, she has become a familiar face in international shooting competitions and has continued to impress. ""I'm absolutely delighted,"" exclaimed Kerwood. ""It's always special to win a gold medal, but to do it at a major event like the Commonwealth Games is even sweeter. The competition was tough, but I managed to keep my focus and put in a solid performance."" Kerwood's focus will now turn to her favored event, the Olympic trap, which takes place on Monday. She will be hoping to add to her impressive collection of medals, which includes a silver at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and a bronze at the 2010 Delhi games. Despite her success on the international stage, Kerwood remains humble and dedicated to her craft. ""Shooting is a sport that requires a lot of hard work and training,"" she said. ""I'm constantly striving to improve my technique and consistency. It's a tough sport, but one that I love and am passionate about."" Kerwood's success is a testament to her determination and dedication, and she serves as an inspiration to aspiring shooters around the world. Her impressive collection of medals is a reminder that anything is possible with hard work and perseverance. The Commonwealth Games continue to provide a platform for young athletes to showcase their skills on an international stage. With competition stiffening every year, it is clear that this is where future Olympians are born. As the games draw to a close, it is clear that these athletes have left an indelible mark on the sporting world. They have demonstrated that with hard work, determination, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, anything is possible. We look forward to seeing what these athletes will achieve in the future.","(407, 20)","By. Andy Sims, Press Association. England shotgun ace Charlotte Kerwood blasted her way

(CNN) -- A man was shot and killed Saturday in Oakland, California, during a confrontation
","(CNN) -- A man was shot and killed Saturday in Oakland, California, during a confrontation with Bay Area Rapid Transit officers and Oakland police, police spokesman Jeff Thomason said. The incident occurred after Oakland police received a call about 8:15 a.m. (11:15 a.m. ET) of an armed man walking toward the Fruitvale BART station, according to Thomason. Police notified BART officers, who also responded. BART officers were the first to reach the suspect, described as a Hispanic male between 30 and 40 years old, Thomason said. The BART officers chased the man from the station to the street, where Oakland police joined in the pursuit over four blocks in the Fruitvale area. Thomason said Oakland police tried to Taser the man twice, but to no effect. The man, armed with two knives, then attempted to charge at one of the officers, a police statement said. Multiple officers opened fire, killing him, the statement said. The man has not yet been identified, Thomason said. The shooting is under investigation by the Oakland police homicide unit, internal affairs and the Alameda County district attorney. ""Anytime there is a loss of life, it is a matter of great concern and sadness for us all,"" Oakland Mayor Ronald Dellums said in a statement. ""It is extremely important that we as a community continue to work together in order to provide a safe and secure environment. Therefore, a thorough investigation of the circumstances surrounding this death has begun."" BART police have also opened a separate, parallel investigation. The incident comes more than a week after a former BART police officer was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2009 shooting death of an unarmed black man on a train platform at the Fruitvale station. The January 1, 2009, shooting of 22-year-old Oscar Grant was captured on a bystander's cell-phone video camera. The video was widely circulated on the Internet and on news broadcasts, and it spurred several protests in and around Oakland. The video showed former officer Johannes Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Grant in the back as another officer knelt on the unarmed man. Mehserle and other Bay Area Rapid Transit police had been called to the Fruitvale station after passengers complained about fights on a train. Officers pulled several men, including Grant, off the train when it arrived at Fruitvale.","(444, 21)","In a shocking turn of events, police officers responding to a report of an armed man near the Fruitvale BART station were forced to shoot the suspect after their attempts at subduing him failed. The man, who remains unidentified at this time, brandished a knife and refused to comply with police orders, leading to a deadly confrontation. According to eyewitnesses, the man appeared agitated and erratic when police arrived on the scene. Despite their efforts to deescalate the situation, the man continued to resist, leading to a tense standoff between police and the suspect. In an effort to subdue the man, police officers attempted to use Tasers on him twice, but to no avail. This only seemed to agitate the suspect further, as he turned on the officers with the knife in his hand. At this point, police officers were left with no choice but to use lethal force. They opened fire on the suspect, who was subsequently transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. As is the standard procedure in cases of police-involved shootings, an investigation has been launched to determine whether the officers' use of force was justified. The officers involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave pending the conclusion of the investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage and raised questions about police use of force, especially in cases involving people suffering from mental health issues. Critics argue that the officers in this incident could have done more to deescalate the situation before resorting to lethal force. In response to the shooting, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf released a statement expressing her condolences to the family of the deceased and promising a full investigation into the incident. ""The use of lethal force is always a last resort, and we owe it to the family and the community to understand what led to this tragic outcome,"" Schaaf said in the statement. The incident near the Fruitvale BART station serves as a stark reminder of the dangers that police officers face every day in their efforts to protect our communities. As the investigation into this incident continues, it is clear that there are no simple answers when it comes to issues of police use of force, mental health, and public safety.","(416, 16)","(CNN) -- A man was shot and killed Saturday in Oakland, California, during a confrontation

(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant
","(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant owners A.M.S.P Suppiah and his wife Kanageswary Suppiah. In a David-and-Goliath match-up in the world of fast food, McCurry -- a small Indian curry shop in Malaysia -- has won an eight-year legal battle against the hamburger giant. McDonald's claimed that the prefix ""Mc"" in McCurry trampled on its trademark. The country's Federal Court on Tuesday ruled that it didn't. ""We're very relieved -- much, much relieved -- that this eight-year-old saga is finally over,"" said McCurry owner P. Suppiah. ""We're a typical South Asian-Malay cuisine. No way people walking into McCurry can confuse us with McDonald's."" The sparse 24/7 self-service restaurant in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is popular with blue-collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare, such as biryani rice and fishhead curry. Its logo: a chicken flashing a thumbs-up. The eatery opened in 1999. McDonald's filed suit two years later. ""We were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court,"" Suppiah said. ""We felt that we had nothing in common, because we were not selling any Western fast food."" The hamburger chain, which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia, said McCurry was violating the prefix ""Mc"" and that McDonald's had the right to protect it. McCurry, in turn, said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across Europe. Furthermore, it said, the ""Mc"" in McCurry stands for ""Malaysian Chicken Curry."" A lower court ruled in favor of McDonald's, and Suppiah appealed. An appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling, prompting McDonald's to appeal this time. On Tuesday, the Federal Court -- the highest in the land -- held up the appeals court ruling. McDonald's said it accepts the judgment. ""We respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment,"" said Liam Jeory of McDonald's Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Suppiah said the ruling means he can now add other McCurry locations, with its slogan: ""Tasty and so Gooood.""","(425, 23)","In a surprise victory, the Indian restaurant chain McCurry has come out on top in a legal battle with fast food giant McDonald’s. In a case that has been dubbed a David-and-Goliath match-up, McDonald’s had claimed that the use of “Mc” in the McCurry name infringed on its trademark. However, the judge presiding over the case ultimately ruled in favor of McCurry, stating that there was no evidence of confusion between the two brands. McCurry owner P. Suppiah expressed relief at the decision, stating, “We’re very relieved -- much, much relieved.” The case was brought to court after McDonald’s filed a trademark infringement suit against McCurry. In the suit, McDonald’s argued that the use of “Mc” in the McCurry name and branding could cause confusion and dilute the McDonald’s trademark. The case was closely watched by many in the fast food industry, as it was seen as a test of whether the McDonald’s trademark was strong enough to prevent other companies from using similar names or branding. In his ruling, the judge noted that the two brands were quite distinct from one another, with McDonald’s primarily offering burgers and fries and McCurry specializing in Indian cuisine. The judge also pointed out that the use of “Mc” was not unique to McDonald’s and had been used by other companies in the past. Despite this ruling, McDonald’s has vowed to continue protecting its trademark and has said that it is considering an appeal. In a statement, the company said, “We are disappointed with the court’s decision and are currently considering our options. We remain committed to protecting our brand and trademarks.” McCurry, on the other hand, is celebrating its legal victory and has said that it will continue to operate under its current name and branding. The company’s success in this case could also potentially pave the way for other small businesses to use the “Mc” prefix in their names without fear of legal action from McDonald’s. Overall, the case highlights the challenges faced by smaller companies when taking on large corporations in legal battles, as well as the importance of protecting intellectual property and trademarks in the fast-paced and competitive world of fast food.","(432, 13)","(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant
defeated McDonald's in a legal battle over the use of the word ""Mc"" in its name, a Singapore court ruled Wednesday.
McDonald's had claimed that McCurry's use of the ""Mc"" infringed on its trademark, but the Singapore High Court rejected the fast food giant's argument.
""We're very relieved,"" McCurry owner P.Suppiah told CNN after the ruling. ""Much, much relieved.""
McDonald's said it was disappointed with the ruling and was considering an appeal.
McCurry, which serves Indian food, opened in 1997 in Singapore, where McDonald's has been operating since 1979. The two restaurants are located just a few blocks from each other in the city-state's Orchard Road shopping district.
McDonald's filed a lawsuit against McCurry in 2001, claiming that McCurry's name was too similar to McDonald's and would confuse customers into thinking the two restaurants were related.
McDonald's also argued that McCurry was trying to ride on the coattails of McDonald's success by using the ""Mc"" prefix in its name.
McCurry countered that it had been using the name for more than 10 years before McDonald's filed the lawsuit, and that there was no confusion between the two restaurants because they served different types of food.
The Singapore High Court agreed with McCurry, saying there was no evidence that customers were confused about the difference between the two restaurants.
The court also said that McDonald's had waited too long to file the lawsuit, as McCurry had been using its name for more than a decade before McDonald's took action.
McDonald's said in a statement that it was ""disappointed"" with the ruling, and that it was considering appealing the decision.
""We believe we have a strong case and will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights,"" the company said.
McCurry's Suppiah said he was happy with the ruling, but added that the legal battle had taken a toll on him and his family.
""It's been a very stressful time for us,"" he said. ""We're just glad that it's finally over.""
McCurry's victory is a rare win for a small business against a multinational corporation. In recent years, large companies have been increasingly aggressive in protecting their trademarks, often filing lawsuits against small businesses that they claim are infringing on their intellectual property.
The case is also significant because it could set a precedent for other small businesses in Singapore and around the world that are facing similar challenges from large corporations.
McCurry plans to continue operating under its current name, and Suppiah says he hopes the ruling will send a message to other small businesses that they can stand up to big corporations.

Suppiah said he had no plans to change the name of his restaurant.

The court ruled that McDonald's had failed to prove that the use of the name would cause confusion among customers.
The court also said McDonald's did not have a monopoly on the use of ""Mc.""
""The use of 'Mc' is not exclusive to McDonald's,"" the court said in its ruling. ""It is also used by other fast food restaurants.""

ROME, Italy -- Captain Javier Zanetti saved Inter Milan's unbeaten Serie A record as he
","ROME, Italy -- Captain Javier Zanetti saved Inter Milan's unbeaten Serie A record as he rifled home a stunning late volley to earn a 1-1 draw against second-placed Roma at the San Siro on Wednesday. Zanetti celebrates his late strike as Inter retained their unbeaten Serie A record with a 1-1 draw against Roma. Roma captain Francesco Totti had given the visitors a deserved first-half leadbut Zanetti's strike two minutes from time maintained Inter's nine-point lead at the top. Roma needed to win to breathe new life into the title race but they were dealt a cruel blow as French defender Philippe Mexes was sent-off late on for two bookings in quick succession. Inter capitalised and they have now lost only once in their last 65 league matches. The home side had the first clear-cut chance of the match and were within centimeters of taking the lead when Hernan Crespo met a cross from Patrick Vieira with an acrobatic volley, but saw his effort cannon back off the post. The defending champions were made to pay for that miss on 38 minutes as the visitors orchestrated a sublime goal. Neat footwork from Macedonia international Mirko Vucinic released Max Tonetto down the left and his pin-point cross was flicked home at the near post by Totti from six meters out as he stole in front of defender Cristian Chivu. Inter center-back Nicolas Burdisso should have restored parity in first-half stoppage time but his header from Luis Figo's corner flew over the bar. Figo himself had a great chance on 54 minutes but after having time to set himself up for an attempted volley, he skewed his effort so badly that it did not even go out of play. After Mexes' dismissal 10 from time, Inter laid siege to Roma's goal. Goalkeeper Doni had to be alert to tip over Crespo's header three minutes from time but he could do nothing about Zanetti's volley a minute later. Meanwhile, AC Milan slipped to fifth place as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Catania. Brazilian teenager Pato gave them the lead early in the second half with a skimming long-range shot but substitute Gionathan Spinesi's header earnt the Sicilians a point. Fiorentina are up to fourth after they defeated Livorno 1-0 at home thanks to a goal from Senegal forward Ndiaye Papa Waigo. E-mail to a friend .","(425, 16)","In a thrilling Serie A encounter, Inter Milan managed to salvage a 1-1 draw against Roma thanks to a late goal from their ever-reliable skipper, Javier Zanetti. Despite the draw, the result ensured that Inter Milan maintained their comfortable nine-point lead at the top of the Serie A table and remained unbeaten in the league. The match had started off in a high-octane fashion with both sides creating opportunities, but none were converted in the opening period. Roma took the lead in the 60th minute when Simone Perrotta fired home following a neat one-two with Francesco Totti. Roma held on to their lead for over thirty minutes as Inter Milan peppered the opposition goal with shots. Inter Milan finally found the equalizer in the 92nd minute when their beloved captain Javier Zanetti struck a stunning shot into the bottom corner of the Roma net, sending the Inter faithful into absolute delirium. Zanetti's late contribution was a fitting tribute to the legend on his 600th appearance for the club. The draw was a valuable point for Roma who had been on a poor run of form recently, while Inter Milan maintained their cushion at the top of the table. The result also meant that enemy city rivals AC Milan slipped down to fifth place after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Catania. Milan had taken the lead in the 17th minute through Robinho's header, but Catania equalized just before half-time through a goal from Gonzalo Bergessio. Despite intense pressure from Milan during the second half, they were unable to find a winner, as Catania defended resolutely. The draw left Milan five points behind Inter Milan, who continued to set the pace in the Serie A race. The result also marked Milan's second consecutive draw, following their stalemate against Udinese in the previous game week. With just a handful of games remaining in the season, Inter Milan will look to maintain their lead and remain unbeaten, while AC Milan will need to win their remaining games if they are to bridge the gap to their rivals. One thing is for certain, the Serie A title race is far from over, and there promises to be plenty of twists and turns in the coming weeks.","(407, 15)","ROME, Italy -- Captain Javier Zanetti saved Inter Milan's unbeaten Serie A record as he

(CNN) -- Authorities in Tehran, Iran, have given the go-ahead to execute a woman who
","(CNN) -- Authorities in Tehran, Iran, have given the go-ahead to execute a woman who initially was sentenced to death by stoning, according to an activist working on her behalf. However, what method will be used to execute Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani is unclear, said Mina Ahadi, spokeswoman for the International Committee Against Stoning. The execution could happen as soon as Wednesday, she said, citing information received from a source in Tabriz, Iran, who is close to Ashtiani's family. Ashtiani initially was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. The Iranian government later said she was also convicted of murdering her husband, but her lawyer and family dispute that. A letter from Tehran was delivered to the prison in Tabriz where Ashtiani is being held three days ago, Ahadi said, giving the go-ahead for Ashtiani's execution. Ashtiani, 43 and a mother of two, drew international attention when she was sentenced to death by stoning. She concedes that she was convicted of adultery, as initially reported, but says she was acquitted of murder. ""The man who actually killed my husband was identified and imprisoned, but he is not sentenced to death,"" she said in August. The Iranian government's claims that she was convicted of murder are a lie, she told the Guardian newspaper through an intermediary. ""They are embarrassed by the international attention on my case, and they are desperately trying to distract attention and confuse the media so that they can kill me in secret."" Ashtiani's son and her attorney are still in jail after being arrested last month, Ahadi said. Also still detained are two German journalists. ""The International Committees against Stoning and Execution call on international bodies and the people of the world to come out in full force against the state-sponsored murder of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani,"" as well as the release of the others, Ahadi said in a statement. Before his arrest, Ashtiani's son, Sajjad Ghaderzadeh, said court officials stole documents and files pertaining to the murder of his father in order to ""promote his mother as a murderer."" And Ahadi's committee said the murder charges are ""fabricated"" by the Iranian regime. In August, Ashtiani appeared on state TV confessing that she knew about a plot to kill her husband but felt she had been misled. Amnesty International condemned the interview. Ghaderzadeh and attorney Hootan Kian will not be issued an attorney, because the government claims they do not need one, according to Ahadi. Ashtiani's other former lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, is being protected by European diplomats after he fled to Turkey from Iran. Mostafaei claims that Iranian authorities tried to arrest him without cause.","(508, 21)","Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, a woman who was initially sentenced to death by stoning in Iran, could be executed as soon as Wednesday. The case of Ashtiani has attracted international attention due to the controversy surrounding her sentencing, which has been condemned by human rights organizations around the world. Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006, according to her lawyer, and was sentenced to death by stoning. The sentence was later reduced to a 10-year prison term after international outrage. However, the Iranian government has alleged that she was also convicted of murder, a charge that her family denies. Ashtiani's fate has been the subject of much debate and outcry from various groups, including the Vatican, which has called for her release. In 2010, the Italian government offered to take her in as a refugee, but Iranian authorities declined the offer. Human rights organizations have also called on the Iranian government to release Ashtiani. Amnesty International has stated that the charges against her were ""unfair"" and that she has been subjected to torture and other forms of mistreatment while in detention. Ashtiani's case has drawn international attention to the issue of stoning, which is still a legal form of punishment in Iran. In recent years, the use of stoning as a form of punishment has been increasingly criticized by the international community, with many human rights organizations arguing that it is a cruel and inhumane practice. Despite these criticisms, the Iranian government has defended the use of stoning, arguing that it is an appropriate punishment for crimes such as adultery and murder. However, Ashtiani's case has highlighted the arbitrary nature of the Iranian justice system, which has been accused of using stoning as a means of political repression. Ashtiani's family has consistently denied the government's claim that she was convicted of murder, and has called for her release. The family has also accused Iranian authorities of intimidating them and preventing them from speaking out about Ashtiani's case. Ashtiani's case is just one example of the many human rights abuses that occur in Iran on a regular basis. Human rights organizations have criticized the Iranian government for its treatment of political dissidents, journalists, and women's rights activists, among other groups. Ashtiani's potential execution has sparked outrage around the world, with many calling for the Iranian government to intervene and save her life. It remains to be seen whether the Iranian authorities will heed these calls, or whether they will continue to enforce their harsh and unjust legal system.","(470, 19)","(CNN) -- Authorities in Tehran, Iran, have given the go-ahead to execute a woman who

Sakineh Mohammdi Ashtiani, 43, could be put to death as soon as Wednesday, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported.
Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006 after her husband accused her of having an affair with two men. She was sentenced to 99 lashes for having an extramarital affair and 10 years in prison for playing a role in the death of her husband, who was killed in a fight with one of the men with whom she was alleged to have had an affair, according to Amnesty International.
Her sentence was later changed to execution by stoning, a punishment that has been condemned by human rights groups around the world.
Ashtiani's son, Sajad Qaderzadeh, told CNN that his mother was convicted of murdering her husband, not of adultery.
""She was convicted of killing her husband,"" he said. ""She didn't kill her husband. Her husband was killed by someone else.""
Qaderzadeh said his mother was lashed 99 times in 2006, but he did not know if she received the 10-year prison sentence.
""I don't know if she went to jail or not,"" he said.
Iranian authorities have denied that Ashtiani was sentenced to death for adultery, saying she was convicted of being an accomplice in her husband's murder, according to the semiofficial ISNA news agency.
""Ms. Ashtiani has been sentenced to death for her role in the murder of her husband,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said, according to ISNA. ""She was not sentenced to death for committing adultery.""
Mehmanparast said Ashtiani's case would be reviewed by Iran's Supreme Court.
Amnesty International called on Iranian authorities to halt Ashtiani's execution.
""The Iranian authorities must immediately halt any plans to execute Sakineh Mohammedi Ashtiani,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa.
""Sakineh Ashtiani has already been subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,"" Sahraoui said in a statement. ""If she is executed, it will be yet another example of the Iranian authorities' callous disregard for human life.""","(431, 19)","(CNN) -- Authorities in Tehran, Iran, have given the go-ahead to execute a woman who

The letter, which was published on the group's Web site, said the couple's marriage
had been arranged by their families.
""My husband and I did not love each other,"" Ashtiani wrote in the letter. ""He was a
drunkard and a drug addict.""
The letter also said that she had been forced to confess to the murder.

","The world of football reacted with the same disbelief shared by the rest of the planet while watching Germany's 7-1 humiliation of hosts Brazil in the semi-finals of the World Cup. Brazil's dream of winning the tournament in their home country was effectively ended after the Germans scored five goals in the first 29minutes - the fastest time it has ever taken a team to reach that number in World Cup history - on a night when the record books were being rewritten practicallly every time Joachim Low's side touched the ball. The likes of Theo Walcott, Radamel Falcao and Daniel Sturridge took to social media as the Twittersphere seemed to collectively pinch itself to confirm the shock result was a reality.

The defeat will undoubtedly go down as one of the most humiliating in World Cup history, and one that will be etched in the memory of Brazilian fans for years to come. The match started poorly for Brazil as Germany took the lead after just 11 minutes through Thomas Muller. However, it was the second-half that proved to be catastrophic for the host nation, as Germany scored four goals within just six minutes. Brazil was left shell-shocked and unable to mount any sort of comeback, despite pulling one back through Oscar. The defeat sparked a flood of reactions on social media, as players from around the world took to Twitter to express their shock and disbelief. England's Daniel Sturridge tweeted ""Wow, what did I just witness? That was unbelievable,"" while Arsenal's Theo Walcott simply said ""7-1.. ouch!""  Radamel Falcao, the Colombian striker who was forced to miss the World Cup through injury, also weighed in, saying ""A sad day for Brazilian football. I hope this helps all of us reflect on the things that truly matter. Congratulations Germany, great team.""  The result was a stark reminder of the gulf in class between the two sides, as Germany displayed a level of skill, organization and discipline that Brazil simply could not match. It was a triumph for Germany's coach, Joachim Low, who had been criticized in the run-up to the tournament for his team selection and tactics. For Brazil, the result will lead to a period of soul-searching and introspection. Just four years after winning the Copa America and Confederations Cup, the team has now suffered two humiliating defeats in major international tournaments, following their 3-0 loss to the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup third-place playoff. The defeat is also a huge blow to the Brazilian economy, as the country had invested billions of dollars in infrastructure, transportation systems and security in order to host the tournament. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff expressed her disappointment, saying ""Today was a tragic day for all Brazilians. We must learn from this experience and work together to ensure that we can still achieve our dreams and aspirations."" As the dust settles on a shocking evening in Belo Horizonte, attention will turn to Sunday's final between Germany and Argentina.

","By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:49 EST, 26 November 2011 . It is one of the defining images of Christmas, as children cosy up to Santa on his knee to tell him exactly what presents they want. But in an age of 'government guidance' and overcautious school bosses, it was only a matter of time before it became a tradition of the past. A rising number of schools are now forbidding children from sitting on Santa's knee, with increasing numbers of teachers banning any physically contact with Santa at all. Thing of the past: The scene of children sitting on Santa's knee could be over after government guidance suggested there should be no physical contact between Father Christmas and children. With those playing 'Santa' no longer required to pass a CRB check, more and more schools are opting to 'err' on the side of caution and impose strict rules on children visiting Father Christmas. Parents who volunteer for the role of Santa don't have to undergo CRB checks as they do not come into regular contact with children. But those who want to don the red suit and big festive white beard can now only do in many schools as long as they are not left alone with the children and don't let them sit on their laps. Government guidance now states: 'Under no circumstances must a volunteer who has not obtained a CRB disclosure... be left unsupervised with children.' Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told the Daily Telegraph this ruling meant many members had decided it is better if Santa avoided all physical contact with children. He said: 'The climate we work in, and the risk of getting it wrong, mean many school leaders err on the side of cuation. 'And if you are going to 'err' on the side of caution, that's the side most parents would prefer.' A spokesman for the Department for Education said children could still sit on Father Christmas’s knee as long as parents were consulted and were 'completely comfortable' with the situation. Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, told the Telegraph: 'It would be a great shame if misinterpretation of regulations deterred schools from traditional festive celebrations.'","(422, 17)","Parents are being warned not to leave their children alone with Santa Claus this Christmas season, according to updated government guidance issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. The guidance highlights the importance of safeguarding children and states that it is not safe to assume that Santa can be trusted to be alone with children. Although Santa is a beloved figure around the world, there have been instances in the past where individuals dressed as Santa have abused children. The updated guidance serves as a reminder that even during joyful festivities, parents must remain vigilant. “While it is important for children to experience the magic of Christmas, parents must ensure that their children remain safe at all times,” the guidance warns. “It is crucial to remember that Santa cannot be left with children unsupervised.” The guidance goes on to state that in situations where Santa is visiting a school or community event, there should always be at least one other adult present. The guidance also advises that all adults working with children should have a valid DBS check. The updated guidance has been welcomed by child protection groups, who have long called for greater safeguards around interactions between children and adults dressed as Santa. A spokesperson for the NSPCC said, “It is vital that parents remain alert to the potential risks associated with leaving their children alone with someone dressed as Santa. While the overwhelming majority of Santa actors are trustworthy, there are some individuals who use the guise of Santa as a means to gain access to children.” The Department of Health and Social Care has stressed that the guidance is intended to provide practical advice to parents and schools during the festive season. The government has also announced plans to roll out a nationwide campaign to raise awareness of the importance of safeguarding children during the Christmas period. As the festive season approaches, it is important that all of us remain vigilant and safeguard children from potential risks. Parents are reminded that Santa is not immune to the need for supervision and caution, even while spreading Christmas cheer.","(383, 13)","By. Daily Mail Reporter.

may be the season of goodwill, but parents have been warned not to leave
Santa with their children unsupervised.
Government guidance stresses that the jolly old elf cannot be left with
children unsupervised, even for a short period of time.
The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) has issued the
advice as part of its 'Keeping Children Safe in Education' document.
It states: 'Children should never be left unsupervised. This includes
leaving children at home alone for brief periods of time, for example, if
a parent or carer goes out briefly to post a letter.
'This also includes leaving a child unattended while you do an errand,
such as going to the corner shop, or leaving them alone in a parked car
while you run another errand. Children should never be left in a closed
vehicle, for example, a caravan or a car, even if it is in the back garden
or on a driveway.
'Leaving a child unattended in a car is dangerous, since in hot weather
the temperature can quickly become too high for the child, and in cold
weather the child could suffer from hypothermia.'
The guidance adds: 'Children should not be left in charge of younger
children as they are unlikely to be able to respond appropriately in an
emergency and may put themselves and the younger child at risk.
'For example, a child might let a younger child play on the road, open
cupboards when they have been told not to, or let the dog out when it
should be kept indoors.
'Parents and carers should not rely on other people, such as friends or
neighbours, to keep an eye on their children. Parents and carers should
not assume that older children will automatically know what to do to keep
themselves safe.'","(352, 16)","By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:49 EST, 26 November 2011 . It
is the most wonderful time of the year - and Santa Claus is coming to town.
But the jolly old elf will have to be on his best behaviour if he wants to
deliver presents to the good boys and girls of Britain this Christmas.
Government guidance stresses that Santa Claus 'must not be left with
children unsupervised'.
The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) said: 'Santa
Claus must not be left unsupervised with children.
'He must be accompanied by a responsible adult at all times.
'Santa Claus must not enter a child's bedroom without the permission of
the child's parent or guardian.'
The BIS added: 'It is important to remember that Santa Claus is a fictional
character and should not be used as an excuse for children to misbehave.
'It is the responsibility of parents and guardians to ensure that their
children understand the difference between fantasy and reality.'
The guidance also states that Santa Claus should not be left alone with
children under the age of 12.
It adds: 'Parents and guardians should ensure that children are supervised
at all times when they are in the company of Santa Claus.
'Children should be encouraged to tell their parents or guardians if
they feel uncomfortable or threatened in the presence of Santa Claus.'
The guidelines also state that children should not be allowed to sit on
Santa Claus's knee.
They say: 'Children should not be encouraged to sit on Santa Claus's
knee.
'If a child asks to sit on his knee, parents and guardians should explain
that Santa Claus is not a real person and that it is not appropriate
for children to sit on the knee of an adult they do not know.
'They should also explain that it is important to respect other people's
personal space.'
The document also states that children should be discouraged from asking
Santa Claus for presents.
It says: 'When children ask Santa Claus for a present, parents and
guardians should explain that Santa Claus does not bring presents to
children who do not believe in him.
'This should be done in an age-appropriate way, depending on the child's
age and level of understanding.'","(420, 22)","By. Daily Mail Reporter. UPDATED:. 16:49 EST, 26 November 2011. It

deliver presents to the good boys and girls of Britain this Christmas.
Government guidance stresses that Santa Claus 'must not be left with
children unsupervised'.
The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) said: 'Santa
Claus must not be left unsupervised with children.
'He must be accompanied by a responsible adult at all times.
'Santa Claus must not enter a child's bedroom without the permission of
the child's parent or guardian.'
The BIS added: 'It is important to remember that Santa Claus is a fictional
character and should not be used as an excuse for children to misbehave.
'It is the responsibility of parents and guardians to ensure that their
children understand the difference between fantasy and reality.'
The guidance also states that Santa Claus should not be left alone with
children under the age of 12.
It adds: 'Parents and guardians should ensure that children are supervised
at all times when they are in the company of Santa Claus.
'Children should be encouraged to tell their parents or guardians if
they feel uncomfortable or threatened in the presence of Santa Claus.'
The guidelines also state that children should not be allowed to sit on
Santa Claus's knee.
They say: 'Children should not be encouraged to sit on Santa Claus's
knee.
'If a child asks to sit on his knee, parents and guardians should explain
that Santa Claus is not a real person and that it is not appropriate
for children to sit on the knee of an adult they do not know.
'They should also explain that it is important to respect other people's
personal space.'
The document also states that children should be discouraged from asking
Santa Claus for presents.
It says: 'When children ask Santa Claus for a present, parents and
guardians should explain that Santa Claus does not bring presents to
children who do not believe in him.
'This should be done in an age-appropriate way, depending on the child's
age and level of understanding.'","(352, 16)","(417, 22)"

Wealthy parents pass on three quarters of their fortunes to their children meaning it will
","Wealthy parents pass on three quarters of their fortunes to their children meaning it will take 300 years for the offspring of today's super-rich to have average incomes, a survey has revealed. The sons and daughters of prestigious families are also likely to live longer than average, more likely to attend Oxbridge, live in expensive houses, and go on to become doctors or lawyers. There is also little difference in wealth or social standing when the richest families of the Victoria era are compared to their descendants today, according to the study. Scroll down for video . The study of 19,000 people, including 600 with rare surnames such as Pepys (after the noted diarist, pictured), found their modern-day descendants are just as wealthy as their Victorian counterparts . Publishing their findings in the Economic Journal, Professor Gregory Clark and Dr Neil Cummins said: 'What your great-great-grandfather was doing is still predictive of what you are doing now.' The pair examined the records of 19,000 people, including more than 600 rare family names such as Bazalgette, the Pepys, and Bigge. Joseph Bazalgette was responsible for building the world's first sewer system in London in the 19th century, the Pepys family tree contains noted diarist Samuel Pepys, and John Bigge was a judge and royal commissioner. They found that, compared to their relatives in 1850, those living with that surname today are almost certain to have amassed fortunes well beyond the reach of the average Briton. For example Sir Peter Bazalgette, the great-great-grandson of Sir Joseph, is the founder of Endemol television production company which created Big Brother and Deal or No Deal. The company was floated on the Dutch stock exchange in 2005. It trebled in value and was sold for £2.5billion in 2007. Survey estimates three quarters of any fortune is passed from parents to their children, meaning it will take 300 years for the offspring of today's super-rich to be as wealthy as the average Briton . The findings of Dr Clark and Dr Cummins, reported by The Guardian, suggest that the passing down of wealth has a far bigger impact on society than previously thought. The data showed a 'significant correlation between the wealth of families' even up to five generations apart. They estimate that three quarters of any estate is passed down to the offspring of wealthy families, despite inheritance taxes introduced in recent years. At that rate, it means that children of today's super-wealthy would take, on average, nearly three centuries to become as wealthy as the average Briton. Dr Clark and Dr Cummins said: 'Wilson, Thatcher, or Blair – the noisy cacophony of Westminster politics – makes no difference to the iron law of inheritance. 'Measures to promote social mobility have little prospect of succeeding. It’s always going to be the case that families with the greatest abilities will just pass them on to their children.'","(538, 20)","According to a recent study, modern-day descendants of wealthy Victorian families are just as financially well-off as their ancestors. Researchers surveyed 19,000 individuals, including 600 individuals with rare last names such as Pepys, and found that the offspring of today's elite will take 300 years to reach average wealth. The study, which was conducted across the United Kingdom, is one of the largest of its kind. The research team analyzed public records on wealth and documented the financial status of families over multiple generations. They also took into consideration the impact of inflation, taxes, and other economic factors. The results of the study showed that individuals with rare surnames such as Pepys were significantly wealthier than those with more common names. The researchers concluded that this is likely due to the fact that these families were able to pass down their wealth through multiple generations. Furthermore, the study found that it will take the offspring of today's wealthy families several centuries to reach the average level of wealth. This suggests that social mobility in the United Kingdom is limited, and that there is a persistent wealth gap between the elite and the rest of society. The researchers were quick to note that inherited wealth does not guarantee personal success or happiness. However, they did acknowledge that the financial stability and opportunities that come with wealth can provide a significant advantage. The findings of this study have important implications for policymakers and advocates for social justice. If social mobility in the United Kingdom is limited, it may be necessary to implement policies that address this issue. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of providing equal opportunities for all individuals regardless of their family background. Overall, this study sheds light on the persistence of wealth inequality in the United Kingdom. While modern-day descendants of wealthy Victorian families may continue to enjoy financial success, it is clear that social mobility remains a significant challenge for those outside the elite.","(358, 16)","Wealthy parents pass on three quarters of their fortunes to their children meaning it will
take 300 years for the offspring of today’s rich to reach the average wealth of the population,
according to a new study.
Researchers from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) looked at the
inheritances of 19,000 British people who died between 1891 and 2011. They found that the
offspring of those who died in 1891 had an average wealth of £2,500, while the offspring of
those who died in 2011 had an average of £200,000.
The study, published in the Journal of Economic History, also found that modern-day
descendants of wealthy Victorians are just as rich as their ancestors. This is despite the fact
that the value of the pound has increased by more than 1,000% since 1891.
The findings suggest that wealth is passed down through the generations, rather than being
diluted over time. The researchers say this is because wealthy families tend to have more
children, and those children are more likely to inherit their parents’ wealth.
However, the study also found that there is a limit to how much wealth can be passed down
from one generation to the next. Once a family’s wealth reaches a certain level, it becomes
more difficult to pass it on to the next generation. This is because the children of wealthy
families are more likely to spend their inheritance on luxury goods and services, rather than
investing it in assets that can be passed down to future generations.
The researchers say their findings have important implications for public policy. They argue
that governments should do more to encourage wealthy families to pass on their wealth to
future generations, rather than spending it on themselves. This could be done through tax
incentives or other measures that make it easier for wealthy families to leave their wealth to
their children.
Overall, the study provides new insights into the ways in which wealth is passed down
through the generations. It suggests that wealth is not evenly distributed across society, but
rather tends to concentrate in the hands of a small number of families. This has important
implications for social mobility and inequality, and highlights the need for policies that
promote greater equality of opportunity.","(415, 16)","Wealthy parents pass on three quarters of their fortunes to their children meaning it will

The Berwyn police had to intervene and went to the house in question to investigate the issue. According to a neighbor, a family of three, including a woman who volunteers at animal shelters, lived in the house targeted. The neighbor spoke to reporters, stating that they had heard loud noises and disruptions for a few weeks, leading them to suspect an animal infestation in the property. The police and animal control personnel initially planned to use a variety of techniques to catch the animals, including live traps and baited cages. They set up traps on the property and waited patiently for results. The neighbor who reported the incident spoke to reporters and said, “I called the police because I’ve been hearing this constant scratching noise coming from the crawl space under my house. It’s been keeping me up at night, and I’m concerned about what kind of animals might be down there.” The police and animal control workers were able to place the traps and patiently waited to observe the movement of the animals. After several hours of waiting, two raccoons were successfully caught in the traps. Animal control workers were able to transport the captured raccoons to a safe location without causing harm to either the animals or any humans involved. The neighbors were relieved that the issue had been resolved without any injuries or property damage. Berwyn police reminded residents to be aware of the wildlife in their neighborhoods and to contact animal control or the police department in any case of disturbance. This case shows how important it is to have effective communication between residents, the police department, and animal control in maintaining public safety. It also highlights the importance of taking appropriate measures to resolve matters related to animal welfare, including setting up traps, catching animals and relocating them in a safe, humane manner.","(365, 14)","By.

London-based photographer Carl Warner has turned nude, muscular bodies into these clever optical illusions that look like desert landscapes. Warner's photographs for the series are made up entirely of naked forms and interestingly each picture is only made up of different angles of the same person. Each composition is a single shot of one contorted volunteer, or a composition of different angles of the same body. Shin Knee Valley: These 'bodyscapes' by London-based photographer Carl Warner look almost like sand dunes but are in fact legs manipulated by Photoshop . Valley of the Reclining Woman: Carl Warner photographs human forms then cuts them together to create new ways of looking at the body . Shoulder Hill Valley: This undulation of shoulders and backs looks like an arid landscape but is in fact a mixture of different backs . Headless Horizon: This desert terrain is the dip between a man's shoulder blades, lit from above . At first glance they are desert terrains . and mountains but the longer viewers look the clearer the constituent . body parts become. Warner is best known for his visual trickery for years with his playful Foodscapes series, which featured landscapes constructed entirely from fruits and vegetables, cheeses, breads, fish, meat and grains. Like his celebrated foodwork, with memorable tropical scenes created out of materials such as smoked salmon and potatoes, his Bodyscapes are not what they initially appear. Explaining his still life work, he explains that he want to focus attention on 'one person’s body, creating a sense of place so that a body that is lived in becomes a place to live.' The Desert of Sleeping Men: This optical illusion of a valley is made up of the same volunteer's head reproduced and cut together . The Cave of Abdo-Men: Looking through toned torsos, the legs look like rocky outcrops in the distance . Twin Peaks: A pair of pointy elbows make for convincing mountains .

Using Photoshop and unique lighting techniques, Warner transforms different parts of the human body into stunning landscapes that leave viewers mesmerized. From desert scenes to mountain ranges, Warner's ""Bodyscapes"" project captures the beauty of the human form in a way that has never been seen before. By carefully selecting specific body parts, like a pair of hands or a foot, and turning them into abstract landscapes with Photoshop, Warner creates a unique effect that is both beautiful and eerie. The results of Warner's project are stunning, with each piece carefully crafted to evoke a sense of wonder and amazement. The desert scenes, in particular, are breathtaking, with sand dunes and rock formations made entirely out of human flesh. ""I wanted to create something that was both beautiful and strange,"" said Warner. ""The human body is such a fascinating subject, and I knew that I could create something truly unique by using it in a different way."" To achieve the desired effect, Warner used a combination of unusual lighting techniques and Photoshop to create the illusion of depth and texture. By carefully placing lights and shadows on different parts of the body, he was able to create the illusion of mountains, valleys, and other features found in natural landscapes. The ""Bodyscapes"" project has already gained a lot of attention, with many viewers praising Warner's unique approach and artistic vision. The photographs have been shared widely on social media, with many people expressing their amazement and admiration for the project. ""I have never seen anything like this before,"" said one viewer. ""It's amazing to see the human body transformed into something so beautiful and surreal."" Another viewer commented, ""These photographs are truly a work of art. Carl Warner has an incredible eye for detail and an amazing talent for turning the ordinary into something extraordinary."" Overall, ""Bodyscapes"" is a thought-provoking project that challenges our perceptions of the human body and its relationship to the natural world. By transforming flesh into landscape, Warner has created a series of images that are as captivating as they are unique.","(436, 18)","By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 11:40 EST, 1 August 2013. |
Using Photoshop and unusual lighting, photographer Carl Warner has turned the human body into a desert scene in his latest art project. The 50-year-old artist took parts of the human anatomy and turned them into curious landscapes for his new book, Bodyscapes. In one image, a man's back is transformed into a mountainous landscape, while another shows a woman's torso as a desert with cacti growing out of her skin. Mr Warner, who lives in London, said: 'I wanted to create a series of images that explored the relationship between the human body and the natural world. 'I have always been fascinated by the idea of the human body as a landscape, and I wanted to explore this idea in a way that was both visually striking and thought-provoking.' To create the images, Mr Warner used a combination of Photoshop and unusual lighting techniques. He said: 'I started by taking photographs of the human body in a variety of poses and positions. 'Then, using Photoshop, I manipulated the images to create the desired effect. 'For example, I might take a photograph of a person's back and then use Photoshop to make it look like a mountainous landscape. 'I also used unusual lighting techniques to create a sense of depth and perspective in the images.' Mr Warner said he was inspired by the work of artists such as Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte, who were known for their use of surrealism and optical illusions. He added: 'I hope that people will be able to look at these images and see something new and unexpected. 'I also hope that they will be able to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the human body, and the ways in which it can be used to create art.'

In one image, a man's back is transformed into a mountainous landscape, while another shows a woman's torso as a desert with cacti growing out of her skin. Mr Warner, who lives in London, said: 'I wanted to create a series of images that explored the relationship between the human body and the natural world. 'I have always been fascinated by the idea of the human body as a landscape, and I wanted to explore this idea in a way that was both visually striking and thought-provoking.' To create the images, Mr Warner used a combination of Photoshop and unusual lighting techniques. He said: 'I started by taking photographs of the human body in a variety of poses and positions. 'Then, using Photoshop, I manipulated the images to create the desired effect. 'For example, I might take a photograph of a person's back and then use Photoshop to make it look like a mountainous landscape. 'I also used unusual lighting techniques to create a sense of depth and perspective in the images.' Mr Warner said he was inspired by the work of artists such as Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte, who were known for their use of surrealism and optical illusions. He added: 'I hope that people will be able to look at these images and see something new and unexpected. 'I also hope that they will be able to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the human body, and the ways in which it can be used to create art.' Bodyscapes is published by Thames & Hudson and is available now.","By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:40 EST, 1 August 2013 . |

","By . Brendan Carlin . PUBLISHED: . 20:09 EST, 20 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:09 EST, 20 April 2013 . Backlash: Ed Milliband invited Respect MP Mr Galloway to his Commons office . Ed Miliband last night faced an angry backlash from Labour MPs after it emerged he held a secret meeting with George Galloway, who was thrown out of the party ten years ago. The Labour leader invited Respect MP Mr Galloway to his Commons office, where they had a ‘cordial and friendly conversation’ for nearly an hour. It has sparked rumours that Mr Miliband is considering allowing Mr Galloway to rejoin the party. But Labour MPs warned their leader . against taking such action. ‘Galloway is a traitor,’ said one. ‘It’s . naive lunacy for the leader to have anything to do with him. I thought . he wanted to get rid of the Red Ed tag. He will rejoin Labour over my . dead body.’ Mr Galloway was expelled from Labour . after he was accused of inciting foreign forces to rise up against . British troops invading Iraq – military action he strongly opposed. Last year, Mr Galloway humiliated Mr . Miliband by triumphing over Labour in the Bradford West by- election by a . thumping 10,000 votes. If he returned to his former party, it could give Mr Miliband an extra seat at the next General Election in 2015. Mr Miliband believes that winning seats in Labour’s northern stronghold is key to him ousting David Cameron from No  10. Controversial character: George Galloway MP, formerly of the Labour Party . Senior Labour sources denied there were plans to let Mr Galloway rejoin the party, saying it was ‘merely a get to know you’ meeting. But friends of Mr Galloway said he was ‘taken aback’ to receive the invitation. ‘Obviously it was an olive branch,’ said one. ‘It is hard to imagine why Ed would want to see him unless he is thinking of letting George back in. They had a very friendly chat and agreed to stay in touch. At one point in the meeting, Mr Miliband asked Mr Galloway why he had left the party. He replied, ‘I didn’t leave, I was thrown out.’ Both men laughed. News of the meeting, said to have taken place a few weeks ago, was leaked days after Mr Galloway greeted Margaret Thatcher’s death by saying: ‘May she burn in the hellfires.’ In 2006, he was ridiculed after taking time off from his MP’s duties to appear on Celebrity Big Brother. During one episode he pretended to be a cat. Labour last night confirmed the meeting took place but insisted there had been no attempt to bring Mr Galloway back into the party as many of his views were ‘unacceptable’.","(536, 38)","In an effort to distance himself from the ""Red Ed"" tag and improve his image with the public, Labour leader Ed Miliband has made a startling revelation. However, many experts believe that the news will do little to help him in his endeavors. At a recent press conference, Miliband announced that he had recently discovered that controversial politician George Galloway had been thrown out of the Labour party ten years ago. Galloway was expelled from the party following comments he made about the Iraq war, which were seen as divisive and damaging to the party's reputation. Miliband claimed that he had no knowledge of Galloway's past with the party until recently, and praised the decision to expel him. However, many political analysts are skeptical that this revelation will do much to improve Miliband's image. ""Frankly, I don't think anyone's going to see this as a game-changer,"" said political commentator John Smith. ""Most people won't even remember who George Galloway is, let alone care that he was expelled from the Labour party ten years ago."" Smith's sentiments were echoed by many others in the political world, who feel that Miliband is fighting an uphill battle when it comes to his public image. ""The fact of the matter is that Miliband has struggled to connect with the public since he became leader,"" said political strategist Sarah Johnson. ""He hasn't been able to shake the 'Red Ed' label, and while this revelation might be interesting from a historical perspective, I don't think it's going to have much of an impact on his current standing with the public."" Indeed, recent polls show that Miliband's approval rating remains stubbornly low, with many voters saying they simply don't find him charismatic or inspiring. Despite this, Miliband has remained upbeat in recent weeks, launching a strong campaign against Conservative plans to cut welfare benefits and implementing new policies aimed at improving the lives of ordinary people. ""It's true that I have a lot of work to do when it comes to my public image,"" Miliband admitted in a recent interview. ""But I'm confident that if I keep focusing on the issues that matter to people, and keep putting forward strong policies that will make a real difference in their lives, I can turn things around."" Whether or not his strategy will be successful remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Miliband will need to work hard to shake the ""Red Ed"" tag and win over the hearts and minds of the British public.","(487, 16)","By.

Revelation will do nothing for Miliband trying to shake ‘Red Ed’ tag
George Galloway was kicked out of the party 10 years ago
Labour leader Ed Miliband has been dealt a fresh blow after it emerged that his father Ralph was a member of the Communist Party in the 1940s.
The revelation will do nothing to help Mr Miliband’s attempts to shake off his ‘Red Ed’ image as he seeks to become Prime Minister.
Mr Miliband’s father, who died in 1994, joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1941 and remained a member until 1956, when he resigned in protest at the Soviet Union’s suppression of the Hungarian uprising.

A spokesman for Mr Miliband said last night: ‘Ralph Miliband joined the Communist Party in 1941. He left the party in 1956 in protest at the invasion of Hungary.’
He added: ‘Ed Miliband has never been a member of any political party other than the Labour Party.’
It is understood that Mr Miliband did not know about his father’s membership of the CPGB until after he became Labour leader in 2010.

He wrote several books, including Parliamentary Socialism (1961), The State In Capitalist Society (1969) and Marxism and Politics (1977). He died aged 69 in 1994.

(CNN) -- Nigeria's president has backed down on his decision to suspend the national soccer
","(CNN) -- Nigeria's president has backed down on his decision to suspend the national soccer team, according to the African country's football federation. The announcement came just before Monday's deadline set by world governing body FIFA, which had threatened to expel Nigeria completely if the ruling was not overturned and also withhold $8 million due for participating at the World Cup. Nigerian leader Goodluck Jonathan was so angry with the Super Eagles' poor performance in South Africa that he decided to suspend the national team at all levels for two years. ""The President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, on Monday graciously rescinded last Wednesday's decision to withdraw Nigerian national football teams from FIFA/CAF football competitions,"" the federation said in a statement. ""The decision was made known at the presidential villa on Monday evening as President Jonathan hearkened to the passionate appeals of top officials of the National Sports Commission, the Nigeria Football Federation, other concerned organs of government and well-meaning Nigerians on the matter."" Nigerian leader's 'Obama moment' Nine members of the NFF's executive committee had earlier been dismissed, including president Sani Lulu and vice-president Amanze Uchegbulam, the UK Press Association reported on Monday. After hearing of Jonathan's June 30 decision, FIFA wrote to the NFF on Friday warning it of the possible ramifications if the Monday deadline was not met. Two-time African champions Nigeria finished bottom of Group B at the World Cup after one draw and two defeats. The Super Eagles brought in former Sweden coach Lars Lagerback after finishing third at the Africa Cup of Nations in January, but he was unable to lift the team's fortunes in matches against Argentina, Greece and South Korea.","(327, 9)","In a recent turn of events, the ban on Nigeria's national football team has been rescinded by the African country's president. President Goodluck Jonathan had initially imposed the ban on all Nigerian national teams for two years following the Super Eagles' poor showing at the World Cup in South Africa. However, world governing body FIFA had given Nigeria a Monday deadline to overturn the decision. The ban had sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from football enthusiasts and stakeholders alike. Many believed that it was a harsh and unjustifiable punishment that could harm the development of football in Nigeria. The country has produced many talented footballers over the years and has a passionate fan base that supports the national team through thick and thin. Fortunately, President Jonathan has now heeded the call to reverse the ban, signaling a welcome relief to the Nigerian football community. The decision to lift the ban was a wise one; it provides an opportunity for the Super Eagles to bounce back from their disappointment at the World Cup and start a new era. Additionally, it demonstrates the government's commitment to supporting the sport in the country. The Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) has also welcomed the decision to overturn the ban. The federation's president, Amaju Pinnick, praised President Jonathan for his proactivitiy and responsiveness to the plight of Nigerian football. Speaking to reporters, Pinnick said, ""We are thrilled to have the ban lifted. This is a new beginning for Nigerian football, and we are confident that we can regain our rightful place on the global football stage."" In conclusion, the rescinding of the ban on Nigeria's national football team is good news for football enthusiasts not just in Nigeria, but the world over. It sends a strong message of support for the sport and provides an opportunity for the Super Eagles to chart a new course towards greater success.","(350, 15)","(CNN) -- Nigeria's president has backed down on his decision to suspend the national soccer
team from international competition for two years.
President Goodluck Jonathan made the announcement in a televised address to the nation on
Monday, just hours before FIFA, soccer's world governing body, was due to decide whether to
impose its own ban on the West African nation.
""I have decided to lift the suspension of the Super Eagles,"" Jonathan said. ""I have also
decided to lift the ban on all other national teams.""
FIFA had given Nigeria until Monday to overturn Jonathan's decision or face a two-year
suspension from all international competitions, including the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
Jonathan had been furious after the Super Eagles failed to win a single game at the World
Cup in South Africa last year, finishing bottom of their group with just one point from three
matches. The team's dismal performance led to widespread criticism of the players and the
Nigerian Football Federation (NFF), who were accused of failing to prepare the team properly
for the tournament.
In response, Jonathan ordered the NFF to suspend all national teams from international
competition for two years. He also called for the resignation of the federation's president,
Alhaji Aminu Maigari.
However, the NFF refused to comply with the president's order, arguing that it did not have
the legal authority to do so. The matter was then taken to court, where a judge ruled that
the NFF could not be forced to suspend the national teams.
Despite this setback, Jonathan remained determined to punish the NFF for its failure to
prepare the Super Eagles properly for the World Cup. He even went so far as to threaten to
dissolve the federation if it did not comply with his order.
However, it seems that the president has now changed his mind. In his televised address, he
said that he had decided to lift the suspensions because he wanted to give the NFF a chance
to improve the performance of the national teams.
""I believe that the NFF has learned from its mistakes and is now taking steps to ensure that
the national teams are better prepared for future tournaments,"" Jonathan said.
It remains to be seen whether the NFF will be able to turn things around and improve the
performance of the national teams. However, it is clear that the president's decision to lift
the suspensions has given the federation a new lease of life.

The Virginia man who pleaded guilty to shooting a Family Research Council employee last year
","The Virginia man who pleaded guilty to shooting a Family Research Council employee last year was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison. Floyd Corkins has said he disagreed with the Family Research Council's stance against gay marriage. The shooting took place at the conservative policy group's office in Washington. The research council, a Christian group that focuses on family, anti-abortion and religious liberty issues, views homosexuality as harmful. Before sentencing, Corkins expressed remorse to building manager Leo Johnson, who Corkins shot in the arm. ""I realize resorting to violence to achieve political ends is never OK,"" Corkins said. Johnson, who struggled with Corkins and disarmed him, also spoke before the sentencing. ""I forgive you but I do not forget,"" he said. ""If you believe in God you should pray to him every day because not only did God save my life that day, he saved yours, too."" Johnson said he didn't shoot Corkins after managing to get control of the gun because God spoke to him and told him not to do so. Corkins, 29, pleaded guilty in February to committing an act of terrorism while armed, assault with intent to kill while armed and interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition. David Bos, Corkins' federal public defender, said his client was diagnosed with a mental illness six months before the August 2012 shooting and starting taking prescribed medication. Bos said that didn't excuse the shooting but should be taken into account.  The lawyer recommended Corkins receive a sentence of 11 years and three months. Prosecutors argued Corkins should receive 45 years in prison. The government said Corkins did suffer from mental illness but wanted to take medication only so he could think more clearly about his plot. Prosecutors said Corkins was able to carefully plan, rehearse and then conduct his attack. If Johnson had not interceded, they argued, many people at the Family Research Council might have been killed or wounded. ""Earlier this week we were reminded what the consequences can be of one man well-armed,"" said prosecutor Patrick Martin. ""Mr. Corkins was no less determined than the Navy Yard gunman."" When Corkins was arrested investigators found 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches in his backpack.  He told the FBI he planned to kill as many people as he could at the research council and then smash the sandwiches in their faces. The head of Chick-fil-A had announced opposition to gay marriage. ""Today's 25-year prison sentence demonstrates the steep price to be paid for turning to violence to terrorize your political enemies,"" said U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen.","(489, 24)","In 2012, a tragic shooting occurred at the headquarters of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian organization based in Washington, D.C. The shooter, a man named Floyd Corkins, entered the building armed with a gun and hatred in his heart. He disagreed vehemently with the council's stance against gay marriage and had planned to carry out a deadly attack. However, he was stopped in his tracks by a brave young man named Leo Johnson. Johnson, who was working as a security guard at the time, physically tackled Corkins and disarmed him. In a moment of extraordinary courage, he prevented a potentially catastrophic loss of life. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Johnson was hailed as a hero. But despite the trauma and danger he had faced, he expressed an inspirational message of compassion and forgiveness. Speaking to the media, he said: ""I forgive him, but I do not forget."" It was a powerful message that set an example of Christian love and grace in the face of evil. The incident highlighted the extreme divisions and tensions that exist in American society over social issues like same-sex marriage. The Family Research Council is a conservative organization that advocates for traditional values and Biblical teachings on marriage, family, and morality. They take a strong stance against the LGBT community and their efforts to gain equal rights. Corkins, who was openly gay himself, had been motivated by a twisted ideology of hatred and resentment towards those who disagreed with his views. His actions were a shocking reminder of the potential for violence and fanaticism on both sides of the issue. In the years since the shooting, the Family Research Council has continued to be a lightning rod for controversy and criticism. Many progressives and activists see them as a hateful and intolerant organization that spreads harmful messages of discrimination and prejudice. However, the council maintains that they are simply standing up for traditional morals and values that have been a part of the Christian faith for centuries. They argue that their advocacy for traditional marriage and family values is rooted in a deep concern for the well-being of society as a whole. The legacy of the shooting at the Family Research Council lives on as a reminder of the power of forgiveness and grace in the face of hatred and violence. Leo Johnson's words of forgiveness and determination are a testament to the loving heart of the Christian faith, even in the midst of great adversity. As we continue to grapple with issues of social justice and equality in our society, it is important to remember the example set by Johnson and other people of faith who choose to respond to anger and hate with love and forgiveness. Only by embracing these principles can we hope to build a better world for ourselves and our fellow human beings.","(526, 23)","The Virginia man who pleaded guilty to shooting a Family Research Council employee last year

Corkins pleaded guilty in October to three charges: interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition, assault with intent to kill while armed, and committing an act of terrorism while armed.
Corkins was arrested Aug. 15, 2012, after he entered the lobby of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group that opposes same-sex marriage, and opened fire on a security guard.

Corkins told investigators that he intended to kill as many people as possible and then smear the victims' faces with Chick-fil-A sandwiches to make a political statement about the fast-food chain's opposition to same-sex marriage, according to court documents.
Corkins also told investigators that he targeted the Family Research Council because it was listed as an anti-gay group on the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that monitors hate groups. The center has since removed the Family Research Council from its list of hate groups.
Corkins' attorney, David Bos, asked for a sentence of no more than 12 years in prison, saying his client suffers from Asperger's syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism. Bos said Corkins did not intend to kill anyone when he went to the Family Research Council's offices.

","By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 06:11 EST, 26 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:32 EST, 27 November 2013 . Hertz is being sued by one of its customers after he was allegedly racially abused by employees of the car rental firm on Facebook. Maurice Howard, 27, filed the complaint against the firm last week after staff at Hertz Rent-A-Car at Maui Airport, Hawaii, took to the social networking site to insult him in Pidgin English after he had hired a vehicle there. Mr Howard's attorney, Burton Gould, described the employee's comments as a 'hate crime' in a statement. Legal action: A 27-year-old man is suing car hire firm Hertz over allegations that members of staff racially abused him on Facebook (file picture) The group of employees allegedly took to Facebook in February 2012 to describe Mr Howard as a pretentious black man who rented impressive cars including BMWs. They mocked Mr Howard claiming that his credit card was often declined. The posts use terminology that Mr Howard's lawyers claim imply that he is a black man of low social status who aspires, in a crude manner, to appear to be of higher status. A post by another employee, Samantha Chun, reads: 'Run that faka over!!! lol.' Suing: Maurice Howard is also attempting to sue Facebook claiming that is violated its anti-bullying policy by allowing the posts which appeared in February 2012 . One of the members of staff named in the law suit, Shawn Akina, allegedly described Mr Howard as a 'broke ass faka who act like he get planny money'. Mr Howard is also taking legal action against . Facebook claiming that the site violated its policy banning content that . could be seen as bullying or causing emotional distress. His lawyer claims that his client's civil rights were violated and cites negligence on the part of both Hertz and Facebook for allowing the group to mock him. According to the Huffington Post, the Lawsuit says: 'Clearly the posting attacking and bullying Howard is a prima facie case of Facebook's own definition of ""harmful content"". 'Moreover, these same individuals, continue to have accounts on Facebook, despite Facebook's policies which explicitly state that such ""harmful content"" being posted on Facebook is grounds an individual's account be terminated.' The group of employees were all either fired or resigned following the incident, according to the lawsuit. The posts were reportedly deleted once Mr Howard was made aware of them. Hawaii Pidgin English is a form of Creole language based on English and used by many residents of Hawaii in everyday conversation. It was originally used as a form of communication between English speaking residents and non English speakers and is influenced by a range of languages including Portuguese and Cantonese. Hawaii's official languages are English and Hawaiian. Many natives of Hawaii, pictured, speak Hawaii pidgin in everyday life .","(546, 29)","Maurice Howard, a resident of Maui, Hawaii, has made some shocking allegations against the staff at a local Hertz car rental service. According to Howard, employees at the Maui Airport Hertz mocked him in a racist manner, describing him as a ""pretentious black man who rented high-performance cars."" Howard claims that he was referred to as a ""broke ass faka who act like he get planny money."" For those unfamiliar with local slang, this roughly translates to ""poor guy who acts like he has a lot of money."" The incident reportedly took place when Howard arrived at the Maui Airport Hertz to rent a vehicle. Howard, who is a successful businessman, says that he was dressed in casual clothing but had a designer handbag with him. According to Howard, the Hertz employees made fun of him for his appearance and accused him of trying to show off his wealth. ""It was a really humiliating experience,"" Howard told reporters. ""I couldn't believe that this was happening to me in 2021. It's just not acceptable."" Howard believes that he was targeted because of his race. He says that the employees he interacted with were all white and that he was the only black person in the rental office at the time. The incident has sparked outrage among members of the local community, with many calling for an investigation into Hertz's hiring and training practices. Some have also started a social media campaign using the hashtag #BoycottHertz, urging others to take their business elsewhere. Hertz has responded to the allegations, saying that they take the matter very seriously and are conducting an internal investigation. In a statement, the company said: ""Hertz does not tolerate any form of discrimination or racism in our workplace or in the services we provide. We are deeply concerned about the allegations made by Mr. Howard and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened."" This is not the first time that Hertz has faced criticism for its treatment of customers. In 2018, a customer in Florida sued the company for discrimination, claiming that she was kicked out of a rental office because she was wearing a hijab. As for Maurice Howard, he says that he hopes his story will encourage others to come forward if they have experienced similar discrimination. ""I think it's important for people to speak up when they've been mistreated,"" he said. ""That's the only way things will change.""

The mask, which is known to have been worn by the on-screen villain, has been used to implicate 19-year-old Fabian Kramer in the brutal killing of his elderly landlady. According to court documents, Kramer was sentenced to ten years in prison after pleading guilty to the murder. The teen was found to have stabbed his landlady a shocking 50 times, in what prosecutors described as ""pure murderous lust."" The victim, who was in her 70s, was found by a neighbor who came to check on her after noticing her front door was left open. In court, the prosecution argued that Kramer's obsession with the movie serial killer played a role in his decision to commit the murder. They presented the mask, which was recovered from Kramer's apartment, as evidence that the teen was deeply influenced by the character. ""The defendant chose to emulate a fictional killer, and as a result, a real person lost their life,"" the prosecutor said in his closing argument. Kramer's defense team argued that their client had a history of mental illness and should be treated as such. But the judge ultimately rejected this argument, citing the severity of the crime and the fact that Kramer had previously been convicted of assaulting a police officer. ""We don't want to see another tragedy like this,"" the judge said in handing down the sentence. ""The defendant needs to be held accountable for his actions and to take responsibility for his role in this senseless act of violence."" The use of the movie mask as evidence has raised some eyebrows among legal experts. While it is not uncommon for props or costumes to be used in trials, it is rare for a piece of fiction to be used in such a way. ""This is a really interesting case from a legal perspective,"" said law professor Jonathan Simon. ""It raises questions about how we distinguish reality from fiction, and what role fictional characters and stories play in shaping our behavior."" For the victim's family, the verdict brings a sense of closure, but also a reminder of the senseless violence that took their loved one's life. ""We are glad justice has been served, but it doesn't bring her back,"" said the victim's daughter in a statement. ""We hope this sends a message to others that violence is never the answer, no matter how much it may seem like it in the movies.""","(493, 19)","By. Allan Hall.

Mask of movie serial killer Hannibal Lecter used as exhibit in REAL-LIFE murder trial
Fabian Kramer, 19, has been sentenced to ten years in prison for the murder of his elderly landlady
Kramer stabbed her 50 times in an 'act of pure murderous lust'
A mask of the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lector was used as an exhibit in a real-life murder trial.
Fabian Kramer, now 19, was found guilty of stabbing his 72-year-old landlady to death in an act of 'pure murderous lust'.
He was sentenced to 10 years in prison after a court heard how he had stabbed her more than 50 times in the neck, chest and stomach.
The mask of the fictional character, played by Anthony Hopkins in the film Silence of the Lambs, was shown to the jury during the trial.
It was used as an example of the type of mask Kramer had been wearing when he attacked his victim.
Kramer, who was 17 at the time of the killing, had denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
He claimed he had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time.
But the court heard that he had made no attempt to call for help after the attack and had even tried to cover up his crime by setting fire to the victim's house.
Kramer had been living with the victim, named only as Mrs S, in her home in the town of Wuppertal, Germany, for several months before the attack.
The court heard that Kramer had become obsessed with the Hannibal Lecter character after watching the 1991 film starring Anthony Hopkins.
Prosecutors said Kramer had been wearing a mask similar to the one worn by Lecter in the film when he carried out the attack.
The mask was shown to the court during the trial.
The court also heard that Kramer had sent a text message to a friend shortly before the attack saying: 'I'm going to kill my landlady. I'm going to stab her to death.'
After the attack, Kramer set fire to Mrs S's house in an attempt to cover up the crime.
He then went to a local police station and told officers that he had been attacked by a group of men who had tied him up and forced him to set fire to the house.
Kramer was later arrested and charged with murder.
During the trial, the court heard evidence from a number of witnesses who had seen Kramer acting strangely in the days leading up to the attack.
One witness said he had seen Kramer walking around the town wearing a mask and carrying a knife.
Another witness said she had seen Kramer acting aggressively towards Mrs S in the days before the attack.
Kramer's defence team argued that he had been suffering from a mental illness at the time and was not responsible for his actions.
But the court rejected this argument and found Kramer guilty of murder.
Kramer will now serve a 10-year prison sentence.
The case has sparked outrage in Germany, with many people calling for the death penalty to be reintroduced in the country.
Some people have also called for the mask of Hannibal Lecter to be banned from being shown in public.
Others have argued that the case shows the need for better mental health services in Germany.
The case has also raised questions about the use of masks in films and other media.
Some people have argued that the use of masks can desensitise people to violence and make them more likely to commit acts of violence themselves.
However, others have argued that masks can be used to create a sense of fear and suspense, which can be beneficial in certain situations.
The case of Fabian Kramer is a tragic example of the dangers of mental illness and the need for better support for people who are struggling with their mental health.
It is also a reminder of the importance of being aware of the potential dangers of masks and other forms of media that may desensitise us to violence.

Your article is well-written and informative. However, there are a few areas where you could improve your writing.
Firstly, you could add more detail to your introduction. Currently, it is a bit vague and doesn't give the reader a clear idea of what the article is about.
Secondly, you could use more varied sentence structure. Your sentences are all quite short and simple, which can make the article feel a bit repetitive.
Finally, you could proofread your article more carefully. There are a few typos and grammatical errors that could be easily fixed.
Overall, your article is a good start, but with a bit more work, it could be even better.","(900, 45)","By . Allan Hall . PUBLISHED: . 06:10 EST, 8 November 2012 . | .
Fabian Kramer, 19, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for stabbing his landlady to death in ""pure murderous lust"".
Kramer, who was 17 at the time of the murder, was found guilty by a jury of second-degree murder on Friday.
The teen stabbed his landlady, 68, 50 times with a kitchen knife after she refused to give him money to buy drugs.
Kramer's defense attorney argued that his client suffered from a mental illness and was not responsible for his actions.
However, the jury rejected the defense's argument and found Kramer guilty.
He will be eligible for parole after serving 85 percent of his sentence, which is 8 years and 10 months.
The victim's daughter, who was in court for the verdict, said she was ""satisfied"" with the sentence.

""He's not going to be able to hurt anyone else.""
Kramer was also ordered to pay $1,000 in restitution to the victim's family.
He was also sentenced to five years of probation after he is released from prison.
He must also register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.","(251, 17)","By. Allan Hall. PUBLISHED:. 06:10 EST, 8 November 2012. |.

Fabian Kramer, 19, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for stabbing his landlady to death in ""pure murderous lust"".
Kramer, who was 17 at the time of the murder, was found guilty by a jury of second-degree murder on Friday.
The teen stabbed his landlady, 68, 50 times with a kitchen knife after she refused to give him money to buy drugs.
Kramer's defense attorney argued that his client suffered from a mental illness and was not responsible for his actions.
However, the jury rejected the defense's argument and found Kramer guilty.
He will be eligible for parole after serving 85 percent of his sentence, which is 8 years and 10 months.
The victim's daughter, who was in court for the verdict, said she was ""satisfied"" with the sentence.
She said: ""I'm glad he's going to be in jail for a long time.
""He's not going to be able to hurt anyone else.""
Kramer was also ordered to pay $1,000 in restitution to the victim's family.
He was also sentenced to five years of probation after he is released from prison.
He must also register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.","(760, 36)","(251, 17)"

","By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 1:12 PM on 30th December 2011 . An aggressive species of crayfish which has been invading England's waterways is being tracked with radio transmitters in a bid to understand why they move so quickly - and help control their advance. The American predators have colonised the River Lee near Enfield, moving at more than 500m per month. The crayfish have now taken over 17km of the river. The Environment Agency said virile crayfish, which are non-native, prey on native wildlife and spread crayfish plague, a disease deadly to native white-clawed crayfish. It is believed that virile crayfish arrived in the UK after an aquarium owner released them into an east London pond. The predatory North American crayfish are believed to have escaped an aquarium in East London before colonising a river. Now they are being fitted with radio transmitters . The Environment Agency has fitted small radio transmitters on the backs of the unwelcome guests, with preliminary results showing that virile crayfish are moving upstream at a rate of 500 metres (1,640ft) per month. This is substantially faster than their cousin, the signal crayfish, which is also non-native. The UK's only native crayfish, the white clawed crayfish, was wiped out along the River Lee following the invasion of the signal crayfish in the 1980s and the associated spread of crayfish plague. Adam Ellis, environmental monitoring officer at the Environment Agency, said: 'Whilst rivers in England and Wales are cleaner than they have been for decades, there is still a lot to be done in order to return them to full health. This includes the control of invasive species like virile crayfish.' I fought the claw and the claw won: Undated Environment Agency handout photo of Inger Jennings, Environmental Monitoring Officer with a virile (right) and signal crayfish (left) 'By tracking the colonisation of the River Lee by virile crayfish, we will better understand how this species impacts the environment and our native wildlife.' 'However, one of the most important ways to protect our wildlife is to stop the spread of non-native invasive species. We're appealing to the public not to release unwanted pets into the wild.' Anyone who catches a crayfish must follow strict guidelines on how to handle them in order to prevent their spread and the transmission of crayfish plague. The rise of invasive species is a major challenge in meeting tough new EU targets on the ecology of rivers and lakes. They cost the UK economy an estimated £1.7 billion every year, according to the Environment Agency.","(475, 21)","A river in Enfield, north London, is being taken over by American signal crayfish. These invasive species are moving at an alarming rate of 500 meters a month, and are causing devastation to the ecosystem of the Enfield waterway. These crayfish have been introduced to the UK in the 1970s but due to their aggressive nature they have out-competed native crayfish and decimated their population. Not only do they eat native wildlife, they also spread a lethal plague that can kill off other aquatic life. This lethal disease was first discovered at a waterway in Norfolk in 2014 and has been spreading across the UK ever since.  Experts suggest that the signal crayfish are devastating aquatic ecosystems across the country, causing a significant decline in biodiversity. They believe that these predators have an insatiable appetite, which means that they'll eat almost anything they encounter in the waterway. This includes native crayfish, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates, and even small mammals if they're hungry enough. This invasive species is not just causing problems for wildlife, it is also having an impact on the economy of Enfield. The crayfish are also causing damage to the river banks and are interfering with recreational activities such as fishing, boating, and swimming. Local authorities are working to control the population of signal crayfish in the area, but it’s an uphill battle. There is no simple solution to controlling the spread of signal crayfish. The best way to prevent them from spreading is to avoid releasing them into rivers in the first place. But unfortunately, many people continue to release signal crayfish into rivers as a means of controlling the populations of other invasive species such as zebra mussels. The Enfield council is taking action, advising locals to avoid introducing any foreign or invasive species into the local waterways. Additionally, they are creating reserves and safe havens for the native critters living in the river—all with the aim of ensuring that they are protected in their natural habitat. Despite the challenges, conservationist remain optimistic. There are signs of recovery in other parts of the world, where communities have worked together to eradicate and control the spread of these predators. With local authorities and the community working together, it's possible to protect the biodiversity of Enfield's waterways from further damage caused by the predatory nature of the invasive signal crayfish. Overall, the future of the region's natural inhabitants hangs in the balance, and everyone must work towards finding an effective solution to keep the environment safe and thriving.","(469, 20)","By.

Predatory American crayfish have taken over a river in Enfield, eating native wildlife and spreading lethal crayfish plague.
The crustaceans are moving at a rate of up to 500 meters per month along the River Lea, according to a study by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).
Crayfish plague is a fungal disease which can wipe out entire populations of native crayfish. It was brought to Europe from North America in the late 1800s, and has since wiped out native crayfish populations across the continent.
Native crayfish populations in the River Lea have already been decimated by the plague, and the American crayfish now pose a threat to other native species, including otters, water voles and birds such as kingfishers and herons.
The ZSL and CEH study found that the American crayfish were moving upstream at a rate of between 200 and 500 meters per year, and could reach the source of the River Lea within 20 years.
The study also found that the crayfish were having a significant impact on the ecology of the river, with native crayfish populations reduced by up to 90% in areas where the American crayfish had established themselves.
The researchers called for urgent action to be taken to control the spread of the American crayfish, including the use of traps and barriers to prevent them from moving upstream.
They also called for more research to be carried out into the impact of the crayfish on native species, and the development of new methods to control their spread.

","It seems this polar bear cub was desperate to be the centre of attention. Colin Mackenzie, 53, captured the adorable bear showing off its best dance moves for the camera while on a trip to Svalbard, Norway. The photographer, from south London, looked on with amazement as the bear threw its giant paws in the air and appeared to strike a series of poses for the camera. The polar bear cub appeared to be lapping up the attention as it performed some of its best moves for the camera . Photographer Colin Mackenzie managed to capture the unusual shots while touring the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard . Colin said the cub eventually followed its mother but not before completing its 'dance' and performing a grand finale with a stunning nosedive into the icy waters. He said: 'The polar bear cubs were following their mother on some ice but they were certainly full of energy and keen to expend it. 'They spent a good half hour exploring the area and were a team of mischief and energy. The cub was full of energy as it played with its sibling and stood on its hind legs before following its mother across the ice . The two bears were describe by Mr Mackenzie as 'a team of mischief and energy' as they bounded across the snow . The photographer captured the intimate moments on his second trip to the Norwegian archipelago, following a previous holiday in 2012 . The cub performed a grand finale by jumping into the icy waters before following its mother to move onwards . 'Eventually the mother moved on and slowly the cubs followed - after a little dancing and playing. 'It was just great to be in the right place at the right time and have great light to see and also photograph the cubs. 'If the weather had been foggy then it would have been a lot harder to even spot the bears let alone observe them. Even as they disappeared into the distance, the  cubs continued play fighting and leaping around . 'I have been carrying a camera around with me since I was a teenager and developed images in my darkroom before the wonderful digital cameras emerged. 'I enjoy wildlife photography because of the sheer challenge to find the wild animal rather than just go to a wildlife park. 'I initially photographed polar bears in 2012 so to go back this year and capture these images was an epic experience.'","(442, 19)","Svalbard, Norway - Wildlife photographer Colin Mackenzie has captured a stunning sequence of images featuring a polar bear cub and its siblings in Svalbard, Norway. The cub appeared to be dancing for the camera before tumbling with its siblings and jumping into the water. Mackenzie, who was leading a photography tour, said the cubs were a ""team of mischief and energy."" The images capture the playful nature of these creatures as they explore their surroundings. The polar bear cubs can be seen energetically wrestling with one another, rolling around in the snow and even appearing to dance for the camera. Polar bears are apex predators in the Arctic and are considered to be threatened, with their populations declining due to climate change and habitat loss. However, conservation groups have been working to protect these animals, with efforts focused on reducing carbon emissions and protecting their habitat. The stunning images captured by Colin Mackenzie are a testament to the beauty and importance of these animals. Mackenzie, who has been photographing wildlife for over 20 years, said the experience of photographing these cubs was unmatched. ""It was an incredible experience to observe these cubs up close and watch them play and interact with each other,"" he said. ""They were a team of mischief and energy, always exploring and pushing the boundaries of their environment. It was a joy to capture these images and share them with the world."" Mackenzie's images are a reminder of the importance of conservation efforts to protect the Arctic's fragile ecosystem. Climate change is having a severe impact on this region, with rising temperatures causing the Arctic sea ice to melt and food sources for polar bears becoming scarcer. But despite the challenges facing the polar bear population, the cubs captured in Mackenzie's breathtaking images are a sign of hope for the future. Through continued conservation efforts, we can ensure that these magnificent creatures continue to thrive in their natural habitats for generations to come. In conclusion, Mackenzie has showcased his exceptional photography skills by capturing the polar bear cubs in their natural habitat. These magnificent creatures continue to demand attention and protection amidst the climate change crisis. The images serve as a reminder of the importance of preserving and protecting our natural world.","(420, 19)","It seems this polar bear cub was desperate to be the centre of attention. Colin

","(CNN) -- South Korea on Wednesday announced sanctions against Iran -- including government scrutiny of most financial transactions involving the country -- as part of global efforts to quash Tehran's suspected nuclear program. A key Iranian bank also will face ""a heavy penalty,"" said South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Kim Young-sun, according to state media. The Seoul branch of Iran's Bank Mellat has allegedly facilitated hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions for Iranian nuclear, missile and defense agencies, the Yonhap news agency said. Korea also will expand a sanctions blacklist to limit the foreign-exchange transactions of more than 100 people and Iranian entities; step up inspections of suspicious cargo to and from Iran; put those blacklisted on a travel ban; and limit investments in Iran's gas and oil refinery industries. The blacklisted entities include Bank Mellat, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, according to Yonhap. The United States, a key South Korean ally, has lobbied other nations to step up sanctions against Iran. The European Union, Canada and Japan are among those that have done so. Iran is continuing its uranium enrichment activities in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to a report released Monday by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran has rebuffed international demands to halt its uranium enrichment program, saying it wants the nuclear fuel for peaceful uses. The IAEA is not convinced. In low concentrations, enriched uranium can be used to fuel civilian power plants, but in extremely high concentrations, it can be used to produce a nuclear bomb. ""Based on an overall analysis undertaken by the agency of all the information available to it, the agency remains concerned about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed nuclear-related activities involving military-related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile,"" the IAEA report said. Last month, the United States extended sanctions against Iran, saying it was targeting a number of Iranian businesses and groups accused of helping organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Taliban. In June, the United Nations imposed some of its toughest sanctions yet of Iran. The new sanctions include cargo inspections, new controls on Iranian banks, restrictions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a new U.N. panel of experts to help monitor and enforce sanctions, and asset freezes on 40 entities and individuals. Also in June, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions targeting the country's nuclear and missile programs, identifying more than 20 companies and several individuals allegedly involved with those programs.","(483, 16)","The United States is pushing for increased sanctions against Iran amidst concerns that the country may be enriching uranium to build a nuclear bomb. As part of its efforts, the U.S. is calling on other countries to join in its efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. One of the measures being proposed by the U.S. includes increased scrutiny of financial transactions involving Iran. This is meant to deny the Iranian government access to the funds needed to develop its nuclear program. In addition to financial scrutiny, the U.S. is also calling for increased cargo inspections to prevent the movement of materials that could be used to build nuclear weapons. Iran has consistently denied allegations that it is developing nuclear weapons, stating that its nuclear program is aimed solely at producing energy for its citizens. The country has defied U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for it to halt its uranium enrichment program, leading to increased tensions with the international community. Despite international pressure, Iran has continued to pursue its nuclear program, even as it faces economic sanctions from the United States and other countries. The U.S. has been lobbying other countries to join in its efforts to increase pressure on Iran, with some success. In response to the U.S. campaign, some countries have already taken steps to reduce their imports of Iranian oil and other goods. The European Union has also imposed a number of economic sanctions on Iran, including restrictions on access to its banking system. Iran has dismissed these efforts as being based on unfounded suspicions and biased information. It has instead called for a more equal and respectful dialogue with the international community to resolve the issue of its nuclear program. Despite the ongoing tensions between Iran and the U.S., some experts believe that a peaceful resolution to the situation is still possible. They argue that dialogue and diplomacy offer the best path forward, and that increasing sanctions and military threats will only serve to escalate the conflict. For now, however, it seems that the U.S. and other countries will continue to pursue increased sanctions and other measures to pressure Iran to abandon its nuclear program.

Amir Khan has become a dad for the first time after his wife gave birth
","Amir Khan has become a dad for the first time after his wife gave birth to a baby girl on Friday. The former WBA and IBF light-welterweight king, and his wife Faryal, have given their daughter the Arabic name of Lamysa, which means 'soft to the touch'. Khan, 27, announced the news on Twitter and later posted two photos of himself cradling Lamysa. All smiles: Boxer Amir Khan has become a dad for the first time, after his wife gave birth to a baby girl on Friday . He tweeted: 'Faryal and I are delighted to announce the birth our first child Lamysa Khan everyone doing very well, thank you for all your wishes.' A later tweet read: 'Mine and @FaryalxMakhdoom New born baby LAMYSA. Born on 23rd May 2014 at 4:05am £Blessed'.

Among those affected was Anne Felton, who was enjoying a meal at the fast-food restaurant when the incident occurred. According to reports, the incident was caused by a leaky gas line, which allowed gas to build up in the restaurant. Unfortunately, this led to 10 people falling ill, including Felton. The incident occurred at around dinner time, and there were approximately 30 people in the restaurant at the time. Witnesses reported a strong smell of gas, and many people began to feel sick. Emergency services were called to the scene, and the restaurant was immediately evacuated. Felton and the other affected individuals were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Fortunately, all of the individuals affected by the incident are expected to make a full recovery. However, the incident has raised questions about safety measures at the fast-food restaurant. The McDonald's location in Pooler has issued a statement regarding the incident, expressing their concern for those affected and confirming that they are conducting an investigation to determine what caused the gas leak. ""We are deeply concerned about the incident that occurred at our Pooler location last week,"" the statement read. ""We are working closely with authorities to determine the cause of the gas leak, and we are committed to taking all necessary measures to ensure that our customers and employees are safe."" The incident has also sparked conversations about the dangers of gas leaks and the importance of being aware of the warning signs. Experts recommend that individuals take steps to protect themselves by installing gas detectors in their homes and workplaces, and by being aware of the symptoms of gas poisoning, which can include headaches, nausea, dizziness, and confusion. For Anne Felton and the other nine individuals affected by the incident at McDonald's, the road to recovery is expected to be a lengthy one. However, with proper care and attention, they should all make a full recovery and be able to return to their daily lives.

","By . Ted Thornhill . A Spanish cyclist was saddled with acute embarrassment after he passionately celebrated winning a Tour of California stage – without realizing he had one lap to go. Eloy Teruel screamed and pumped his fists in the air as he crossed what he thought was the finishing line of the prestigious event’s penultimate seventh stage in Pasadena. But his unbridled joy quickly turned to humiliation as it became apparent that Saturday’s race wasn’t over. There was another lap of a 3.1mile (five kilometre) circuit left to pedal around. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Oops: Eloy Teruel mistakenly raises his arms, thinking he had won the seventh stage of the Tour of California in Pasadena on Saturday . However, the Spaniard saw the funny side, and tweeted: ‘I wanted to win, luckily no one has seen. Hahahahaha.’ He joins a long list of sports stars who've celebrated prematurely, which includes Alex Cujavante coasting towards the finishing line during the 2010 Roller Speed Skating Championships in Colombia with his arms raised in victory, only to be overtaken in the final few yards and Lindsey Jacobellis indulging in a victory 'tail-grab' in the 2006 Winter Olympics snowboard cross - only to fall over before the finishing line. The real winner: Peter Sagan, left, of Slovakia . Wheel-y fast: Bradley Wiggins (centre) was the overall winner of the Tour of California . Cheeky: Bradley Wiggins receives congratulatory kisses as the overall winner of the Tour of California . Overall victory of the event went to former Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins, with fellow Briton Mark Cavendish sprinting to the final-stage win. Wiggins came home in the front group at the end of the hilly 76.1-mile (121.7-kilometre) eighth stage to finish the race in Thousand Oaks 30 seconds ahead of Rohan Dennis (Garmin-Sharp) and claim his first win of the season. And he paid tribute to the team-mates who supported him over the three ascents of the Rock Store climb. Scenic: The peloton climbs the foothills of Mount Hamilton during stage three of the 2014 Tour of California from San Jose to Mount Diablo . Wiggins said on the Team Sky website: ‘I say it every day, but without those guys I wouldn't be in this position. 'You can't do it on your own and, as strong as my performance was individually in the time trial, my team have taken the strain all week. ‘Those young Americans in my team, Joe (Dombrowski), Ian (Boswell) and Danny (Pate) have done a fantastic job. Even today they didn't give up the chase and came back after they'd been distanced on the climbs. This is a fantastic way to finish.’","(514, 22)","In a stunning turn of events at Stage 7 of the Tour of California, Eloy Teruel of Spain prematurely celebrated his victory before the race was over. Teruel, who rides for the Movistar Team, thought he had successfully crossed the finish line and immediately pumped his arms in the air in triumph. However, to his dismay, there was actually one more lap to go on the course that he had not completed. Teruel was not the only rider caught off guard by the course's length as other cyclists also slowed down, thinking that the race was over. Teruel ultimately finished in 56th place, a significant drop from his momentary position as the frontrunner of the race. The actual winner of the Stage 7 event was Levi Leipheimer of the United States, who rode for the Astana team. Britain's Bradley Wiggins, however, clinched the overall victory of the Tour of California, securing his place in cycling history with a remarkable achievement. Wiggins, who had previously won the Tour de France in 2012, demonstrated once again his dominance in the sport of cycling. The Team Sky rider completed the grueling 720-mile course in just under 28 hours, winning by a comfortable margin of 30 seconds over runner-up Rohan Dennis of Australia, who rode for the Garmin-Sharp team. Wiggins' win in the Tour of California, which took place over eight days across diverse terrain throughout the state, solidifies his place as one of the most accomplished cyclists of his generation. He has won numerous prestigious titles throughout his career, including several Olympic gold medals, in addition to being one of the most recognizable figures in the sport. Despite the disappointment of Teruel's premature celebration, the Tour of California drew massive crowds and was an exciting celebration of cycling sport. From the steep mountain trails to the arid flats, cyclists from across the world tested their skills against challenging terrain and skilled opponents. The Tour of California has become an essential event on the cycling calendar, drawing talented riders from all over the world to compete in one of the sport's most demanding challenges. As the world of cycling continues to grow and evolve, events like the Tour of California will continue to showcase the best and brightest riders in the sport, as well as providing thrilling spectacles for fans both in person and around the world.","(437, 15)","By.

(CNN) -- Kenya's bar association is calling for the prosecution of men who publicly strip
","(CNN) -- Kenya's bar association is calling for the prosecution of men who publicly strip women because of the way they dress. ""The ongoing brutality that is stripping our women in public for allegedly dressing in an indecent manner must be brought to an end,"" Eric Mutua, chairman of the Law Society of Kenya, said in a statement. Mutua urged Keriako Tobiko, director of public prosecutions, to take action and for the national police to form a special unit to patrol areas where these crimes are likely to happen. ""These kinds of actions are not only illegal but immoral by all standards and should never be tolerated or condoned in a civilized society,"" Mutua said. In an recent incident, a group of men stripped a woman naked in Nairobi after accusing her of ""indecent"" dressing. The attack was captured on video and prompted outrage on social media under the hashtag #mydressmychoice. In footage posted on YouTube and shown on local television, attackers confronted the woman at a bus stop. The men pushed and shoved her, eventually stripping her naked. In the background, attackers yell ""Toa"" -- Swahili for ""take it off!"" -- as they tug at her clothes. Kenyans took to the streets of Nairobi on November 17 to protest the attacks. Protesters marched through the capital's downtown carrying placards that read ""My dress, my choice,"" while others donned miniskirts, the same attire the unidentified woman wore when she was attacked. Some men wore dresses to show their support. More iReport photos: #MyDressMyChoice . It is not the first time a woman has been undressed for purported indecent dressing in the East African nation, which is a majority Christian. After the videotaped incident, other instances of women getting undressed were reported, including in Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city. The issue in not limited to Kenya. Over the years, there have been similar occurrences elsewhere in Africa, including Malawi, Cameroon and Zimbabwe. Kenyan authorities have said they are investigating the incidents. CNN's Daisy Carrington and Rachel Rodriguez contributed to this report.","(399, 20)","The chairman of a local Kenyan human rights organization has spoken out against a recent incident that has caused outrage both in Kenya and around the world. In a statement, the chairman condemned the actions of a group of men who were caught on video stripping a woman in Nairobi. ""These kinds of actions are not only illegal but immoral by all standards,"" the chairman said. ""We condemn this act and call for the perpetrators to be brought to justice."" The video, which was posted on social media earlier this month, shows a group of men surrounding a woman and forcibly removing her clothes. The attack has sparked outrage in Kenya, where many have taken to social media using the hashtag #mydressmychoice to express their solidarity with the victim and to call for an end to violence against women. The incident has also brought attention to the issue of sexual harassment and gender-based violence in Kenya. According to recent data, more than one in three women in the country has experienced some form of sexual or physical abuse. In response to the attack, several organizations and activists have called for increased efforts to combat gender-based violence in Kenya. Many have also called for the government to take action to ensure that women are protected from such attacks. ""We need to see stronger measures in place to prevent and respond to gender-based violence,"" said one activist. ""This kind of behavior is simply unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue."" The incident has also raised concerns about the role of social media in reporting and responding to incidents of violence. While many have praised the use of social media in raising awareness of the attack, some have also expressed concern about the potential for further harm to victims. ""We need to be careful about how we use social media in these cases,"" said one commentator. ""While it can be a powerful tool for raising awareness and encouraging action, we also need to ensure that we protect the privacy and safety of victims."" As the investigation into the attack continues, many are hoping that the perpetrators will be brought to justice and that the incident will serve as a reminder of the urgent need to address the issue of gender-based violence in Kenya.","(423, 17)","(CNN) -- Kenya's bar association is calling for the prosecution of men who publicly strip
and humiliate women, after a video of men doing just that went viral on social media.
The video, which has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Twitter, shows a group of men
stripping a woman in broad daylight in Nairobi, Kenya's capital. In the video, one of the
men can be heard saying, ""This is what you get when you dress like a prostitute.""
The bar association's chairman, Nelson Havi, said in a statement that the men's actions were
""not only illegal but also immoral by all standards.""
Havi called on the Kenyan government to investigate the incident and bring the perpetrators
to justice. He also urged the public to report any similar incidents to the authorities.
The incident has sparked outrage on social media, with many Kenyans using the hashtag
#MyDressMyChoice to express their anger and frustration. Some have called for the men to be
arrested and prosecuted, while others have demanded that the government do more to protect
women from such attacks.
The Kenyan government has yet to comment on the incident. However, President Uhuru Kenyatta
has previously spoken out against gender-based violence, saying that it has no place in
Kenya. He has also launched a campaign to raise awareness about the issue and to encourage
men to take a stand against it.
The incident is just the latest in a series of high-profile cases of gender-based violence
in Kenya. Last year, a man was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a seven-year-old
girl. And in 2018, a woman was killed by her husband after she refused to have sex with him.
Gender-based violence is a serious problem in Kenya and around the world. According to the
World Health Organization, one in three women worldwide has experienced physical or sexual
violence in her lifetime. In Kenya, the situation is even worse, with one in two women
reporting having experienced some form of gender-based violence.
There are many factors that contribute to gender-based violence, including poverty, lack of
education, and traditional gender roles. However, one of the most important factors is
gender inequality. When women are not treated as equal to men, they are more likely to be
victims of violence. This is why it is so important for governments and societies to work
together to promote gender equality and to protect women from violence.
The incident in Nairobi is a reminder that gender-based violence is still a serious problem
in Kenya. It is also a reminder that we all have a role to play in ending it. We can start
by speaking out against it and by supporting organizations that work to protect women from
violence. We can also demand that our governments do more to address the root causes of

","By . Adam Shergold . PUBLISHED: . 11:42 EST, 18 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:42 EST, 18 November 2012 . Henry was meant to be a miniature pony - but he was getting bigger and bigger by the minute. The owners of the two-foot tall pony just couldn't figure out why he had become so bad-tempered, until they noticed his stomach was all bloated. It wasn't the result of eating too much hay, however, that was causing the problem, but Henry's strange habit of swallowing sand. Snacking on sand: Henry the 2ft high Shetland pony became ill after grazing on sand in an all-weather paddock . He had been left to exercise in an outdoor all-weather paddock and, it seemed, had taken to the taste of its grainy covering. Unfortunately, his new meal had blocked his large intestine and this was having an effect on his other organs. His owners and other horse-lovers rallied round to quickly raise £6,000 for life-saving treatment and Henry is now making a full recovery. Owner Caroline Howarth, from Coppull near Chorley, Lancashire, bought Henry when he was six months old for her eight-year-old daughter Madison. Escape artist: Henry, seen here with her eight-year-old owner Madison, needed emergency surgery to flush out the build-up of sand . 'As soon as I saw him I knew we had to have him,' Mrs Howarth said. 'But after a while we noticed his tummy was getting bigger and bigger. Day-in, day-out it just kept swelling. 'I thought he might need worming and I kept a firm control on his food intake. 'It did not stop and the vets took a blood sample which said his liver wasn't working properly. 'They gave him more tests and my horse insurance level of £1,000 ran out. 'We had to fund any future treatment ourselves.' Happy again: The miniature pony is now making a full recovery after the emergency treatment, which was paid for by local horse lovers . Fellow horse lovers at the Seven Stars Stables at Standish, where Henry lives, decided to raise money for treatment by going on a sponsored walk. Henry was taken to the Equine Hospital at the Leahurst Campus of the University of Liverpool, which specialises in rare illnesses and serious injuries to horses. Vets there decided to flush Henry's stomach and found a build up of sand was causing all the problems. They carried out surgery to save his life and placed him on a special diet as he recovers back to health. Mrs Howarth added: 'He is a cheeky little horse and at the horse hospital they had to put a notice on his stable saying he was an escape artist. 'He now has a special diet - but no sand!'","(515, 30)","In a heartwarming story of hope and determination, a tiny Shetland pony named Henry has made a full recovery after undergoing a £6,000 emergency operation. The pony, who lives in Lancashire, had been suffering from bad temper and an increasingly swollen stomach. Thankfully, a team of vets were able to diagnose the problem: Henry had swallowed a load of sand while grazing on an all-weather paddock, which had become lodged in his large intestine. The blockage was causing the pony significant discomfort and endangering his health. Despite the high cost of the operation, a group of horse lovers rallied together to raise the necessary funds. Their love and devotion to the animal proved to be a powerful force, as they were able to generate the money needed to save Henry's life. Following the operation, Henry has made a complete recovery and is now back to his old self. The pony's owner, Emma Robinson, shared her pride in the horse-loving community, stating that the support they received was overwhelming. “We just can't thank everyone enough,” Robinson said. “We're overwhelmed by the support we've had from people who we never knew before this happened. The love and devotion they have for Henry has just been incredible.” For Emma Robinson and her family, Henry is much more than just a horse – he is a beloved family member. The fact that so many people were willing to come together to help him during his time of need is a testament to the power of community and the love that people have for animals. The operation was carried out by experienced vets who cared for the pony throughout his recovery. They praised the community for their unwavering support and emphasised how life-changing this operation has been for Henry. “Henry's operation was very complex and required a lot of skill.” Said one of the vets. “We were determined to save him, and with the help of the local community, we were able to do just that. We're thrilled that Henry has made such a full recovery.” For Henry, life is once again filled with joy and playfulness. The pony's bad temper and swollen stomach are now just distant memories. The love and care of his community, combined with the skills of dedicated veterinary professionals, saved Henry's life and restored him to his former self. This story is a shining example of the power of human kindness and the special bond between animals and their caretakers.","(466, 20)","By. Adam Shergold. PUBLISHED:. 11:42 EST, 18 November 2012. |.

This is a very good response. You have included all of the key details from the highlights, and you have used them in the correct order. You have also included some extra information about the pony, which is good.
However, there are a few things that you could improve. First, you could add some more detail about the pony’s condition before the operation. For example, you could say that he was lethargic and had stopped eating. This would give the reader a better understanding of how serious the situation was.
Second, you could use a more formal tone in your writing. For example, instead of saying “horse lovers”, you could say “equine enthusiasts”. This would make your writing sound more professional.
Finally, you could check your spelling and grammar. There are a few mistakes in your response, which could be confusing for the reader.
Overall, this is a good response, but there is room for improvement. If you can make these changes, your response will be even better.","(328, 24)","By . Adam Shergold . PUBLISHED: . 11:42 EST, 18 November 2012 . | .

The leader of a U.S. Army small-kill team has been charged with two counts of murder for allegedly killing two deaf, unarmed Iraqi boys in a small Iraqi village in March of 2007. Former Staff Sergeant Michael Barbera has been charged by military prosecutors in the fatal shootings of  Ahmad Khalid al-Timmimi, 15, and his brother Abbas, 14, as the boys were tending cattle in a palm grove just outside As Sadah, about 50 miles northeast of Baghdad. Additionally, the 31-year-old Barbera 'lying to his commanders, directing fellow soldiers to lie to military . investigators and making a threatening phone call to a civilian in an . effort to keep what happened from becoming public,' according to a report from the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Killer: Authorities say Sergeant Michael Barbera fatally shot two unarmed, deaf Iraqi boys in 2007 . Barbera led Charlie Troop, 5th Squadron of the 73rd Airborne Reconnaissance Regiment out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. At the time of the alleged murders, the squadron was involved in counterinsurgency operations in the Diyala province. That's when military officials say Barbera fatally shot the two boys before lying to his superiors about how they died. 'None of us feel good about this. But I'm glad that the Army is . doing the right thing,' Ken Katter, 46, of Saginaw, Mich., the . sniper assigned to Barbera's team, told the paper. 'Leader': Barbera led a small-kill team in the Army's 73rd Airborne Reconnaissance Regiment when the alleged murders took place . Katter is one of several soldiers who brought the killings to the attention of Army officials. Katter firmly believes that the shootings led to two truck bomb attacks two weeks later that killed 10 soldiers. According to the Trib, investigators who reviewed the case recommended that Barbera be charged with two counts of murder. However, those charges never made it to an Article 32 hearing. Instead, the paper reports, Barbera received a light reprimand and ultimately promoted. However, whistle-blowers like Katter and others spoke up against their former superior officer. 'All we ever asked was for someone to listen to us and give what we were concerned about — a fair hearing,' Katter said. Barbera was charged on Wednesday at Alaska's Fort Richardson with two counts of murder. He currently is in the process of being moved to Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, where he will undergo a formal arraignment.","(484, 30)","An ex-Marine from California, who was working as a contractor in Iraq, has been charged in the murder of two young boys, who were tending cattle in a grove. Sergeant Michael Barbera was indicted on two counts of murder, two counts of obstruction of justice, and two counts of making false statements to the authorities, according to a statement released Monday on the website of the US Department of Justice. The incident took place in March 2007, when Barbera was working as a private security contractor for a US firm operating in Iraq. According to court documents, Barbera allegedly shot and killed the two boys, aged 16 and 11, while they were working in a palm grove, about 150 miles north of Baghdad. He then reportedly covered up the killings by lying to his superiors. The indictment alleges that Barbera falsely claimed that he fired in self-defense after being attacked by a group of armed men. He also allegedly tried to dispose of evidence by hiding the murder weapons and fabricating evidence to support his story. The boys' families have called for justice, saying that they have waited for years to find out what really happened to their loved ones. ""We've been waiting for justice, and now we're finally getting it,"" said one family member. Barbera, who is now 35 years old, faces up to life in prison if convicted of the murder charges. The case highlights the issue of private security contractors operating in war zones. These contractors have been accused of killing civilians and committing other abuses, sometimes with impunity. In recent years, there have been calls for greater oversight and accountability for private contractors, particularly in war zones. The US government has been criticized for the use of private contractors, who have been accused of committing human rights abuses and other crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the US has taken steps to improve oversight of these contractors, abuses continue to occur. The case is being prosecuted by the US Department of Justice's National Security Division, with assistance from the FBI and the US Army Criminal Investigation Command. A trial date has not yet been set.","(404, 17)","By. Daily Mail Reporters. PUBLISHED:. 17:30 EST, 16 November 2013. |
Sergeant Michael Barbera has been charged with two counts of second-degree murder in connection with the fatal shooting of two teenage boys who were tending cattle in a Palm Grove. The incident took place on November 15th, 2013, when Sergeant Barbera allegedly shot and killed the two boys while they were grazing their cattle in a remote area of Palm Grove. According to authorities, Sergeant Barbera then attempted to cover up the crime by lying to his superiors about what had happened. This article will provide a detailed account of the events leading up to the shooting, as well as the subsequent investigation and charges brought against Sergeant Barbera.
On November 15th, 2013, Sergeant Michael Barbera was on patrol in Palm Grove when he came across two teenage boys, identified as John Doe and Jane Doe, who were tending their cattle in a nearby field. According to witnesses, Sergeant Barbera approached the boys and asked them what they were doing in the area. The boys reportedly told Sergeant Barbera that they were simply tending their cattle and had no intention of causing any trouble. However, Sergeant Barbera allegedly became agitated and demanded that the boys leave the area immediately. When the boys refused to comply, Sergeant Barbera pulled out his service weapon and fired several shots at them, killing both boys instantly.
After the shooting, Sergeant Barbera reportedly attempted to cover up his actions by telling his superiors that the boys had attacked him and that he had been forced to shoot them in self-defense. However, witnesses who were present at the scene of the shooting contradicted Sergeant Barbera’s version of events, stating that the boys had done nothing to provoke Sergeant Barbera and that he had shot them without warning. As a result of the conflicting accounts, an investigation was launched into the incident, and Sergeant Barbera was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
During the course of the investigation, it was discovered that Sergeant Barbera had a history of violent behavior and had previously been reprimanded for using excessive force while on duty. Additionally, it was revealed that Sergeant Barbera was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of his experiences in the military, which may have contributed to his aggressive behavior on the day of the shooting.
Based on the evidence gathered during the investigation, Sergeant Barbera was charged with two count s of second-degree murder. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. In addition to the criminal charges, Sergeant Barbera is also facing disciplinary action from the Palm Grove Police Department, which could result in his termination from the force.
The shooting of the two teenage boys in Palm Grove has sparked outrage among the local community, with many calling for Sergeant Barbera to be held accountable for his actions. The incident has also raised concerns about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers and the need for better training and support for officers who may be suffering from PTSD or other mental health issues.
As the investigation into the shooting continues, it remains to be seen whether Sergeant Barbera will be found guilty of the charges brought against him. However, it is clear that this tragic incident has had a profound impact on the community of Palm Grove and has highlighted the need for greater accountability and transparency in law enforcement.","(637, 25)","By .

New York (CNN) -- A New York judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed by
","New York (CNN) -- A New York judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed by a group of atheists, ruling that a pair of World Trade Center beams in the shape of a cross can be included in a memorial museum of the 9/11 terror attacks. American Atheists filed the lawsuit in July, arguing that the ""government enshrinement of the cross"" was an impermissible mingling of church and state. The World Trade Center cross, two intersecting steel beams that held up when the twin towers collapsed on September 11, 2001, is seen as iconic to some. In 2011: Cross moved to permanent 9/11 Memorial site . The cross was moved in July from near a church to its new home at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, located at ground zero in Lower Manhattan. Father Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest who ministered to workers clearing the area after the attacks, led a ceremonial blessing of the cross. Federal Judge Deborah Batts of the Southern District of New York ruled Thursday that display of the beams is permissible because they bear historical importance. Note lets family know 9/11 victim went down fighting . Named defendants included the museum, New Jersey, the city of New York, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. ""The museum is gratified by the decision,"" Mark Alcott, the lawyer for the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, told CNN on Friday. ""The plan has been to display this as one of hundreds and hundreds of artifacts ... because it is part of the history of the recovery efforts after the 911 attacks. ""For some of these people, [the cross] had symbolic significance,"" he continued, referring to first responders. ""They treated it as a religious object and it gave them a great deal of comfort at a difficult time. The 9/11 museum is simply depicting what happened."" David Silverman, president of American Atheists, told CNN, ""We are angry that we have to have this fight."" Silverman said it was clear that the cross was regarded as sacred, noting that it ""was installed in a religious service on consecrated ground by a priest. How anyone could say that is secular is beyond me."" September 11 ""affected all Americans, not just Christians,"" Silverman continued. ""We will not sit and let the 500 atheists who died on 9/11 go unnoticed."" Silverman said his group plans to appeal the decision. ""We are confident that we will eventually win this case and that cross will be removed, or atheists will be allowed to have our own symbol in there,"" he said. Memorial tourism bears witness to tragedy .","(505, 23)","In a recent court decision, a judge has thrown out a lawsuit brought by an atheist group challenging the inclusion of two intersecting steel beams in the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. The beams are considered iconic symbols of the World Trade Center's resilience and are on display at the museum.  The group, known as American Atheists, argued that the presence of the beams, which were recovered from the wreckage of the Twin Towers after the 9/11 attacks, amounted to a government endorsement of religion. They claimed that the beams, which resembled a cross, represented the Christian faith and violated the separation of church and state.  However, the judge ruled that the museum's display of the beams is permissible because they have historical significance and represent an important artifact from one of the most significant events in American history. The judge stated that the beams depict a moment of resilience and hope, rather than a religious symbol.  The president of American Atheists, David Silverman, expressed his disappointment in the ruling but highlighted that the case had a broader significance beyond the museum. He emphasized that the case was about equality and the need to ensure that all Americans, regardless of their religious beliefs, are treated equally.  ""9/11 affected all Americans, not just Christians,"" said Silverman. He added that the group plans to continue their efforts to ensure that the government remains neutral on issues of religion and that all Americans receive fair and equal treatment.  The inclusion of religious symbols in public places has been a controversial issue in the United States for many years. Many religious groups argue that such symbols are a part of the country's heritage and should be allowed in public spaces, while others argue that including such symbols violates the principle of separation of church and state.  In the past, the Supreme Court has held that the government cannot endorse or promote a particular religion. However, the inclusion of religious symbols in public spaces is often a matter of interpretation and has been the subject of intense debate in recent years.  Ultimately, the judge's decision to allow the display of the intersecting steel beams in the 9/11 museum represents a victory for those who believe that such symbols have historical significance and reflect important moments in American history. It also highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the role of religion in public life and the need to ensure that all Americans receive equal treatment under the law.","(454, 16)","New York (CNN) -- A New York judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed by
an atheist group challenging the inclusion of two intersecting steel
beams from the World Trade Center in the National September 11
Memorial and Museum.
U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken dismissed the lawsuit filed by the
American Atheists, which argued that the inclusion of the so-called
""Survivor Stairs"" in the museum violated the First Amendment's
separation of church and state.
Oetken wrote in his decision that the beams have ""historical
importance"" and that their inclusion in the museum does not violate
the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the
establishment of religion by the government.
""Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the
merits of their Establishment Clause claim,"" Oetken wrote. ""The
Survivor Stairs' inclusion in the Museum does not violate the
Establishment Clause because the Survivor Stairs have historical
importance, and the Museum's display of the Survivor Stairs is
permissible because it is secular in purpose and effect.""
The lawsuit was filed last year by David Silverman, president of the
New Jersey-based American Atheists, who said the inclusion of the
beams in the museum amounted to a government endorsement of religion.
Silverman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on
Oetken's ruling.
The beams, which are known as the ""Survivor Stairs,"" were discovered
in the rubble of the World Trade Center after the September 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks. They became a symbol of hope for rescue workers
because they were one of the few pieces of the building that remained
intact after the collapse of the twin towers.
The beams have been treated as an iconic symbol of the September 11
attacks and have been displayed in several locations, including the
National September 11 Memorial and Museum in New York City and the
National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial in Washington, D.C.
The lawsuit was filed against the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center site, and the National
September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center Foundation,
which operates the museum.
In his ruling, Oetken noted that the beams have been displayed in
several locations around the country, including the National 9/11
Pentagon Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National
Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
Oetken also noted that the beams had been displayed at the National
Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, before they
were moved to the World Trade Center memorial site in New York City.
""The fact that the Survivor Stairs were previously displayed at the
National Museum of the U.S. Air Force demonstrates that the Survivor
Stairs have historical importance and are not inherently religious,""
Oetken wrote.
The judge also noted that the museum's display of the beams is
secular in purpose and effect, and that the beams are not being
displayed in a religious context.
""The Survivor Stairs are not being displayed in a religious context;
rather, they are being displayed in a secular context as part of the
museum's exhibit on the events of September 11th, 2001,"" Oetken
wrote. ""The Survivor Stairs' display in the Museum is secular in
purpose and effect, and therefore does not violate the Establishment
Clause.""
Oetken also rejected the atheist group's argument that the inclusion
of the beams in the museum violates the principle of separation of
church and state.
""The Establishment Clause does not prohibit all government
endorsement of religion; rather, it prohibits the government from
endorsing a particular religion or religion in general over non-
religion,"" he wrote. ""Here, there is no evidence that the government

He added: 'I apologise to the audience because I couldn’t even explain at that time.' Asked if he could explain now, he said: 'Not yet, maybe one day I will.' Polunin, who has performed in Russia since April, said: 'In Russia it’s great because you can concentrate 100 per cent on your work. There are not as many distractions as London or in the West.' Schaufuss said he was 'delighted' Polunin was coming back to the London stage and described him as a great dancer. 'Bad boy': The 23-year-old dancer is seen in action on stage in a Royal Ballet production of Sleeping Beauty in 2011 . Asked if the pair had made up, Polunin said he was not 'friends' with Schaufuss, but said they had a professional relationship. He said: 'I always respect Peter as a dancer and as a director, we’ve never made friends, but I still respect him. 'I think it’s important for professionals to do work even if you don’t become friends.' Asked about his reputation as the bad boy of ballet, Polunin said: 'It’s not being bad, it’s just trying to find yourself.'","(429, 21)","Sergei Polunin, the Ukrainian ballet dancer, has once again sparked controversy by walking out on rehearsals for a production ahead of its London premiere in April. The 23-year-old dancer, who has previously quit the famed Royal Ballet unexpectedly, apologised for his actions but refused to elaborate on the reasons that led to his departure. According to insiders, Polunin has cited unspecified ""health issues"" but did not offer any further details. Polunin, who was once touted as the future of ballet, has gained a reputation for his erratic behaviour and controversial statements. Last year, he announced his departure from the Royal Ballet in a shock move that made headlines around the world. In a subsequent interview, he spoke candidly about his disillusionment with the world of ballet and his desire to explore other forms of artistic expression. Despite his troubled past, Polunin remains a highly sought-after talent, commanding top fees for his performances. He has also received critical acclaim for his work in a number of productions, drawing praise for his technical skill and emotive performances. News of Polunin's departure from the upcoming production has caused consternation among fans and industry insiders alike, who are concerned about the impact of his absence on the show. In a statement, the production company acknowledged the disruption caused by Polunin's departure but expressed confidence in the remaining cast members to deliver a stellar performance. Despite the controversy surrounding Polunin, his talent and charisma have earned him a loyal following, with fans around the world eagerly anticipating his next move. While the reasons for his latest departure remain shrouded in mystery, there is no doubt that the enigmatic dancer will continue to captivate and confound audiences for years to come. In conclusion, Polunin's actions have caused concern and disappointment among his fans and the dance community at large. While his talent is undeniable, his tendency towards erratic behaviour has raised questions about his future in the industry. Only time will tell if Polunin will find his way back to the stage or if he will choose to pursue other forms of artistic expression.","(387, 15)","By. Kerry Mcdermott.

Sergei Polunin walks out on production ahead of London premiere
Ukrainian dance sensation Sergei Polunin has walked out on a new production just days before its London premiere.
The 23-year-old, who shot to fame when he unexpectedly quit the Royal Ballet last year, was due to star in a new production of Swan Lake at the London Coliseum next week.
But he has now pulled out of the show, citing a 'health issue', according to a statement from the English National Opera (ENO), which is staging the production.
Polunin said: 'It is with great regret that I have had to withdraw from the ENO's production of Swan Lake.
'I have been suffering from a health issue for the past few weeks and my doctor has advised me not to perform until I am fully recovered.
'I apologise to all those who have been looking forward to seeing me in this production. I look forward to returning to the stage as soon as possible.'
A spokesman for the ENO said: 'We are very disappointed that Sergei Polunin will not be able to perform in our production of Swan Lake next week.
'We wish him a speedy recovery and look forward to working with him again in the future.'
Polunin made headlines around the world when he walked out on the Royal Ballet in April 2012, just months after being promoted to principal dancer.
He later apologised for his actions, but refused to elaborate on the 'health issue' that forced him to pull out of Swan Lake.
Polunin was born in Ukraine in 1989 and trained at the Kyiv State Choreographic School.
He joined the Royal Ballet in 2002 and was promoted to first soloist in 2007 and principal dancer in 2010.
He left the company in 2012 to pursue a career as a freelance dancer and choreographer.
Polunin has worked with some of the world's leading ballet companies, including the Bolshoi Ballet, the Paris Opera Ballet and the New York City Ballet.
He has also appeared in a number of films and television programmes, including the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing and ITV's Dancing on Ice.
Polunin's decision to walk out on Swan Lake is a blow to the ENO, which has been struggling financially in recent years.
The company has been forced to cancel a number of productions in the past few years due to lack of funding.
Swan Lake is one of the most popular ballets in the world and has been performed by some of the greatest dancers of all time, including Rudolf Nureyev, Margot Fonteyn and Mikhail Baryshnikov.
The ENO's production, which was due to open on June 4, is directed by Wayne McGregor and choreographed by Liam Scarlett.
It features a cast of more than 100 dancers, including Polunin's former Royal Ballet colleague Alina Cojocaru.
Cojocaru said: 'I am very sorry to hear that Sergei will not be performing in Swan Lake.
'He is a wonderful dancer and I am sure he will be back on stage as soon as he is feeling better.'
Polunin's withdrawal from Swan Lake is the latest in a series of setbacks for the ENO.
Last year, the company was forced to cancel its production of Tosca due to a lack of funding.
And earlier this year, it was announced that the ENO would be merging with the Royal Opera House to create a new national opera company.
The merger, which is due to take place in 2015, is seen as a way of securing the future of both companies.
But it has also been criticised by some, who argue that it will lead to a reduction in the number of performances and a decrease in the quality of the productions.
The ENO has denied that the merger will have any impact on the quality of its productions.
A spokesman said: 'The ENO is committed to producing high-quality opera and ballet.
'We are confident that the merger will not affect the quality of our productions and we look forward to continuing to bring world-class opera and ballet to audiences across the UK.'","(772, 36)","By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 11:21 EST, 28 May 2013 . | .

Jose Mourinho is to contest his FA misconduct charge when he makes a formal submission
","Jose Mourinho is to contest his FA misconduct charge when he makes a formal submission to the governing body before Tuesday’s 6pm deadline. The Chelsea manager was charged after claiming there is a ‘campaign’ against the Barclays Premier League leaders when they were denied a penalty in the 1-1 draw at Southampton on December 28. Mourinho, who has generally toned down his comments since his return to English football, has the full support of the club in his case. Jose Mourinho was charged by the FA for saying that there was a campaign against Chelsea . Mourinho (right) talks to his support staff after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving against Southampton . The Chelsea manager can make representations to the FA disciplinary commission by way of mitigation, but it appears he is most likely to highlight his concerns by requesting a personal hearing. It is understood Mourinho will put together video evidence to support his claim that match officials are failing to award his team key decisions in matches. Mourinho lost control at St Mary’s when referee Anthony Taylor booked Cesc Fabregas for simulation when the Spaniard appeared to be fouled by Southampton defender Matt Targett. At the time he said: ‘There is a campaign against Chelsea. I don't know why there is this campaign and I do not care. Everybody knows it was a penalty.’ Cesc Fabregas is shocked after being denied a penalty and is instead booked for simulation . Fabregas appears to be brought down by Southampton's Matt Targett during the match at St Mary's . Since the charge he has taken a vow of silence and refused to speak with the media ahead of Saturday’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle United at Stamford Bridge. The Chelsea chief sent his assistant coach Steve Holland instead, and it was his deputy who again spoke to the media after the win over John Carver’s Magpies side. An FA statement released last week said: ‘It is alleged his remarks constitute improper conduct in that they allege and/or imply bias on the part of a referee or referees and/or bring the game into disrepute.’ Mourinho has already been issued with a formal warning following his demand for a ‘strong referee’ ahead of Chelsea's 2-0 win at Stoke City on December 22. Chelsea beat Newcastle United 2-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday but Mourinho did not face the media . Assistant manager Steve Holland stepped in for Mourinho at Chelsea's press conference on Friday .","(453, 17)","Last week, Jose Mourinho, the manager of Chelsea FC, was given a misconduct charge by the Football Association (FA). This comes after he claimed that there was a ""campaign"" being carried out against his team. Mourinho's charges stem from his post-match comments following Chelsea's 1-3 loss against Southampton on Saturday, October 3rd. During the game, Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas was shown a yellow card for simulation after he was brought down inside the penalty box. Mourinho claimed that it was a clear penalty and that his team was not getting the same calls that other Premier League teams were receiving. He further suggested that there was a ""campaign"" being carried out to tarnish Chelsea's reputation. The FA has charged Mourinho with misconduct under Rule E3(1) for his post-match comments. He was given until 6 pm on Tuesday, October 13th, to formally respond to the charges. It is expected that Mourinho will use video evidence to support his claims. This is not the first time that Mourinho has landed in trouble with the FA. In the 2014-15 season, he was charged with misconduct on two separate occasions, which led to him being banned from the touchline for the FA Cup quarter-final tie against Bradford City. Chelsea is currently enduring a difficult start to the 2015-16 season. The defending champions have won only two of their first eight Premier League matches, leaving them in 16th place in the table. There have been rumors of a rift between Mourinho and some of his players, which has resulted in some poor performances on the pitch. Chelsea fans will be hoping that the situation improves soon, as they look to defend their Premier League title. In the meantime, Mourinho will be focusing on preparing for Chelsea's upcoming matches, while also responding to the FA charges. This is a developing story, and we will bring you updates as they come in. Stay tuned to our website for more Chelsea news, including analysis of Mourinho's response to the charges, his team's performance on the pitch, and the ongoing rumors of a dressing room rift.","(398, 18)","Jose Mourinho is to contest his FA misconduct charge when he makes a formal submission

","By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:42 AM on 13th July 2011 . An historic London house inhabited by squatters was completely trashed last night after violence erupted at a 'closing party' advertised on Facebook. Police were forced to step in this morning after hundreds of people descended on the squat in Brixton, south London, following a council announcement that inhabitants of the property would be evicted today. There were reports of muggings and vandalism at the party at Clifton Mansions, a block of 22 council-owned flats on Coldharbour Lane. A man dives at police this morning as they arrive to evict squatters in the building in Brixton, south London . Hundreds of revellers last night turned up to a party at Clifton Mansions on Coldharbour Lane, which was finally brought to a close at 9am this morning when police stepped in to evict residents . The flats once housed alternative musicians and artists, such as members of Irish punk-folk band The Pogues and Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller. The council notified residents of the building, which has been squatted for over a decade, of this morning's eviction several weeks ago, claiming they were cracking down on 'anti-social behaviour'. In anticipation of the eviction, residents held an 'eviction party', with more than 1,000 people signing up for the event on Facebook. Twitter user 'smileandsubvert' tweeted: 'Brixton's longest squats turned into teenage Facebook party, vandalism, theft and finally eviction this morning.' In other tweets he said: '2 Polish . guys who lived there got pinned down & had their bikes and laptops . stolen' and '2 guys pulled all the copper piping off the walls.' The council notified residents of the squat of this morning's eviction several weeks ago, claiming they were cracking down on 'anti-social behaviour' Council-owned block Clifton Mansions, which once housed members of Irish punk-folk band The Pogues and Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller, has now been vacated . Police also said they were notified of a robbery at the address at 3.50am. A 17-year-old boy from Beckenham had his mobile phone stolen by two suspects. 'BrixtonBuzz' tweeted party-goers who heard about the event via Facebook had 'trashed what should have been a celebration of an old Brixton squat'. The party was finally brought to a close at 9am this morning when police stepped in to evict residents. A police spokesman said: 'The pre-planned eviction of Clifton Mansions went ahead with minimal pockets of resistance and the premises have now been vacated and handed back over to the Local Authority. 'During this incident a police officer received an injury to his eye and has been taken to a south London hospital. A 35 year-old man had been arrested for assault on police.' The council now plans to sell off the property, and will be employing 'live-in guardians' to safeguard the property until a buyer is found.","(534, 24)","Residents of a building that once housed members of the legendary Irish band, The Pogues, were shaken up after a terrifying incident last night. One inhabitant reported being pinned down and mugged by thieves who ripped copper piping from the walls of the flats. The iconic building, located in the heart of Dublin, has long been a mecca for music fans and history buffs alike. Known as ""The Pogues' flat,"" the building was home to the band's lead singer, Shane MacGowan, and other members in the early days of their career. Despite the building's storied past, it seems that it has not been immune to the rising tide of crime that has swept through Dublin in recent years. Last night's incident, which saw thieves rip copper piping from the walls of the flats, was just the latest in a string of similar crimes that have plagued the area. According to eyewitnesses, the thieves were brazen and efficient, quickly making off with the valuable copper piping before anyone could stop them. The incident has left residents feeling vulnerable and anxious, with many calling for increased security measures to be put in place. For some, the incident was especially jarring, given the historical significance of the building. One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""It's just devastating to see something like this happen to a place that means so much to so many people. This was the home of The Pogues, for crying out loud. It's like a piece of history has been desecrated."" Others were more concerned about the safety of the residents themselves. One inhabitant, who was home at the time of the incident, described the terror of being pinned down and mugged by the thieves. ""I heard a noise outside and when I went to investigate, these guys just came at me out of nowhere. They held me down and took my wallet and phone. It was absolutely terrifying."" The incident has prompted calls for increased security measures in the building, with some suggesting that security cameras and alarm systems be installed to better protect residents. There is also a growing sense of concern about the wider issue of crime in Dublin, with many residents feeling that more needs to be done to address the problem. For now, residents of ""The Pogues' flat"" are left to pick up the pieces and try to move on from this traumatic event.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new generation of deep-sea submarines light enough to launch from
","LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new generation of deep-sea submarines light enough to launch from a yacht could open up the ocean's depths to amateur explorers. The planned ""Deep Flight II"" -- shown here in an artist's impression -- should be able to dive to 37,000 ft. The ""Deep Flight"" winged submersibles are experimental prototypes designed to dive to depths of up to 37,000 ft -- almost four times as deep as a giant squid dives -- descending at 400 ft/minute. They are the brainchild of submarine designer Graham Hawkes who is in the process of building commercial models that can reach those depths. Hawkes has been designing submarines since the 1960s, working initially with the British Special Forces and then for the oil industry. He now sells his designs to wealthy sailboat owners as the ultimate yacht accessory. ""If you have the money for a mega-yacht and you're just limited to the surface, then what a waste. That's my perspective,"" Hawkes told CNN in a telephone interview. The late billionaire balloonist and adventurer, Steve Fossett, commissioned one of Hawkes' experimental prototypes, ""Deep Flight Challenger,"" which can dive to 37,000 ft. The craft was four weeks away from delivery when he died. Venture capitalist Tom Perkins has ordered one of Hawkes' first commercially-available models, ""Deep Flight Superfalcon"" for his yacht ""Maltese Falcon."" The $1.5 million sub is capable of diving to 1,000 ft and comes complete with air conditioning. While price means these craft are out of reach for most leisure users, Hawkes denies they are simply rich men's toys. ""The thing is a space ship, I don't like the term toy,"" said Hawkes of the subs which his company is also positioning as a cheaper alternative to research craft for science, industry and exploration. ""'Superfalcon' has a capability greater than the U.S. Navy. ""I personally very much like the idea of empowering individuals to explore."" Unlike conventional subs which get heavy and sink, Hawkes' designs are positively buoyant and have to power down into the depths: ""It's like an airplane in reverse."" They have life support good for 24 hours in the depths and a range of 10-20 miles. They are also quick and highly maneuverable. Hawkes, who describes himself as claustrophobic, says diving deep in one of his subs is an ""awe inspiring experience."" ""We just finished flight testing 'Superfalcon. It goes down vertical and you pull one gee when you make a turn,"" he said. Paul Willis contributed to this report.","(492, 23)","A new deep-sea sub called the Deep Flight II has been designed to be able to dive to the depths of 37,000 feet. The brainchild of designer Graham Hawkes, the new sub is also light enough to be launched from a yacht, making it the perfect tool for those who want to explore the deepest parts of the sea. According to Hawkes, he is in the process of producing the first Deep Flight II craft, which has yet to be priced. However, the current sub that he has produced, called the Superfalcon, costs $1.5 million. While that might seem like a lot of money for a sub, Hawkes claims that the Superfalcon has a capability greater than that of the U.S. Navy. The Deep Flight II sub uses a revolutionary design that allows it to move through water with very little resistance. This is important when diving to such great depths, as the water pressure can be extreme. The sub is also equipped with advanced technology that allows it to function in such extreme conditions. It is able to withstand the intense pressure and still provide a comfortable environment for those inside. Launching the sub from a yacht is also an important feature. It makes it possible for anyone who can afford to own a yacht to be able to explore the depths of the sea. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for those who are interested in deep-sea exploration. While the Deep Flight II sub is still in the process of being produced, it has already generated a lot of interest among those who are interested in deep-sea exploration. The ability to dive to 37,000 feet is a feat that has never been achieved before, and the fact that the sub is light enough to be launched from a yacht is an added bonus. The sub is expected to be available for purchase in the near future, though no official release date has been announced. For those who are interested in owning one, it is likely to be quite expensive. However, for those who are serious about deep-sea exploration, the price will be worth it to be able to explore the depths of the sea like never before. In conclusion, the Deep Flight II sub is a game-changer for deep-sea exploration. With its ability to dive to 37,000 feet and its lightweight design that allows it to be launched from a yacht, it opens up a whole new world of possibilities for those who are interested in exploring the depths of the sea. While it might be expensive, it is likely to be worth it for those who are serious about deep-sea exploration.","(486, 20)","LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new generation of deep-sea submarines light enough to launch from
yachts is being developed by a British designer.
Graham Hawkes, who has been designing deep-sea submersibles for more than 30 years, is in the
process of producing the first of a new breed of submersibles that can dive to depths of 37,000
feet (11,300 meters).
Hawkes' company, Hawkes Ocean Technologies (HOT), has already produced the Superfalcon, a
submersible capable of diving to 20,000 feet (6,100 meters). The Superfalcon, which costs about
$1.5 million, is currently being used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) in the United States.
Hawkes told CNN that the Superfalcon had a capability greater than that of the United States
Navy's Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV), which can dive to a depth of 18,000 feet (5,500
meters).
The Superfalcon was launched in 2003 and has since been used by NOAA to explore shipwrecks off
the coasts of Florida and Hawaii.
Hawkes said he was now working on the Deep Flight II, which will be able to dive to depths of
37,000 feet. The Deep Flight II will be lighter than the Superfalcon and will be able to be
launched from a yacht.
The Deep Flight II is expected to be ready for launch in 2010.
Hawkes, who is based in San Francisco, California, said he was inspired to design deep-sea
submersibles after watching Jacques Cousteau's television program ""The Undersea World of
Jacques Cousteau"" as a child.
He said he had always been fascinated by the idea of exploring the deep sea and wanted to
develop a submersible that could take people to the deepest parts of the ocean.
Hawkes' submersibles have been used for a variety of purposes, including scientific research,
exploration, and film-making.
One of the most famous uses of a Hawkes submersible was in the 1997 film ""Titanic,"" where it was
used to film the wreck of the RMS Titanic on the ocean floor.
Hawkes has also designed submersibles for use in the oil and gas industry, where they are used
to inspect pipelines and other underwater infrastructure.
Hawkes believes that his submersibles have the potential to revolutionize the way we explore and
understand the deep sea.
He said that the Deep Flight II would be able to take people to places in the ocean that have
never been seen before, and that it would open up new opportunities for scientific research and
environmental monitoring.
Hawkes also believes that the submersibles could be used for tourism, allowing people to
experience the wonders of the deep sea without having to go through the rigors of traditional
deep-sea diving.
Hawkes Ocean Technologies is currently working on a number of other projects, including the
development of a new type of submersible that can fly underwater.
The company is also working on a project to develop a new type of propulsion system for
submersibles, which would allow them to travel faster and farther than ever before.
Hawkes is confident that his company will continue to innovate and push the boundaries of what is
possible in the world of deep-sea exploration.
He said that he was excited about the future of his company and the potential for his submersibles
to change the way we see and understand the deep sea.

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A judge has ordered the children of the Rev. Martin Luther
","ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- A judge has ordered the children of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to meet in their capacity as the sole shareholders of the corporation that manages their iconic father's estate. Dexter King has denied taking ""substantial funds"" from his parents' estates. King's children were in Fulton County, Georgia, Superior Court Monday in a dispute over their parents' estates. Two children of the civil rights icon are suing their brother, accusing him of wrongfully taking money from their parents' estates. The Rev. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III allege Dexter King took ""substantial funds"" out of Coretta Scott King's estate and ""wrongfully appropriated"" money from their father's estate. Dexter King has publicly denied the accusations. It was unclear what outcome having a shareholder meeting for the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr., Inc. would have on the dispute. The three siblings have not held such a meeting since 2004, corporation attorney Luke Lantta said. The removal of Dexter King as the estate's administrator is unlikely because that would require a meeting of the board of directors. Judge Ural Glanville on Monday also ruled in favor of dismissing some of the allegations against Dexter King, but left the question of whether he failed to act in the best interest of his father's incorporated estate to a jury. A trial on the allegation of breach of fiduciary duty could happen as early as next month. The lawsuit reveals a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity, particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King were in the courtroom Monday, but Dexter King was not. He had been injured in an accident in California and did not make the trip to Georgia. Dexter King had filed a counter claim against his sister, asking the court to force her to hand over to the corporation some items that belonged to Martin Luther King Jr. In a special hearing Monday, the court ruled that the items, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s Nobel Peace Prize and his love letters to Coretta Scott King will be turned over to the court to hold until a resolution is reached. The courtroom was packed with supporters of the King family. Among those in attendance were the Rev. Joseph Lowery and former Ambassador Andrew Young, friends of Martin Luther King Jr. who worked with him during the civil rights movement. CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","(471, 22)","Atlanta, Georgia - The King family is once again embroiled in a legal battle as two of Martin Luther King Jr.'s children, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III, have accused their brother, Dexter King, of taking money from the estates of their late parents. However, Dexter has strongly denied such claims. The dispute, which is playing out in a Georgia court, centers around the estates of Coretta Scott King and her husband, the world-renowned civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Dexter, who is the executor of the estates, has been accused of mismanaging funds and making unauthorized payments to himself. Bernice and Martin Luther King III have claimed that their brother has not been transparent about the details of his management of the estates. They allege that he has violated the trust agreements and fiduciary duties that were established to ensure that funds were properly managed and distributed according to their parents' wishes. The allegations have caused tension within the King family and even resulted in a courthouse showdown, with civil rights icons like Andrew Young and Jesse Jackson turning up in support of the sibling accusers. In contrast, Dexter King attended the legal hearing with his wife, Leah Weber King. The family dispute reportedly arose from a 2007 settlement agreement in which the siblings agreed to allow Dexter to serve as the executor of the estates, in exchange for a share of the profits earned from the estates. Mostly, they agreed to have their mother's archives preserved at Morehouse College. The current dispute, however, centers around what the siblings believe to be an abuse of that trust. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III are seeking to have their brother removed as executor and replaced with an independent trustee to ensure the estates are properly managed. Dexter King, however, strongly defended his actions, stating that his management of the estates has always been legal and above board. He claims that his siblings are simply trying to oust him for personal gain. ""Dexter believes that these claims are frivolous and are without merit,"" said William Hill Jr, Dexter's lawyer. The legal battle between the King siblings is ongoing, and the case is expected to drag on for some time. Meanwhile, the civil rights icons who have rallied around the family have called for a peaceful resolution to the dispute so that the King legacy can continue to inspire future generations.","(449, 16)","ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A judge has ordered the children of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. to appear in court next month to settle a dispute over the late civil rights
leader's estate.
Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney issued the order Tuesday after hearing arguments
from attorneys for Dexter Scott King and Martin Luther King III, who have accused their
sister, Bernice King, of misappropriating funds from their father's estate.
McBurney said he will hold a hearing on the matter on November 18.
Bernice King, who is the chief executive officer of the King Center for Nonviolent
Social Change, has denied the allegations.
The dispute centers on the sale of a house in Atlanta that was once owned by Martin
Luther King Jr. and his wife, Coretta Scott King, who died in 2006.
The house was sold in 2006 for $1.4 million, and the proceeds were placed in a trust
for the benefit of the couple's four children, according to court documents.
Dexter King, who is chairman of the board of the King Center, and Martin Luther King
III, who is president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, have accused
Bernice King of misappropriating some of the proceeds from the sale of the house.
They have also accused her of mismanaging the King Center, which was founded by their
parents in 1968.
Bernice King has denied the allegations and has accused her brothers of trying to
undermine her leadership of the King Center.
She has also accused them of trying to gain control of the King Center's assets.
The dispute has been ongoing for several years and has been the subject of numerous
court battles.
In 2017, a judge ruled that Bernice King had the authority to sell the house and that
the proceeds from the sale should be placed in a trust for the benefit of the King
children.
However, Dexter King and Martin Luther Kings III appealed the ruling, arguing that
Bernice King did not have the authority to make the sale without their consent.
In 2019, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling, finding that
Bernice king had the authority to act on behalf of the King children.
However, the court also found that the King children had the right to challenge the
sale of the house if they believed it was not in their best interests.
The dispute between the King children has raised questions about the future of the
King Center and the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.
Some critics have accused the King children of squabbling over their father's estate,
while others have defended them, saying they are simply trying to protect their
father's legacy.
Whatever the outcome of the dispute, it is clear that the King children will continue
to be involved in the management of the King Center and the promotion of their
father's message of nonviolence and social justice.","(536, 19)","ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A judge has ordered the children of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. to pay more than $100,000 in legal fees to the estate of the civil rights
activist's third wife.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney
ordered Bernice King and her brother, Martin Luther III, to pay the estate of Coretta
Scott King nearly $110,000 in attorney's fees.
Bernice King and Martin Luther III are the children of Coretta Scott King, who died in

The newspaper reported that McBurney's ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by
Coretta Scott King's estate, which accused Bernice and Martin Luther King of wrongfully
taking money from the estates of their mother and father.
The lawsuit alleged that Bernice King took money from the estate of her father, Martin
Luther King Jr., who died in 1968, and that Martin Luther III took money from his
mother's estate.
The estate of Martin Luther King Jr. is controlled by the King Center in Atlanta, which
was founded by the civil rights leader's widow, Coretta King.

King Jr. to appear in court next month to settle a dispute over the late civil rights
leader's estate.
Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney issued the order Tuesday after hearing arguments
from attorneys for Dexter Scott King and Martin Luther King III, who have accused their
sister, Bernice King, of misappropriating funds from their father's estate.
McBurney said he will hold a hearing on the matter on November 18.
Bernice King, who is the chief executive officer of the King Center for Nonviolent
Social Change, has denied the allegations.
The dispute centers on the sale of a house in Atlanta that was once owned by Martin
Luther King Jr. and his wife, Coretta Scott King, who died in 2006.
The house was sold in 2006 for $1.4 million, and the proceeds were placed in a trust
for the benefit of the couple's four children, according to court documents.
Dexter King, who is chairman of the board of the King Center, and Martin Luther King
III, who is president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, have accused
Bernice King of misappropriating some of the proceeds from the sale of the house.
They have also accused her of mismanaging the King Center, which was founded by their
parents in 1968.
Bernice King has denied the allegations and has accused her brothers of trying to
undermine her leadership of the King Center.
She has also accused them of trying to gain control of the King Center's assets.
The dispute has been ongoing for several years and has been the subject of numerous
court battles.
In 2017, a judge ruled that Bernice King had the authority to sell the house and that
the proceeds from the sale should be placed in a trust for the benefit of the King
children.
However, Dexter King and Martin Luther Kings III appealed the ruling, arguing that
Bernice King did not have the authority to make the sale without their consent.
In 2019, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling, finding that
Bernice king had the authority to act on behalf of the King children.
However, the court also found that the King children had the right to challenge the
sale of the house if they believed it was not in their best interests.
The dispute between the King children has raised questions about the future of the
King Center and the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.
Some critics have accused the King children of squabbling over their father's estate,
while others have defended them, saying they are simply trying to protect their
father's legacy.
Whatever the outcome of the dispute, it is clear that the King children will continue
to be involved in the management of the King Center and the promotion of their
father's message of nonviolence and social justice.","ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A judge has ordered the children of the Rev. Martin Luther

ordered Bernice King and her brother, Martin Luther III, to pay the estate of Coretta

","By . Daniel Mills . The family of a Queensland woman who died during her work Christmas party will not receive a payout for her death because she was ruled to be off-duty when the accident happened. Jukes Campbell was celebrating the function with colleagues when she dove into a shallow section of the Noosa River, suffering neck and back injuries. Despite the party being sanctioned by her boss and organised by the Woolworths-owned store, her death won't be recognised as a workplace accident. Jonathon Campbell, the woman's husband, turned her life support off two days after the party. Jonathon Campbell lost his a bid for his wife's workers compensation after the Queensland IRC ruled she did not die from duties performed at work. The Courier Mail reported that the Industrial Relations Commission, who sided with a Woolworths bid to block the family's claim for compensation, ruled that her husband Mr Campbell was not entitled to a payout from his wife’s death because she had been 'on a frolic of her own'. In order to qualify for a workers compensation payout staff must prove their injury 'arose out of, or in the course of' their work. The IRC ruled that Mrs Campbell was not working, proving a cruel blow for her husband who had originally won a Queensland Government workers compensation claim after the deputy director-general for Fair and Safe Work Queensland approved it. Woolworths said its staff encouraged Ms Campbell to attend the party which was celebrated in March instead of December because of staff commitments, but denied they encouraged her to dive into the Noosa River. It is claimed Ms Campbell asked her manager to take photos of her just before the accident occurred. Mrs Campbell dove head first into the Noosa River, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast during a Christmas work party in March . The Noosaville Dan Murphy's Store where Mrs Campbell worked . Woolworths has refused to comment on the matter because Mr Campbell has lodged an appeal and the case is still ongoing. The maximum amount payable for a workers compensation payout in Queensland is $374,625. Woolworths is one of Australia's largest retailers employing more than 197,000 people nationwide. It has nearly 900 retail liquor outlets and 627 petrol stations. In a similar case in NSW, Woolworths refused to pay workers compensation to the three orphaned children of single mother Marie Scanlan, the manager of a petrol station in western Sydney. Ms Scanlan suffered a  heart attack while driving to a stressful management meeting in April four years ago. The Workers Compensation Commission ordered Woolworths to pay $433,650 to Ms Scanlan’s children because her stressful job, where she worked up to 70 hours a week, aggravated her deadly heart condition.","(501, 21)","A Sunshine Coast mother has tragically passed away after an incident at a Christmas party organized by her employer, Woolworths. Jukes Campbell dived into a shallow section of the Noosa River, which resulted in severe injuries to her neck and back. Despite being taken to the hospital, she succumbed to her injuries. The incident has since taken a turn in the legal system as her husband, Jonathon Campbell, filed for workplace compensation from Woolworths. Initially approved, the appeal process overturned the decision after the Industrial Relations Commission found that Woolworths was not responsible for her injuries. The reason given was that the accident occurred while Jukes was off duty. Mr. Campbell has appealed this decision and is seeking justice for his late wife, but Woolworths has refused to comment on the matter. The death of Jukes Campbell has left her family and loved ones devastated. A community member, who wished to remain anonymous, spoke to local reporters and expressed their sadness over the situation. ""Jukes was such a kind-hearted woman. It's so unfair that she was taken away from us so soon. My heart goes out to her family, especially her husband, in this difficult time,"" they said. The incident has also sparked a conversation about employee safety, both on and off-duty. Many people are questioning whether employers should be held responsible for incidents that occur outside of work but during work-related events. According to the Queensland Work Health and Safety Act 2011, it is an employer's responsibility to ensure the safety of their employees in the workplace. However, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a workplace outside of work hours or off-site events. As the legal proceedings continue, many people are eagerly waiting to see what the outcome will be. Regardless of the final decision, the tragedy of Jukes Campbell's death is a reminder that safety should always be a top priority in the workplace and beyond. In conclusion, the death of Jukes Campbell at a Christmas party organized by her employer, Woolworths, has left her family and community devastated. Her husband's appeal for workplace compensation was overturned on the grounds that the accident occurred while Jukes was off duty. As the legal battle continues, this incident has sparked a conversation about employee safety beyond the borders of the workplace. Regardless of the outcome, it serves as a reminder to always prioritize safety and ensure the well-being of employees both on and off the clock.","(458, 22)","By. Daniel Mills.

It is important for people to be aware of the risks associated with
diving into shallow water, and to take precautions to ensure their
safety.
For example, people should always check the depth of the water before
diving in, and should avoid diving into water that is too shallow or
too deep.

","(CNN) -- A 50-year-old California woman reported missing more than a week ago -- having last told her teenage daughter she was heading to a nearby drugstore -- was found dead, police said. The Oakland Police Department said Tuesday in an e-mail that the Alameda County coroner's office has identified the remains of a woman found Friday in Solano County, which is between Sacramento and San Francisco, as those of Sandra Coke. Coke, who worked as an investigator in the Federal Public Defender's Office in Sacramento, was reported missing by her family on August 4. ""She was a loving mother, daughter, sister and auntie, and a shining light in our family; her good cheer, easy laugh and generous hugs will be missed,"" her family said Tuesday in a statement. ""Those of us who were privileged to know Sandra will remember her as an unusually kind, generous and big-hearted person."" Reports on a Facebook site tied to the family noted that Coke had gone to an Oakland drugstore intending to meet someone she thought had information about her missing dog. Her 15-year-old daughter called Coke's longtime friend, Wendy Springer, hours later when her mother hadn't returned home. Her car -- a 2007 Mini Cooper convertible -- was found in a parking lot the next day. ""She would never have left her daughter for more than 15 minutes and not checked in,"" Springer told reporters Thursday. That day, family members announced a $100,000 reward for information that would lead to Coke. They also spearheaded efforts to canvass the northern California city that she called home. According to Oakland police, Coke had been in good mental and physical health with no history of being reported missing. News of her death spurred an outpouring of condolences, including from Democratic campaign strategist Christine Pelosi and Natasha Minsker, a local ACLU leader who tweeted that Coke ""will be missed by many."" The grief was palpable in the statement from Coke's family, who hailed her impact professionally and personally on many people. ""She passionately devoted her professional life to helping the poor and those who endured difficult childhoods,"" the family said. ""All of us will miss Sandra's beautiful, giving spirit."" CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","(431, 17)","The missing person case of Sandra Coke, a 50-year-old resident of Oakland, California, has come to a tragic end after her remains were found in Solano County last week. Coke was reported missing on August 4 by her family, after she left home to go to a drugstore and never returned. The search for Coke was extensive, involving local police and volunteers. The community rallied around the family, posting flyers and sharing information on social media. However, the search efforts were unsuccessful for several months until last week when Solano County authorities discovered her remains. The Coke family released a statement expressing their grief and sadness over the loss of Sandra. They described her as ""a shining light in our family,"" and remembered her as a kind, loving, and caring person who always put her family and friends first. The Oakland Police Department is investigating the case as a homicide and has identified a suspect in the case. Randy Alana, a convicted felon, has been arrested and charged with Coke's murder. According to police, Alana had a history of criminal activity, including robbery and assault. Alana and Coke reportedly met sometime in 2012 or 2013 after Alana's release from prison, where he had served a sentence for a previous conviction. Coke worked as an investigator for the Office of the Federal Public Defender and had been providing assistance to Alana in his legal case. The motive for Coke's murder is not yet clear, but investigators believe that Alana was the last person to see her alive. They have also found evidence linking Alana to the disposal of Coke's body. The tragic end to Sandra Coke's story has left her family and friends heartbroken. Her death has also been a stark reminder of the dangers that people can face when helping others, particularly those who have a history of criminal activity.

(CNN) -- Officials in Costa Rica worked Friday to mop up the damage after heavy
","(CNN) -- Officials in Costa Rica worked Friday to mop up the damage after heavy rain and mud slides buried homes and killed at least 23 people in the Central American country, authorities said. Crews have found at least 20 people who were buried alive Thursday after pounding rains sent mud rushing over at least five homes in San Antonio de Escazu, a suburb of the nation's capital, the Costa Rica National Commission for Emergencies said. Several people were still reported missing there Friday, while three people were found dead in San Marcos de Tarrazu, a city in the central part of the country, said CNE. Another 2,639 people have sought refuge in 46 shelters, the commission said. President Laura Chinchilla has declared a state of emergency and said that Friday and Saturday would be national days of mourning. She visited an affected area in San Antonio de Escazu Friday to offer her support to the families missing loved ones. Images airing on CNN affiliate Teletica showed rescue crews digging through demolished homes. In another scene, workers at a mud-covered overturned vehicle spread a white sheet over a victim's body. Other images showed buckled roads damaged by the ferocity of the rushing water. In another area, some residents strung up a rope between two banks so people could hold on to it and walk across rushing water. Mud slides and flooding were reported in many places in the Central Valley area, which is surrounded by a handful of mountains and volcanoes. It is the most populous part of the nation. Classes were indefinitely canceled at many of Costa Rica's public schools, the education minister said on Teletica. About 800,000 people were left without safe water supplies, and residents were told to boil any water to be used for drinking or cooking.","(332, 14)","In the aftermath of the heavy rainfall and flooding that has been affecting San Marcos de Tarrazu, three more people were found dead on Wednesday. This brings the total number of fatalities to six, with several others still missing. The flooding has also heavily impacted the infrastructure in the region. Numerous homes have been demolished, and roads have been washed away, making transportation difficult. As a result, the government has set up 46 shelters across the region, which have provided refuge for thousands of affected citizens. The government has called for a state of emergency in the region and has deployed emergency personnel to provide aid and assistance to those affected. Rescue operations are ongoing, with search parties combing the flooded areas for survivors and those still missing. The flooding in San Marcos de Tarrazu is a result of heavy rainfall that caused rivers to overflow and lead to flash floods, landslides, and mudslides. The flooding has also led to extensive damage to some of the crops in the region, which might lead to food shortages in the coming days. Authorities are urging the citizens of San Marcos de Tarrazu to follow safety protocols and stay in shelters or safe locations until the situation improves. The government has also set up a hotline for citizens to report any incidents or request assistance. This is not the first time that San Marcos de Tarrazu has experienced flooding. In 2018, floods and landslides caused by heavy rainfall also led to numerous deaths and significant property damage. The government is now working to clean up the affected regions and restore essential services, including road networks and utilities. Citizens are urged to stay vigilant and keep themselves and their families safe as the region recovers from this natural disaster.","(322, 15)","(CNN) -- Officials in Costa Rica worked Friday to mop up the damage after heavy

This is a good start, but there are a few things you can do to improve it.
First, try to use more specific language. For example, instead of saying ""heavy
rains,"" you could say ""torrential downpours."" This will make your writing more
vivid and engaging.
Second, try to vary your sentence structure. Right now, your sentences are all
very similar in length and structure. This can make your writing feel monotonous
and boring. Try to mix up your sentence lengths and structures to keep your
reader engaged.
Finally, try to incorporate some of the key highlights from the prompt into your
writing. For example, you could mention that the heavy rains have caused
significant damage to infrastructure, or that the government is working to
mitigate the impact of the rains.
If you can incorporate these suggestions into your writing, you'll be well on
your way to writing a great news article!","(560, 27)","(CNN) -- Officials in Costa Rica worked Friday to mop up the damage after heavy

(CNN) -- Ahead of the 31st anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
","(CNN) -- Ahead of the 31st anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said his country will show its support to the revolution on February 11. ""Our revolution has changed the patterns and the equations of the world,"" he said in a nationally televised interview. Ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the Ten Days of Dawn, which lead up to the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. He said that enemies who plotted against Iran during the election protests last year continue to plot, but despite all the economic sanctions on the country, they are not succeeding. ""This year, they have mobilized themselves again to harm the Iranian nation and to stop them, but they failed,"" he said, adding that the capitalist powers who are against Iran have peaked. Specifically, he cited the United States and United Kingdom as nations that have tried to interfere with Iran's domestic issues. ""They adopted their stances, and they failed,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""This is a clear defeat for them."" On the nuclear issue, Ahmadinejad said that Iran seeks such production for peaceful purposes only. The United States and other nations have expressed concern that Iran wants to acquire nuclear weapons. The same countries who doubt Iran could, instead, partner with Iran and build the nuclear plants themselves if they wanted, he said. ""Russia, France and the United States can come and sign contracts to build the power plants. It serves our interests as well as theirs. Of course, if they don't come to do this, we will reach a point [where we will] build our own power plant,"" he said. The Iranian leader also mentioned the three American hikers who have been detained, saying that negotiations are ongoing. ""We don't like anyone in jail or in prison, but these people have violated our borders, and it has a defined penalty,"" he said, adding that there are Iranians ""languishing within American jails."" He hinted at a possible prisoner swap. ""We are approaching this from a humanitarian perspective and see how it goes,"" Ahmadinejad said. U.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said the United States is prepared to answer any questions about Iranians in U.S. custody. ""It's hard to know what he meant from these fragmentary comments, but we have made clear that we want consular access to our citizens in Iranian custody,"" Duguid said. ""If President Ahmadinejad's comments suggest that they are prepared to grant us access through the Swiss and resolve the cases of the three hikers and others in custody, we would welcome that step. It is long overdue."" CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","(516, 23)","As Iran prepares to mark the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution on February 11, tensions with the United States and United Kingdom are on the rise. In a nationally televised interview on Tuesday, Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad accused the two countries of trying to interfere in Iran's affairs. Ahmadinejad's comments came amid ongoing negotiations for the release of three American hikers who have been detained in Iran since July 31. The hikers, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal, and Sarah Shourd, were arrested for allegedly crossing into Iran illegally while hiking in a mountainous area near the Iraqi border. Despite repeated appeals from the United States for their release, the Iranian government has refused to free the hikers, citing ongoing investigations into their case. Ahmadinejad, however, suggested in his interview that the hikers could be released soon. ""We have ongoing negotiations, and I think these issues will be resolved,"" he said. The Iranian leader also accused the United States and United Kingdom of trying to meddle in Iran's affairs. ""They want to interfere in the affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, but they will not be able to achieve their goals,"" he said. Ahmadinejad's remarks were likely aimed at the United States and United Kingdom's recent efforts to apply pressure on the Iranian government. Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions against Iran's ballistic missile program, while the U.K. froze the assets of an Iranian bank accused of funding terrorism. The tension between the two sides is unlikely to abate anytime soon, with both the U.S. and U.K. continuing to take a hardline stance on Iran. In a recent speech, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Iran that it would face ""consequences"" if it failed to meet its international obligations, while British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the U.K. would not hesitate to take action against the Iranian government if necessary. Despite the tough talk from both sides, there is hope that the upcoming anniversary of the Islamic Revolution could provide an opportunity for a diplomatic breakthrough. Known as the Ten Days of Dawn, the lead-up to February 11 is typically marked by rallies and celebrations across Iran, and could provide a platform for both sides to engage in dialogue and ease tensions. For now, the fate of the imprisoned American hikers remains uncertain. While Ahmadinejad's comments suggest that negotiations for their release are ongoing, it is unclear when or if they will be freed. As the U.S. and Iran continue to clash over a wide range of issues, it remains to be seen whether a resolution can be found.","(489, 18)","(CNN) -- Ahead of the 31st anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad

The World Health Organization wants you to stop eating so much sugar. Seriously. In draft
","The World Health Organization wants you to stop eating so much sugar. Seriously. In draft guidelines proposed this week, WHO is encouraging people to consume less than 5% of their total daily calories from sugars. The organization's current guidelines, published in 2002, recommend eating less than 10% of your total daily calories from sugars. Most Americans still consume much more. Our sweet tooth increased 39% between 1950 and 2000, according to the USDA. The average American now consumes about three pounds of sugar each week. ""There is increasing concern that consumption of free sugars, particularly in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages, may result in ... an increase in total caloric intake, leading to an unhealthy diet, weight gain and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases,"" WHO said in a statement. Of particular concern, WHO said, is the role sugar plays in causing dental diseases worldwide. For an adult at a normal body mass index, or BMI, eating 5% would be around 25 grams of sugar -- or six teaspoons. That's less than is typically found in a single can of regular soda, which contains about 40 grams of sugar. Real or fake sugar: Does it matter? To find the amount of calories from sugar in a product, multiply the grams by 4. For example, a product containing 15 grams of sugar has 60 calories from sugar per serving, according to the American Heart Association. If you eat 2,000 calories a day, that's 3%. WHO's proposed guidelines apply to sugars added to foods by manufacturers, as well as those found naturally in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit concentrates. They do not apply to those found in fresh produce. ""Much of the sugars consumed today are 'hidden' in processed foods that are not usually seen as sweets,"" the WHO website states. Did you know sugar is often added to your frozen pizza? How about your bread, soup, yogurt and mayonnaise? As consumers became more concerned about the amount of fat in their food, manufacturers went out of their way to make low-fat items -- often substituting sugar to preserve the taste. Choosing foods with fewer added sugars at the grocery story may soon get a little easier. The Food and Drug Administration has proposed several changes to the nutrition labels you see on packaged foods and beverages. The proposed labels would also note how much added sugar is in a product. Right now, it's hard to know what is naturally occurring sugar and what has been added by the manufacturer. The WHO guidelines will be open for public comment until March 31. Then WHO will finalize and publish its recommendations.","(507, 27)","The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued new guidelines that suggest people should consume less than 5% of their total daily calorie intake from sugars. This recommendation comes as concerns about the impact of sugar on health continue to grow. For an adult with a normal body mass index (BMI), consuming 5% of their daily calories in the form of sugar would equate to around 25 grams per day. This is equivalent to around six teaspoons of sugar. Excessive sugar intake has been linked to a wide range of health problems, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. However, one of the biggest concerns for the WHO is the role that sugar plays in causing dental diseases. According to the WHO, dental diseases affect around 3.5 billion people worldwide. These conditions range from cavities to gum disease and can cause significant pain and discomfort. In severe cases, dental diseases can even lead to tooth loss, which can have a negative impact on a person's overall health and wellbeing. One of the primary causes of dental disease is the bacteria that inhabit the oral cavity. These bacteria feed on sugar, which provides them with the energy they need to survive and reproduce. The more sugar a person consumes, the more fuel these bacteria have, which can lead to an overgrowth and subsequent dental problems. Understanding the impact of sugar on dental health is important, but it is also critical to recognize that consuming too much sugar can have negative effects throughout the body. When people consume large amounts of sugar, their bodies are forced to produce high levels of insulin to deal with the glucose that is released into the bloodstream. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance, which in turn increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Given all of these concerns, the WHO's new guidelines are welcome news. However, it is important to note that cutting back on sugar can be challenging, especially given its pervasive presence in many processed foods and drinks. To help avoid excessive sugar intake, people should focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible and limit their intake of sugary treats and drinks. Ultimately, the WHO's new guidelines are an important reminder of the need to pay attention to our sugar intake, not just for our dental health, but for our overall wellbeing. By making conscious choices about what we eat and drink, we can help reduce our risk of developing a wide range of health problems, from tooth decay to cardiovascular disease.","(478, 20)","The World Health Organization wants you to stop eating so much sugar. Seriously. In draft
guidelines released this week, the United Nations health agency said people should limit their
sugar intake to less than 5 percent of their total daily calories. That’s about 25 grams, or six
teaspoons, of sugar per day for adults with a normal body mass index (BMI), which is a measure
of body fat based on height and weight.
That’s a lot less than the average American consumes, which is about 22 teaspoons of added
sugar per day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And it’s even less
than what the American Heart Association recommends, which is no more than 6 teaspoons of
added sugar per day for women and 9 teaspoons for men.
So why is the WHO being so strict? Because sugar is bad for your health. It’s linked to obesity,
type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions. And it’s not just the amount of
sugar you eat that matters; it’s also the type of sugar. Refined sugars, like those found in candy
and soda, are particularly harmful because they’re quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and
cause a spike in blood sugar levels. This can lead to insulin resistance, which is a precursor to
type 2 diabetes.
The WHO’s new guidelines are part of a larger effort to reduce the global burden of non-
communicable diseases (NCDs), which are chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, cancer,
and diabetes. These diseases are responsible for more than 70 percent of all deaths worldwide,
and they’re on the rise. In fact, NCDs are now the leading cause of death in low- and middle-
income countries.
So what can you do to reduce your sugar intake? The first step is to be aware of how much
sugar you’re eating. Start by reading food labels and looking for hidden sources of sugar, like
high-fructose corn syrup. Then, make an effort to cut back on sugary foods and drinks, like
candy, soda, and fruit juice. Instead, choose healthier options like fruits, vegetables, whole
grains, and low-fat dairy products.
You can also try to limit your intake of refined carbohydrates, like white bread and pasta. These
foods are quickly broken down into sugar in the body, which can lead to spikes in blood sugar
levels. Instead, choose complex carbohydrates, like whole wheat bread and brown rice, which
are digested more slowly and don’t cause as much of a blood sugar spike.
Finally, make sure you’re getting enough physical activity. Exercise helps to regulate blood
sugar levels and can help to prevent weight gain. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-
intensity exercise, like brisk walking, most days of the week.
By following these tips, you can help to reduce your risk of developing NCDs and improve your
overall health. So next time you reach for a sugary snack, think twice. Your body will thank you
for it.","(588, 29)","The World Health Organization wants you to stop eating so much sugar. Seriously. In draft
guidelines released this week, the WHO recommends that adults consume no more than 5
percent of their daily calories from added sugars. That’s about 25 grams for a 2,000-calorie
diet, or about 6 teaspoons of sugar a day.
The new guidelines are based on a review of more than 400 studies on the health effects of
sugars. The review found that consuming more than 10 percent of your daily calories from
added sugars is associated with an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease,
and tooth decay.
The WHO’s recommendations are similar to those of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for
Americans, which recommend that adults limit added sugars to less than 10% of their daily
calories. But the WHO’s guidelines are more specific. They recommend that children and
adolescents limit their added sugar intake to 5 percent of their total daily calories, and that
women of childbearing age limit their intake to 6 percent.
The guidelines also recommend that people limit their intake of free sugars, which are
added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook, or consumer. Free sugars include
sucrose, fructose, glucose, honey, and syrups. They do not include sugars that occur naturally
in foods, such as lactose in milk, fructose in fruit, and sucrose in table sugar. The WHO
recommends that adults limit their free sugar intake to no more than the equivalent of 10
teaspoons of sugar per day, or 50 grams (about 6 teaspoons).
The WHO recommends that children and adolescents limit their free sugars intake to no
more than 12 teaspoons per day, which is equivalent to about 60 grams (or 9 teaspoons).
For adults with a normal body mass index (BMI), the WHO recommends limiting free sugar
intake to 6 teaspoons per day. For adults with a BMI of 25 or higher, the limit is 5 teaspoons
per day. The WHO defines a normal BMI as a body weight between 18.5 and 24.9 kilograms
per square meter (kg/m2). A BMI of 30 or higher is considered overweight, and a BMI of more
than 40 is considered obese.
According to the WHO, more than 180 countries have adopted or are in the process of
adopting the new guidelines. The guidelines will be published in the World Health

","By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . Alan Pardew believes Newcastle United now have the attacking options to frighten the Premier League's top four – while new signing Remy Cabella insists the club can end their 46-year wait for a trophy. The Magpies have brought in seven new players for this season and Pardew, having survived a torrid end to the previous campaign, is in optimistic mood. His side struggled for goals and failed to score in 12 league games from January onwards as fans called for the manager to be sacked. Raring to go: Remy Cabella (left) is confident Newcastle can end their 46-year wait for a trophy . Happy days: Alan Pardew (right) believes his attacking players can rival any in the league's top four . But owner Mike Ashley has backed his boss this summer and France international Cabella has been joined at St James' Park by Siem de Jong, Emmanuel Riviere, Facundo Ferreyra, Jack Colback, Daryl Janmaat and Ayoze Perez. United finished 10th last time around but Pardew is now far happier with his offensive personnel and has hailed their activity in the transfer market. 'I think we have done some terrific business this summer. It must please the Newcastle fans that we have signed some exciting, offensive players,' he said. 'And, for me, I feel far more comfortable with the team and that we can play a brand of football that is expected of us. New boy: Emmanuel Riviere (right) also showed promise during Newcastle's trip to Germany . Winning feeling: Rolando Aarons (left) also shone in pre-season and scored against Schalke last weekend . 'It is very difficult for the likes of the teams outside of the Champions League money to compete. But we are trying to do it in an educated manner. 'We've been accused of not spending the money we bring in, but now we have spent it and we can hope to get as close as we can. Certainly, offensively we are definitely stronger. There is no doubt about that.' Cabellea – a £12m arrival from Montpellier – scored his first goal during Sunday's 3-1 win over Schalke in Germany. And he is already eyeing the silverware which would signal the club's first since 1969. 'I hope we can win a cup this season. We play for that to win a trophy,' he said. 'There is a good feeling in the team at the moment and my adaptation is good. I have friends who are French and I am very happy to be here. I am just waiting for the first game now.'","(493, 27)","Newcastle United have made significant strides in improving their squad ahead of the new Premier League season with the addition of seven new players. Manager Alan Pardew is optimistic about his side's chances in the upcoming campaign, while summer signing Remy Cabella has set his sights on winning a trophy. The Magpies recruited Cabella from French outfit Montpellier, along with the likes of Siem de Jong, Jack Colback and Daryl Janmaat, as well as Emmanuel Riviere, Ayoze Perez and Facundo Ferreyra on loan. The club also managed to hold onto key players such as Moussa Sissoko and Tim Krul, giving the team a much-needed boost in quality. Speaking ahead of the season opener against Manchester City, Pardew stated that the Newcastle fans could expect an exciting campaign. He was pleased with the club's transfer business and believed that the new players would add depth and quality to the squad. The Magpies have struggled in recent seasons, finishing 10th in the Premier League in the 2013/14 campaign, and Pardew is keen to improve on that position. The addition of Cabella, in particular, has given the manager confidence that he has the tools to succeed. The Frenchman impressed during the World Cup and his creativity and vision will be crucial to Newcastle's success. Cabella, for his part, has set his sights high. The attacking midfielder believes that the Magpies can win a trophy this season if they work hard and remain focused. He has been impressed by the quality of his new teammates and believes that the club has the potential to challenge for silverware. The 24-year-old has also spoken of his excitement at playing in the Premier League and is relishing the challenge. He is confident that he can make a big impact at Newcastle and help the team achieve their goals. Newcastle have made a promising start to the season, winning their opening game against Southampton 2-1 with goals from Papiss Cisse and Sissoko. The Magpies put in a solid defensive display and showed plenty of attacking intent, much to the delight of their fans. Pardew has praised his new signings following the victory and believes that they will only get better as they adapt to the Premier League. He is hoping that the team can build on their early momentum and make a real statement in the league this season. It remains to be seen whether Newcastle can meet Cabella's lofty ambitions and win a trophy this year. However, the Frenchman's confidence and determination to succeed could be just what the Magpies need to push on and establish themselves as a force in English football once again.","(479, 20)","By.

(CNN) -- Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman
","(CNN) -- Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman in the prison where he is serving a 28-year sentence, his attorney told HLN, CNN's sister network, on Friday. Van der Sloot, who remains the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of American Natalee Holloway, and his unnamed fiancÃ©e are working on completing the paperwork required for the wedding, said attorney Maximo Altez. The couple hopes to be able to marry within the next two weeks, Altez said. They reportedly met while she was visiting another inmate at Miguel Castro Castro prison in San Juan de Lurigancho. Joran van der Sloot challenges extradition to U.S. Van der Sloot, 25, pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephany Flores, whose body was found in May 2010 in a Lima hotel room registered in the Dutchman's name. He also has been indicted in the United States on charges related to the disappearance of Holloway. Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham, Alabama. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance, but was never charged. He has denied responsibility for her disappearance. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of allegedly attempting to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. He was allegedly given $25,000, which authorities say he used to travel to Peru for a poker tournament.","(345, 13)","Infamous Dutch criminal Joran van der Sloot is planning to marry his Peruvian girlfriend in prison, according to reports. Van der Sloot, who is currently serving a 28-year sentence for the 2010 murder of Stephany Flores, will wed Leidy Figueroa next month, in what will be a controversial ceremony. Van der Sloot, who is notorious for his involvement in the disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005, has been criticized for his behavior and lack of remorse. However, his fiancée claims that he is a changed man and that the marriage will help him to turn his life around. According to sources, the wedding will be held in the maximum-security Castro Castro prison in Lima, where van der Sloot is currently being held. The couple have reportedly obtained permission from prison authorities for the ceremony, which will be a low-key affair with only a few guests in attendance. The news has sparked outrage among the families of van der Sloot's victims. Beth Holloway, the mother of Natalee, has accused him of manipulating and deceiving women for personal gain. ""He's not capable of sincere love, he only wants to use women for his own selfish purposes,"" she said. Van der Sloot's own mother, Anita, has also voiced her disapproval of the wedding. ""I do not agree with the wedding, I do not want it and I do not support it,"" she stated. The Peruvian government has yet to comment on the matter, but it is possible that the ceremony could be cancelled if it is deemed to be a security risk. Van der Sloot's notoriety has made him a widely disliked and feared figure in Peruvian prisons, where he is believed to have been the victim of several violent attacks. Whether or not the marriage will benefit him in any way remains to be seen.","(349, 14)","(CNN) -- Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman
while serving a 28-year prison sentence for the 2010 murder of Stephany Flores.
Van der Sloot's lawyer, Maximo Altez, confirmed to CNN that his client is engaged
to Leidy Figueroa, a 22-year-old Peruvian woman who has been visiting him in prison.
Altez said the wedding will take place in the next few months, but he did not
specify an exact date. He said Figueroa and van der Sloot have known each other
for about a year and a half.
Figueroa has visited van der Sloot several times at the Miguel Castro Castro
prison in Lima, where he is serving time for the murder of Flores, a 21-year-old
Peruvian business student who was found dead in a Lima hotel room after van der
Sloot had met her in a casino. Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years in prison
in 2012 after pleading guilty to the crime.
He is also the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee
Holloway, who went missing while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. Van
der Sloot has denied any involvement in Holloway's disappearance.
Altez told CNN that van der Sloot and Figueroa are ""very much in love"" and that
the wedding will take place inside the prison. He added that Figueroa has been
visiting van der Sloot since last year and that they have been communicating
through letters and phone calls. Altez said van der Sloot proposed to Figueroa
earlier this year and that she accepted his proposal.
The lawyer said van der Scoot's family is aware of the engagement and that they
are supportive of the relationship. He added that van der Scoot is looking forward
to the wedding and that he is excited to start a new chapter in his life with
Figueroa. Altez declined to comment on whether van der Scoot would be allowed to
leave prison for the wedding or whether Figueroa would be allowed to enter the
prison for the ceremony. He said the details of the wedding are still being worked
out and that more information will be released in the coming weeks.
Van der Scoot's engagement comes as he continues to serve his sentence for the
murder of Flores. He has maintained his innocence in the case and has claimed
that he acted in self-defense after Flores attacked him. However, prosecutors
argued that he killed Flores in a fit of rage after losing a large sum of money
at the casino. Van der Scoot has also been linked to the disappearance of Holloway
in Aruba, but he has never been charged in that case.
The news of van der Sloot's engagement has drawn mixed reactions from the public.
Some people have expressed support for the couple, while others have criticized
van der Sloot for moving on with his life while serving a lengthy prison sentence.
However, Altez has defended his client's decision to get married, saying that it
is a personal choice and that he should be allowed to start a new life with the
woman he loves. He added that the wedding will be a private affair and that it
will not be open to the public.","(586, 23)","(CNN) -- Convicted killer Joran van der Sloot is planning to wed a Peruvian woman

","Serena Williams has withdrawn from the China Open with a knee injury. The world No 1 was due to face Sam Stosur on Friday, but the Australian will now advance straight into the last four. Williams, who won the US Open last month to join Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert on 18 grand slam singles titles, also pulled out of the Wuhan Open in China last week through illness.

She explained that she felt pain during her 6-1 1-6 6-2 win over 13th seed Lucie Safarova on Thursday and has now decided to join her sister Venus in withdrawing from the competition. 'I started to feel pain this week,' she told www.wtatennis.com. 'It didn't feel really well last night at all. I almost didn't go on the court - I did at the last minute. I think it made it a little worse, to be honest. 'It throbs just sitting, standing. I felt it mostly serving because I'm landing on my left knee. That was really killer for me. Moving was okay - I didn't do a tremendous amount of moving last night. I just tried to move as little as possible. So yeah, I felt it mostly when I was serving during the match. 'I haven't had time to get an MRI scan yet, but I'll do that and see what the problem is.' Stosur, who won the 2011 US Open, will now face third seed Petra Kvitova in the semis after the Czech took an hour and 35 minutes to dispatch Roberta Vinci 7-6 (7/2) 6-4 on Friday.

Williams was due to face Stosur on Friday, but decided to withdraw from the tournament after feeling pain in her body. The 34-year-old American had beaten 13th seed Lucie Safarova on Thursday in a tough match that saw her win 6-1, 1-6, 6-2, but she admitted to experiencing pain during the game. Williams said, ""I started to feel pain this week. It didn't feel really well last night at all. I almost didn't go on the court - I did at the last minute."" Her decision to withdraw came as a surprise to many, especially considering how dominant Williams has been over the years. The 22-time Grand Slam winner is known for her fighting spirit and willingness to play through injuries, but clearly, this latest issue was too much to bear. Williams' withdrawal also means that she will not be defending her China Open title, which she won last year. It could also have an impact on her ranking if she misses out on other tournaments in the coming weeks. In addition to Serena's withdrawal, her sister Venus Williams also withdrew from the tournament due to her own health concerns. The sisters have a long history in the sport and are known for their competitive nature, but the current situation demanded that they take a step back and prioritize their health. As for Stosur, she will now advance straight into the last four of the competition, where she will face the winner of the quarterfinal match between Agnieszka Radwanska and Daria Kasatkina. Stosur will no doubt be disappointed by the manner in which she advanced, but she will now have the opportunity to make it to the final and potentially win her first title of the year. In conclusion, the unexpected withdrawal of Serena Williams has placed a cloud over the China Open, but participants and fans alike will no doubt continue to enjoy the competition, hoping for a worthy winner as the tournament progresses.","(395, 15)","Serena Williams has withdrawn from the China Open with a knee injury.

Pupils would be grouped by ability in key subjects in every secondary school under the
","Pupils would be grouped by ability in key subjects in every secondary school under the plans . Secondary schools would be required to teach pupils in sets according to ability under plans being considered by the Tories. They would be penalised for teaching mixed-ability groups for key subjects under controversial proposals to make sets effectively compulsory. The idea is being considered for inclusion in the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto. It would build on the policy blueprint in 2010, which pledged to ‘encourage setting so those who are struggling get extra help and the most able are stretched’. One report claimed Downing Street was pushing for the policy to be announced sooner and had even booked a venue for a launch. But Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted in the Commons there was ‘absolutely no truth’ in the ‘rumours’. She said political opponents had a ‘rather unhealthy interest sometimes in speculating about what I am or am not about to announce’. In an interview she added: 'It’s not something I am looking at.' Both Labour and the Tories have long supported setting but stopped short of making it compulsory. However last year the head of Ofsted called for greater use of sets from age 11 to ensure the brightest pupils reach their potential. Figures suggest the practice of separating children into ability groups does not become widespread until children are 14. Even among older children, not all schools use ability groups in core subjects. Ofsted’s Sir Michael Wilshaw said: 'I’d set from the word go (in secondary schools). 'Too many non-selective schools are failing to nurture scholastic excellence.’ Sources said the idea was ‘under discussion’ and part of the ‘policy debate at the moment’. While in opposition David Cameron called for a ‘grammar stream’ in every subject in all comprehensives. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (left) denied claims the plans would be included in the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto. David Cameron (right) called for a 'grammar stream' in every subject in all comprehensives . He said: ‘I want to see setting in every single school. Parents know it works. Teachers know it works.’ It was claimed yesterday Mr Cameron’s advisers had drawn up plans for a compulsory setting policy. A source close to David Laws, the Lib Dem schools minister, said: ‘This has not been agreed with the Liberal Democrats and is not government policy. 'We don’t believe it would be appropriate to tie schools’ hands in this way.’ And Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘This is an area for teachers to decide and for results to speak for themselves.’ Research published two years ago by the Royal Economic Society showed a higher proportion of ‘low-achieving pupils’ in each class had a ‘negative and significant effect on the academic achievements of regular pupils’ because they monopolised teachers’ attention. The announcement of the plans comes as teachers have been told to consider using seating plans to split up troublemakers and stop pupils choosing to sit with friends.","(579, 24)","The Conservative Party is reportedly considering the inclusion of plans to group all key subjects in secondary schools by pupils' ability in its manifesto for the upcoming 2015 election. Sources within the party have revealed that the plans, which would entail the formation of a 'grammar stream' in every school, have been discussed at the highest levels. Party leader and Prime Minister David Cameron has been a proponent of such a scheme for some time, arguing that it would provide greater opportunities for academically gifted students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In a speech in 2014, Cameron stated that ""we should have a 'grammar stream' in every single school, so that we can stretch our brightest children to the utmost"". The proposed plans would see pupils divided into groups based on their academic ability, with those deemed to be the most capable placed in a 'grammar stream' focused on more challenging coursework. Proponents of the scheme argue that it would enable brighter students to advance at a faster pace, while also freeing up teachers to devote more attention to pupils who are struggling. However, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has denied that the plans will be included in the party's manifesto. Speaking in an interview for BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Morgan stated that ""we have no plans at this stage to introduce any kind of grammar stream or grammar schools"". The proposal has garnered mixed reactions from educational experts and policymakers. Supporters argue that it would allow schools to tailor their teaching methods to individual needs, while also promoting healthy competition among pupils. However, critics have expressed concerns that the scheme could further entrench socioeconomic divides, with disadvantaged pupils potentially being left behind. The prospect of a grammar stream in every school has also raised questions over the future of grammar schools themselves. Currently, grammar schools are only present in a select number of areas in England, and are widely considered to be a controversial form of education due to their selective admissions process. Opponents of grammar schools argue that they unfairly advantage wealthier families who can afford to pay for additional tutoring to prepare for the demanding entrance exams. Supporters, however, argue that they provide a vital form of high-quality education for academically gifted students who may struggle in comprehensive schools. It is unclear whether the Conservative Party will ultimately include plans for a 'grammar stream' in its manifesto for the 2015 election. However, the proposal has reignited a longstanding debate over the merits and drawbacks of selective education, and the best way to provide educational opportunities for all students, regardless of their backgrounds or abilities.","(482, 17)","Pupils would be grouped by ability in key subjects in every secondary school under the

A robber who stumbled and shot a medical student as he raided a fraternity residence
","A robber who stumbled and shot a medical student as he raided a fraternity residence has been found guilty of murder. Dajeon Franklin, 22, had no reaction when a jury convicted him of killing 25-year-old Paul DeWolf in Michigan University's Phi Rho Sigma house last year. He was also found guilty of three home invasions and unlawful possession of a firearm. Relief: Paul DeWolf's family hugged as Dajeon Franklin, 22, was found guilty of his murder last July . Killed: Paul DeWolf, an aspiring pilot, was sleeping in his basement bedroom when the three men broke in . Washtenaw County Court heard Franklin and two friends, 20-year-old Joei Jordan, and 21-year-old Shaquille Jones, broke into the medical fraternity in the early hours of July 24, 2013, and stumbled upon DeWolf sleeping in his basement bedroom. DeWolf and Franklin struggled, and the gun Franklin was holding went off, striking DeWolf in the neck, prosecutors said. DeWolf's body was found at the fraternity house on July 24, 2013, after he failed to show up for work at a hospital. 'That was very hard,' Paul DeWolf's father Thom DeWolf told Mlive after the verdict. 'You're sitting on pins and needles waiting for the answer. You think there would be some elation or happiness, but there's not. All it does, it's confirming Paul's death.' Robbery: Franklin got in a fight with DeWolf as he and two friends raided the residence at Michigan University . Shot: The gun Franklin was holding went off and hit DeWolf in the neck. DeWolf was found dead the next day . Walter White, Franklin's lawyer, questioned the evidence presented against his client, asking during his closing argument: 'What evidence do we have that Dajeon Franklin was even there and even part of this?' Franklin will be sentenced November 19. His friends and family members left the courtroom in tears, while DeWolf's supporters celebrated with hugs. Tragic: Paul DeWolf's sister Rebekah hugs a detective after Franklin was convicted of murder . DeWolf was from the southwestern Michigan community of Schoolcraft and a graduate of Grand Valley State University. He was a reservist second lieutenant and had planned to join the Air Force full time after graduation. Jordan and Jones are scheduled to stand trial early next year.","(437, 22)","A 22-year-old man named Dajeon Franklin has been convicted of murdering 25-year-old medical student and aspiring pilot, Paul DeWolf. The incident occurred in July of last year when Franklin broke into the Phi Rho Sigma house, located on the campus of the University of Michigan. According to reports, Franklin stumbled over DeWolf, who was sleeping in his room at the time of the break-in. A fight ensued, during which the gun Franklin was holding struck DeWolf, ultimately leading to his death. The aspiring pilot's lifeless body was discovered the following day, sending shockwaves through the campus and the wider Michigan community. Authorities were quick to pursue Franklin following the disturbing incident, and he was subsequently charged with murder. After a lengthy trial, a jury returned a verdict of guilty, and Franklin is now facing the prospect of life imprisonment for the senseless crime. The case has left a deep scar on the University of Michigan community, with many expressing shock and dismay at the loss of such a promising young talent. DeWolf was a beloved member of the Phi Rho Sigma fraternity, and his passion for medicine and flying had made him a popular figure on campus. Following the verdict, DeWolf's family released a statement expressing their relief at the outcome of the trial but also their continued sadness at the loss of their son. They urged the public and authorities to continue to fight against gun violence and to work towards a safer society for all. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan has taken steps to increase security measures across campus, with a view to preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future. Campus officials have also reached out to students and staff, offering support and counseling to anyone struggling with the loss of DeWolf. As the Michigan community continues to mourn the tragic loss of Paul DeWolf, the conviction of Dajeon Franklin serves as a reminder of the devastating impact that gun violence can have on individuals, families, and communities as a whole.

(CNN) -- Riccardo Ricco has been suspended by his Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team amid claims
","(CNN) -- Riccardo Ricco has been suspended by his Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team amid claims that the Italian gave himself a blood transfusion. Ricco -- who only returned to the sport last March after being handed a 20-month ban for doping during the 2008 Tour de France -- was admitted to a hospital in Modena on Sunday. His father told reporters at the time that Ricco had been suffering from a high fever and suspected kidney failure. But Italian media claimed the 27-year-old had admitted to doctors that he had made himself ill by injecting contaminated blood. And now his team have issued an official statement, saying they have found enough proof of a doping infraction to suspend the rider with immediate effect. The statement said: ""Internal research results following the illness and rumors regarding Ricco have given the team sufficient reason to suspend the Italian with immediate effect."" It continued: ""Last Tuesday, the team started an urgent investigation following the hospitalisation of Riccardo Ricco. Three days later the results of this study brought the team to the conclusion that an immediate suspension of Ricco was required. ""The violation of internal regulations of the team and other indications justify this measure. The team cannot prejudge but emphasises that a zero-tolerance policy towards doping is practised."" Blood doping -- an action that increases the amount of red blood cells available to carry oxygen to the muscles -- has been a problem in cycling for a number of years, with disgraced 2006 Tour de France winner Floyd Landis admitting last year that he blood-doped during his career. Blood cells are not damaged by freezing, consequently a ""blood doper"" can remove blood from their body, safely store it, and re-inject it when increased aerobic capacity and stamina is needed. However, if the blood is stored incorrectly, it can become infected, resulting in severe illness if transfused. The practice of blood doping is banned by all official sporting governing bodies and Ricco now faces expulsion from competitive cycling if found guilty, as well as a possible jail sentence in a country where all forms of doping are classed as illegal. Ricco has yet to react to the claims surrounding his hospital stay.","(405, 15)","Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team has announced the suspension of one of its star riders, Riccardo Ricco, after finding enough evidence of his involvement in doping. The team has not revealed the exact nature of the doping infractions, but it was severe enough to warrant suspension from the team. Ricco, a 27-year-old Italian, has been in the headlines for various controversies in the past, including being banned for 12 years by the Italian Olympic Committee for blood doping. His recent hospitalization has further fueled the speculations around his doping practices. Last week, Ricco was admitted to an Italian hospital with a high fever and kidney problems. Italian media claimed that the cyclist fell ill after injecting blood that was infected with a virus. There have been no official reports to confirm these claims. Ricco has been one of the most controversial riders in the sport of cycling, with a history of doping violations. In 2008, he was kicked out of the Tour de France after testing positive for the banned blood-booster EPO. The following year, he was found guilty of doping at the Giro d'Italia and was handed a 20-month ban. Despite the numerous controversies surrounding Ricco, many cycling fans and experts had believed that he had turned over a new leaf and was committed to riding clean. His performances on the road for Vacansoleil have been impressive in recent years, which made the team's decision to suspend him even more surprising. Vacansoleil has been one of the leading voices in the fight against doping in cycling, and their decision to suspend Ricco shows that they are willing to take a tough stance on those who cheat. In a statement released by the team, they said that they were disappointed by Ricco's actions and that they would not tolerate doping in any form. The suspension will no doubt have a significant impact on Ricco's career, as it will likely make it difficult for him to find a new team. It also highlights the ongoing challenges that the sport of cycling faces in the fight against doping. In conclusion, the suspension of Riccardo Ricco by Vacansoleil is a significant moment in the ongoing battle against doping in cycling. It shows that even high-profile riders are not immune to scrutiny and that teams are willing to take a tough stance against cheating. It also raises questions about the future of Ricco's career and the sport of cycling as a whole.","(446, 19)","(CNN) -- Riccardo Ricco has been suspended by his Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team amid claims

America's love affair with British Royalty continues as the second member of the Royal Family in as many weeks visits the States. This time it was the turn of the Queen's youngest son, Prince Edward to receive a taste of Southern hospitality as he met some charming young ladies from Tennessee. Governor Bill Haslam laid on the tea, crumpets and canapes followed by some hearty hamburgers and hot dogs whilst the prince chatted and joked with various beauty pageant winners. Nice work if you can get it: Britain's Prince Edward jokes with a group of beauty pageant winners at the Governor's Mansion on Thursday, May 23, 2013, in Nashville, Tennessee . Tiara inspection: Britain's Prince Edward talks with beauty pageant winners. Edward is visiting Nashville in support of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, part of a royal charity that benefits youth and education. The prince came to the aptly named Volunteer State as he took part in a tour to promote one of the British royal family's charities, the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. The prince presided over an awards ceremony at the governor's mansion in Nashville for the first batch of young Tennesseans to participate in the leadership and character program. He quipped that the participants were 'how should I put this - guinea pigs,' and then said, 'So you're leading the way here.' 'Welcome to an international family. It’s great to see Tennessee taking part in this program and supporting it so well.'

About 80 young people received the award by participating in community service, skills development, physical fitness and adventurous journeys through organizations such as the Boy Scouts, Boys and Girls Clubs and Miss Tennessee Scholarship Organization. The Duke of Edinburgh's Award is a self-development program for people aged 14 to 25 that aims to instill confidence and skills. The program in the U.S. was launched in 2007 and now operates in 30 states and the District of Columbia. The Nashville ceremony brought the program to Tennessee. Following the event, Gov. Bill Haslam and first lady Crissy Haslam invited the awardees and their families to tea inside the governor's residence. Last night, the prince headlined a black-tie Royal gala at Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville to raise funds for the award’s charities.","(526, 28)","Prince visits Tennessee to promote youth employment and training scheme Prince, the world-renowned musician, has arrived in the States to promote his youth employment and training scheme, aiming to help young people get on the career ladder. The musician is staying in Tennessee for the duration of his visit, where he is being hosted by the Governor of Tennessee, Bill Lee. The youth employment and training scheme is an initiative that aims to connect young people with employment opportunities, as well as provide them with the necessary training to succeed in their roles. The scheme is open to young people between the ages of 18 and 30 who are struggling to find employment or training opportunities. Prince is passionate about helping young people to succeed in their careers, and has put a lot of effort into developing this scheme. With his unique experience and expertise, he hopes to be able to inspire and motivate young people to achieve their career goals. During his visit to Tennessee, Prince will be visiting a number of businesses and organizations that are involved with the youth employment and training scheme. He will also be meeting with young people who are currently enrolled in the program, to hear about their experiences and provide them with guidance and support. One of the main objectives of the youth employment and training scheme is to help young people who are struggling to find meaningful employment. This is an issue that is particularly prevalent in Tennessee, where youth unemployment rates are some of the highest in the United States. By promoting the scheme in Tennessee, Prince hopes to inspire other states to implement similar initiatives and help young people across America to get on the career ladder. Speaking about his visit, Prince said: ""I am thrilled to be in Tennessee to promote the youth employment and training scheme. Young people are the future of our country, and we need to do all we can to help them succeed in their careers. I am honored to be hosted by Governor Lee, and I look forward to meeting with young people and businesses to discuss how we can work together to help young people get on the career ladder."" Governor Lee also commented on the visit, stating: ""We are delighted to have Prince here in Tennessee to promote this important initiative. We recognize the challenges that many young people face when it comes to finding work or training opportunities, and we are committed to working with Prince and other organizations to help young people achieve their career goals."" The youth employment and training scheme is a valuable initiative that has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of young people across America. With the support of Prince, and the commitment of organizations and businesses across the country, we can create more opportunities for young people and help them to achieve their career ambitions.","(528, 18)","By.

BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- Women's boxing will be included at the 2012 Olympic Games in
","BERLIN, Germany (CNN)  -- Women's boxing will be included at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the president of the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday. Germany's Ina Menzer, left, fights American Franchesca Alcanter during a WIBF and WBC featherweight bout in May. The decision came during a two-day IOC Executive Board meeting in Berlin, at which board members also decided to propose golf and rugby for inclusion in the 2016 Olympic Games. ""I can only rejoice about the decision of inclusion of women's boxing,"" IOC President Jacques Rogge told reporters. ""I think it's a great decision. Boxing was the sole (Olympic) sport with no women involved.  ""The sport of women's boxing has progressed a lot, a tremendous amount, in the last five years and it was about time to include them in the Games.""  Have your say - should women's boxing be included? A men's class will likely be axed to make room for three women's weight categories at London 2012, the UK Press Association reported. Women will compete in the flyweight 48-51kg class, lightweight 56-60kg and middleweight 69-75kg, the agency said. When the IOC dropped baseball and softball from the 2012 Olympic program several years ago, it said it would consider adding new sports that had a clean reputation and a wide appeal. Rogge pointed out that women's boxing has around 200 athletes who could potentially compete in 2012, while softball has only around 120. As a result, he said, the IOC considered women's boxing to be more popular. Women's boxing has boomed in Britain since 2005, with the number of registered female fighters rising from 50 to 600, PA reported. Softball and baseball were considered for inclusion in the 2016 Games along with squash, karate, roller sports, golf and rugby, but the board decided to consider only the last two. Blog: IOC has picked the wrong sports, says CNN's Paul Gittings . The IOC has not yet selected the host city for 2016, but its board members will submit golf and rugby to the full IOC session for a final decision at its meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October. ""Golf and rugby scored high on all the criteria,"" Rogge told the IOC's official Web site. ""They have global appeal, a geographically diverse line-up of top iconic athletes and an ethic that stresses fair play."" The International Golf Federation has proposed two four-day strokeplay tournaments for men and women, with 18 holes per round and medals awarded to the three players in each with the lowest scores. The International Rugby Board has proposed men's and women's Sevens tournaments, with 12 teams in each being divided into two pools before semifinals and finals.","(521, 21)","In a historic move for women in sports, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that women's boxing will finally be included in the 2012 Olympic Games in London. This means that for the first time ever, female boxers will be competing alongside their male counterparts for Olympic gold. Up until now, boxing had been the only Olympic event without any female participants. Critics argued that this was outdated and unfair, pointing to the growing popularity of women's boxing around the world. However, it wasn't until recently that the IOC finally agreed to take action. Female boxers will compete in three weight categories: flyweight (48-51kg), lightweight (56-60kg) and middleweight (69-75kg). This will provide a platform for a number of talented female boxers to showcase their skills, and will hopefully inspire more young girls to take up the sport. But boxing isn't the only sport to be considered for inclusion in the Olympics. The IOC is also looking at golf and rugby for the 2016 Summer Games. Both sports have a strong international following, and many believe that they would be a great addition to the Olympic lineup. However, not all sports were so lucky. Softball, squash, baseball, karate and roller sports were all rejected for inclusion in the Olympics. This comes as a disappointment to many athletes and fans of these sports, who had been hoping for their chance to compete on the world stage. Softball, in particular, has a strong case for inclusion. The sport has a large following in many countries, including the United States and Japan, and has been part of the Olympics before. However, the IOC has cited concerns over the lack of global participation as a reason for its exclusion. Similarly, squash and karate have both been seeking Olympic inclusion for years. Squash is played in over 185 countries and has a strong following in many Commonwealth nations, while karate is practiced by millions of people around the world. However, the IOC has yet to be convinced of their Olympic appeal. Whether these sports will ever be included in the Olympics remains to be seen. However, for now, the focus is on women's boxing and the groundbreaking role it will play in the 2012 London Games. With this announcement, the IOC has taken a big step towards gender equality in sports, and has shown its commitment to creating a level playing field for all athletes.","(461, 22)","BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- Women's boxing will be included at the 2012 Olympic Games in

Police have said Kyle Randall is believed to have driven through a stop sign before colliding with the moving train in Jefferson, Oregon. The train reportedly dragged the car 300ft before continuing on its journey towards Independence, Oregon. Following the collision however, the 24-year-old managed to free himself from the wreckage. He then went to seek shelter at nearby homes, investigators have claimed. Marion County deputies were first called to the area on Saturday morning after residents reported a man knocking on doors asking for somewhere to sleep, Fox 12 Oregon has reported. Officers discovered Randall's burnt out car after a plume of smoke caught their attention. Marion County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sergeant Chris Baldridge told the Statesman Journal that Randall was being charged with a misdemeanor DUI. He said: 'In order for it to be a felony, you have to have multiple convictions of DUI.' Randall is reportedly facing a single charge because damage was only caused to his property.

The incident took place on Wednesday afternoon in West Virginia when Kyle Randall failed to stop at the sign and collided with the train. The train reportedly dragged the car, with Randall still inside, for 300ft. Randall sustained minor injuries and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. After being released from the hospital, he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence. Randall is due to appear in court next month on a misdemeanor DUI charge.

The consequences of such actions can not only lead to a collision but can also result in fatalities. Therefore, it is essential that drivers remain cautious and alert at all times when on the road. Train accidents are not uncommon in West Virginia due to the abundance of railway tracks in the area. In 2018 alone, there were 31 train collisions in the state. However, many of these incidents were caused by driver error, such as failing to stop at railroad crossings or attempting to beat the train.

London (CNN) -- Vertical gardens are cropping up all over cities these days, transforming drab
","London (CNN) -- Vertical gardens are cropping up all over cities these days, transforming drab urban facades into vibrant jungles of color. These lush expanses have found their way onto the walls -- both inside and out -- on numerous sites in recent years revitalizing public buildings, hotels, offices and even a multi-storey car park in Netherlands. Aside from their pleasing aesthetic qualities, vertical gardens could also deliver more practical benefits says Mark Laurence, creative director at Biotecture, a UK company who design and build green walls. ""The market is rapidly moving into looking at how they can provide eco-system services and green infrastructures for urban environments,"" Laurence said. Their modular hydroponic system -- where plants sit in a soil-free set up with nutrients delivered through irrigation channels -- can be retrofitted to just about any wall. A recent creation erected on the side of Edgware Road Underground station in central London is hoping to improve air quality. The 200-square meter wall near Marylebone Road -- one of the UK capital's grimiest thoroughfares -- is being monitored by Imperial College, London. ""They have taken initial samples and going at regular intervals to take leaf samples. Then they wash these leaf samples to see how much particulate matter has adhered to the leaves,"" said Laurence. The leaves also have an electrostatic charge that also attracts particles. ""A researcher I was speaking to recently reckons green walls in urban canyon environments (areas where walls are higher than the width of the road separating them) are more effective than trees at collecting particles because the way the wind eddies around and then moves down the wall,"" Laurence said. Some believe that in less polluted areas, green walls could be employed to grow food, which could aid urban food security. Biotecture have successfully trialled a wall which grew 45 varieties of vegetable. Furthermore, there's nothing stopping people building their own, more basic green walls at home, Laurence says. There are various systems for DIY constructions with most requiring a compost-based system, he says, but homemade hydroponic systems can be made using plastic bottles. All you need is irrigation and adequate light.","(402, 16)","A new green wall has been installed near the busy Marylebone Road in London, offering much more than just a stunning vista. Green walls, also known as vertical gardens, have the ability to transform an otherwise plain, concrete building into a colorful and eco-friendly masterpiece. The green wall in Marylebone is expected to improve air quality in the congested urban area, according to the experts behind the initiative. It is widely believed that green walls have the potential to reduce the amount of pollutants in the air by absorbing them through photosynthesis. This new installation is the latest effort to combat the high levels of air pollution in the city. Aside from the ecological benefits, vertical gardens have become an increasingly popular means of enhancing the aesthetic appeal of urban areas. The green wall in Marylebone is no exception, as it radiates a radiant combination of colors and textures that add some much-needed warmth to the dreary concrete facades surrounding it. Green walls can also provide insulation for buildings, reducing the amount of energy needed to cool or heat the interior. This can result in significant savings for building owners, both financially and environmentally. The green wall in Marylebone is just one of many similar initiatives that have been launched in recent years. From New York to Tokyo, vertical gardens have become an integral part of modern cityscapes, with an increasing number of people realizing the benefits of green installations in urban environments. As these initiatives continue to gain momentum, it is becoming increasingly clear that green walls are not just a temporary trend, but a vital part of the sustainable future of cities. Policymakers are now starting to take notice, with green walls and other related initiatives being increasingly implemented in cities across the world. As the population of cities continues to grow, so does the importance of implementing creative and sustainable solutions for urban environments. The green wall in Marylebone is just the latest example of how cities can use innovative solutions to combat the negative effects of urbanization while also improving the lives of city-dwellers with added beauty and health benefits. It remains to be seen what other creative sustainability solutions will emerge, but green walls are an excellent reminder that there are many ways to make cities more livable and eco-friendly.","(417, 16)","London (CNN) -- Vertical gardens are cropping up all over cities these days, transforming drab
urban facades into living works of art. But they can do more than just look good. They can also
improve air quality, according to a new study.
Researchers at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom have found that green walls can
reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a pollutant linked to respiratory problems, by up to 30%.
The study, published in the journal Environmental Pollution, looked at the impact of a green wall
near Marylebone Road, one of London's busiest thoroughfares. It found that NO2 levels were
significantly lower on the side of the building with the green wall than on the side without it.
The researchers say the results suggest that green walls could be an effective way to reduce air
pollution in urban areas. ""Our findings show that green walls can play an important role in
improving air quality in cities,"" said study co-author Dr. David Werner. ""They can help to reduce
levels of NO2, which is a major contributor to poor air quality in urban areas.""
Green walls are becoming increasingly popular in cities around the world. They are often used to
improve the appearance of buildings, but they can also have a positive impact on the environment.
By reducing levels of NO2, green walls can help to improve air quality and reduce the risk of
respiratory problems. This is especially important in urban areas, where air pollution is often a
problem. The study found that the green wall near Marylebone Road reduced NO2 levels by up to
30%. This is a significant reduction, and it shows that green walls can have a real impact on air
quality. The researchers say that more research is needed to determine the full extent of the
benefits of green walls. However, their findings suggest that they could be a valuable tool in the
fight against air pollution. Green walls are not the only way to improve air quality in cities. There
are many other measures that can be taken, such as reducing traffic, improving public transport,
and planting more trees. However, green walls are a relatively simple and cost-effective way to
make a difference. They can be installed on any type of building, and they do not require a lot of
maintenance. In addition, they can provide a number of other benefits, such as improving the
appearance of buildings and providing a habitat for wildlife. Green walls are a win-win solution for
cities. They can improve air quality, reduce the risk of respiratory problems, and make cities more
attractive and livable. As the popularity of green walls continues to grow, it is likely that we will
see more and more of them in our cities in the years to come.","(527, 25)","London (CNN) -- Vertical gardens are cropping up all over cities these days, transforming drab

","(CNN) -- The rivalry is so intense that Barnes & Noble actually spoke its competitor's name: . ""Kindle Fire is deficient for a media tablet,"" Barnes & Noble CEO William Lynch said as he unveiled his company's Nook Tablet on Monday. ""Content will render better on Nook than on Kindle Fire."" That jab essentially re-opened the fight between Barnes & Noble and Amazon over customers looking for digital-book-reading devices. Round I in this donnybrook was between the Nook and Kindle e-readers. Next week, however, both companies will put their next-generation tablets on the market, setting up a new battle for holiday shoppers looking for gadgets that are good for reading books, watching videos and browsing the Internet. Here's a quick comparison of the devices, which are called the Nook Tablet and Kindle Fire. (The gist, in case you're in a hurry, is that they're pretty darn similar; the Kindle costs $50 less, while the Nook has twice the storage space and a longer advertised battery life). Price . Nook Tablet: $249 . Kindle Fire: $199 . Sale date . Nook Tablet: November 17 . Kindle Fire: November 15 . Screens . Both: 7-inch touch-sensitive screen with color display . Purpose . Both: Reading books, watching videos and browsing the Web. Both of these devices are more focused on the book-reading experience than the Apple iPad, which dominates the tablet field. Operating system . Both: Customized versions of Google Android . Apps . You'd think these Android-based tablets would give owners access to the popular Google Android Market, which houses more than 250,000 apps. But no. Barnes & Noble and Amazon require users to purchase apps through online stores that they've created. Nook Tablet: ""Thousands of must-have apps,"" the company says, including Angry Birds, Scrabble, Bejeweled and Epicurious. Kindle Fire: ""All the most popular apps and games,"" including Angry Birds and Plants vs. Zombies. Storage space . Nook Tablet: 16 GB . Kindle Fire: 8 GB . Memory . Nook Tablet: 1GB of RAM . Kindle Fire: 512 MB of RAM, according to Computerworld . Weight: . Nook Tablet: 14.1 ounces . Kindle Fire: 14.6 ounces . Battery life: . Nook Tablet: 11.5 hours of reading or 9 hours of video . Kindle Fire: 8 hours of reading or 7.5 hours of video with Wi-Fi turned off . Books: . Nook Tablet: More than 2.5 million titles . Kindle Fire: More than 1 million current titles and 2 million out-of-copyright .","(488, 42)","Barnes & Noble has recently launched the Nook Tablet, a device that aims to compete directly with the Amazon Kindle Fire. Both of these tablets come with color screens and tie in with the content libraries offered by their respective companies. The Nook, which is priced at $249, is $50 more expensive than the Kindle Fire but still considerably cheaper than Apple’s iPad. The Nook Tablet comes with a 7-inch touchscreen display, which boasts a resolution of 1024x600 pixels. It is powered by a 1GHz dual-core processor and comes with 1GB of RAM, as well as 16GB of built-in storage. It also has a microSD slot, which allows you to expand its storage capacity by up to 32GB. One of the big selling points of the Nook Tablet is its weight. At just 14.1 ounces, it is significantly lighter than the iPad, which weighs in at 1.33 pounds. This makes the Nook more portable and easier to take with you on-the-go. In terms of software, the Nook Tablet runs on Android 2.3 Gingerbread, which has been heavily customized by Barnes & Noble. This includes a custom home screen that highlights the different types of content available, as well as deeper integration with Barnes & Noble services such as its online bookstore. One key feature of the Nook Tablet is its access to Barnes & Noble’s content library, which includes over 2.5 million books, magazines, newspapers, and other types of content. This is comparable to Amazon’s Kindle store, which also offers access to millions of books, magazines, and other types of content. Despite the Nook Tablet’s impressive specs and feature-set, its $249 price point puts it at a disadvantage compared to the Kindle Fire. The Amazon device is currently priced at just $199, which makes it considerably cheaper than the Nook. However, it’s worth noting that the Nook comes with twice as much built-in storage as the Kindle Fire, which only has 8GB. Overall, the Nook Tablet is an impressive device that offers a lot of value for its price. It offers a great way to access Barnes & Noble’s content library and provides a wealth of feature-rich functionalities that make it an exciting device to own. However, with the cheaper Kindle Fire also available, it will be interesting to see how the market responds to this new entrant in the tablet space.","(452, 19)","(CNN) -- The rivalry is so intense that Barnes & Noble actually spoke its competitor's

A couple made their adopted teenage daughter to wear a shock collar around her neck which transmitted an electric charge as a punishment method, U.S. authorities have reported. Investigators said the 15-year-old girl from Butler in Georgia, was also made to live in a chicken coop. The collar was discovered at the home of the girl's guardians Diana and Samuel Franklin and the couple were arrested on Tuesday morning, according to WTVM. Discipline device: The shock collar which Diana and Samuel Franklin reportedly used to discipline their adopted teenage daughter when she failed to do chores . Accused: Authorities reportedly say that Diana Franklin, left, and husband Samuel were arrested on Tuesday and are expected to face charges of cruelty to children and false imprisonment . The girl told Georgia Bureau of . Investigation (GBI) agents that her parents shocked her with the collar . several times using a remote key fob. GBI's Wayne Smith told WSB radio in Atlanta: 'The child basically said that there . were just a series of fairly severe, what can be described as . punishments, for various things that the child allegedly did — some as . simple as not doing homework and then others like taking food.' The collar, which usually used on dogs, is now being tested by forensic experts for DNA matches, and reports say it matches the description that the teen gave to agents. Diana Franklin is facing 12 counts of cruelty to children and four counts of false imprisonment, while her Mr Franklin is facing eight counts of cruelty to children and eight counts of false imprisonment. Shocking: The girl was allegedly forced to stay in a chicken coop by Dian and Samuel Franklin . Home: The house where the Franklins live with their adopted daughter in Butler, Georgia . Investigators first started looking into the case at the end of May after receiving tip offs that the girl was being mistreated. Neighbours reported seeing the girl carrying out hard manual labour tasks. Steven Bails said: 'I've seen her out working in the gardens, digging ditches in the hot sun with two or three older boys watching her. 'I've seen her toting rocks up the road - she looked like she was in rough shape.' Another neighbor said Diana Franklin told her she was 'doing what the Bible says' when she disciplined her daughter. The neighbour, who did not give their name told WTVM that the mother would only feed the teen bread and water for days as a punishment. A custody hearing for the teen is due to take place today with the District Attorney taking it over when the criminal investigation is completed. The girl has been in temporary custody of the Department of Family and Child Services for the last few weeks. Use: The shock collar is supposed to be used as an instrument to discipline dogs, as shown here .","(560, 32)","A shocking case of child abuse has come to light after a girl was reportedly given an electric charge for not doing her homework or taking food. The victim, an adopted girl, is said to have been subjected to brutal punishment at the hands of her guardian Diana Franklin. According to reports, Diana Franklin not only gave electric charges to the girl but also told her neighbour that she was 'doing what the bible says'. The neighbour, who remains anonymous, reported the incident to the authorities. The girl's exact age and identity remains unknown, but sources close to the investigation revealed that she suffered from learning difficulties. This makes the abuse she suffered even more disturbing, as she may not have fully understood the consequences of her behaviour. The use of electric charges as a form of punishment is barbaric and illegal. It is believed that the girl was hooked up to a device and then given electric shocks for disobeying Franklin's rules. It is unclear how long this abuse went on for, but neighbours have reported hearing screams and cries coming from Franklin's house at various times of the day and night. It is possible that the girl was being punished regularly and brutally. No arrests have yet been made in the case, but investigations are ongoing. Franklin has remained tight-lipped about the allegations and has not yet spoken publicly about them. Child abuse is a serious problem in many parts of the world, and cases like this serve as a stark reminder of the pain and suffering that children can endure at the hands of those who should be protecting them. The use of electric shocks is particularly concerning, as it shows a willingness to inflict severe pain and suffering. This case has sparked outrage and renewed calls for more to be done to protect vulnerable children from abusive guardians. Many have called for stricter laws and better support services for those who have suffered abuse. In the meantime, the victim in this case is receiving medical and psychological support to help her recover from the trauma she has endured. Her future remains uncertain, but it is hoped that justice will be served and that she will be able to live a life free from abuse and fear. No child should ever have to endure the kind of abuse that this girl allegedly suffered. It is up to all of us to stand up for the rights of children and to speak out against abuse wherever we see it. Only then can we hope to create a safer and more compassionate world for all children to grow up in.","(479, 21)","By. Phil Vinter. PUBLISHED:. 06:13 EST, 12 July 2012. |.
A seven-year-old adopted girl was allegedly given an electric shock by her adoptive mother after she refused to do her homework or eat her dinner.
Diana Franklin, 49, is said to have told a neighbour that she was ‘doing what the Bible says’ when she shocked the child with a Taser stun gun.
The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been taken into care after the alleged incident at the family’s home in North Carolina, US.
Franklin, who has two other adopted children, has been charged with one count of assault on a child under the age of 12 and one count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
She appeared in court yesterday and was released on a $5,000 (£3,100) bond. She is due to appear in court again on August 6.
According to a police report, the girl told a neighbour that her adoptive mother had shocked her with a Taser because she would not do her homework and refused to eat her dinner.
When the neighbour asked the girl if she had been hurt, she replied: ‘Yes, but I’m OK.’
The neighbour then called the police and the girl was taken to hospital where she was found to have no physical injuries.
The girl told police that she had been shocked with the Taser three times – once on her arm, once on her leg and once on her back.
She also said that she had been hit with a belt and a wooden spoon.
The girl’s adoptive father, who has not been named, told police that he was not at home at the time of the incident.
He said that his wife had told him that she had used the Taser on the girl because she was being disobedient.
He said that he did not know that his wife had a Taser and that he had never seen her use it before.
The girl’s biological mother, who has also not been named, said that she had given her daughter up for adoption because she was unable to care for her.

Your article is well-written and informative. It provides all the necessary details about the incident and its aftermath.
However, there are a few areas where you could improve your writing.
Firstly, you could add more background information about the girl and her adoptive parents. This would help readers understand the context of the incident and why it happened.
Secondly, you could provide more details about the Taser stun gun and how it was used. This would give readers a better understanding of the severity of the incident.
Finally, you could include some quotes from the girl’s adoptive parents and neighbours. This would add a personal touch to the article and make it more engaging for readers.
Overall, your article is a good start, but there is room for improvement. Keep up the good work!","(711, 36)","By . Phil Vinter . PUBLISHED: . 06:13 EST, 12 July 2012 . | .

A seven-year-old adopted girl was allegedly given an electric shock by her adoptive mother after she refused to do her homework or eat her dinner.
Diana Franklin, 49, is said to have told a neighbour that she was ‘doing what the Bible says’ when she shocked the child with a Taser stun gun.
The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been taken into care after the alleged incident at the family’s home in North Carolina, US.
Franklin, who has two other adopted children, has been charged with one count of assault on a child under the age of 12 and one count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
She appeared in court yesterday and was released on a $5,000 (£3,100) bond. She is due to appear in court again on August 6.
According to a police report, the girl told a neighbour that her adoptive mother had shocked her with a Taser because she would not do her homework and refused to eat her dinner.
When the neighbour asked the girl if she had been hurt, she replied: ‘Yes, but I’m OK.’
The neighbour then called the police and the girl was taken to hospital where she was found to have no physical injuries.
The girl told police that she had been shocked with the Taser three times – once on her arm, once on her leg and once on her back.
She also said that she had been hit with a belt and a wooden spoon.
The girl’s adoptive father, who has not been named, told police that he was not at home at the time of the incident.
He said that his wife had told him that she had used the Taser on the girl because she was being disobedient.
He said that he did not know that his wife had a Taser and that he had never seen her use it before.
The girl’s biological mother, who has also not been named, said that she had given her daughter up for adoption because she was unable to care for her.
She said that she had no idea that her daughter was being mistreated by her adoptive parents.

By . Associated Press . Domino's is introducing its own version of Siri. The pizza
","By . Associated Press . Domino's is introducing its own version of Siri. The pizza delivery chain announced on Monday that it is introducing a function on its mobile app that lets customers place orders by speaking with a computer-generated voice named Dom. The rollout is part of an ongoing push by Domino's to take business away from rivals and smaller pizza shops by offering more convenient ways to order. The company, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, says the updated app for iPhones and Android devices will deliver a 'human-like, conversational' experience, but notes that it will take some time to work out the kinks in the technology. Ordering just got easier: Domino's is introducing a 'Siri' app so customers can order on mobiles . 'It is not perfect,' Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle said in an interview. 'This is the sort of thing, like any other really new technology launch, you're going to learn, you're going to get better.' Already, mobile and online ordering accounts for 40 percent of Domino's U.S. sales. Growing that portion of its business has become a priority for the chain, with customers increasingly saying they prefer to place orders that way. People who order digitally also tend to spend more and return with greater frequency because they like the convenience, Doyle said. Meanwhile, he noted that smaller pizza shops don't have the money to invest in such technologies. 'It is clearly an area where we'll be able to leverage our scale,' he said. Customers who order pizza with their smart phones spend more . Although other factors have played a role, Domino's credits its digital platforms for helping drive sales. Last year, the company's domestic sales rose 5.4 percent at established locations.Still, compared with many other cuisines, the pizza industry remains fairly fragmented. Four of the national biggest chains — Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's and Little Caesars — together have a little more than 40 percent of the market, according to Doyle. Darren Tristano, an analyst with the industry tracker Technomic, said the major chains have the potential to grow their market share by leveraging national marketing campaign and the ability to offer steeper discounts. And while sophisticated digital ordering platforms give the big chains an edge, Tristano said those technologies will eventually become cheap enough for smaller players to adopt. 'That gap is shrinking,' Tristano said. For now, the voice ordering function on the Domino's app is fairly simple. After pulling up the app, customers type in their address and are taken to the ordering page where they can push a button to order by voice. A voice that identifies itself as Dom walks customers through the process by asking if they want additional toppings or other items. To pay, customers still have to type in their credit card information. Domino's Pizza Inc., which has 5,000 U.S. locations, is partnering with Nuance Communications to offer the technology.","(558, 26)","Domino's Pizza has been working hard to modernize its business, and it looks like those efforts are paying off. According to a recent report, mobile and online ordering now make up 40 percent of Domino's sales in the United States. This is great news for the pizza giant, which has been investing heavily in technology to keep up with changing consumer habits. With more and more people turning to their smartphones and computers to order food, Domino's has been working to make it as easy as possible for customers to order pizza from anywhere, at any time. But it's not just about making ordering easier for customers. Domino's also sees technology as a way to gain an edge over its smaller competitors, who may not be able to afford the same level of investment in digital ordering platforms. ""We believe technology is a strategic advantage, and we're trying to use it in a way that makes a difference to our customers and to our business,"" said CEO Patrick Doyle in a recent interview with CNBC. One way that Domino's is using technology to gain an edge is by offering a seamless ordering experience across multiple channels. Customers can order via the Domino's mobile app, the company's website, or through third-party delivery services. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for customers to place an order, regardless of how they prefer to order. Another way that Domino's is using technology to improve its business is by leveraging customer data to drive sales. According to the company, people who order digitally tend to spend more than those who order over the phone or in person. By analyzing customer data and trends, Domino's is able to create targeted marketing campaigns that encourage customers to spend more when they order. Of course, not every pizza chain has the resources to invest heavily in technology. This puts smaller competitors at a disadvantage, as they may not be able to offer the same level of convenience and ease of ordering that Domino's can. Doyle sees this as an opportunity for Domino's to gain market share and grow its business. ""There are a lot of concepts out there that don't have the capital or the scale to invest in technology in the way that we are,"" he said. ""We think there's a real chance for us to take share in the market from some of those competitors who don't have the scale and the resources that we do."" Overall, it looks like Domino's investment in technology is paying off. Mobile and online ordering now account for a significant chunk of the company's sales, and the company is well positioned to continue growing its business in the years to come. While smaller competitors may struggle to keep up with Domino's technological prowess, the company is confident that it can use its advantage to gain market share and continue growing in the highly competitive pizza industry.","(555, 21)","By. Associated Press. Domino's is introducing its own version of Siri. The pizza
chain said Wednesday that it's rolling out a voice-activated ordering system
that will allow customers to place an order by speaking into their phones.
Domino's says it's the first major restaurant chain to offer such a service.
Customers will be able to say things like ""I'd like a large pizza with pepperoni
and mushrooms"" or ""I'd like to add a side of breadsticks to my order."" They'll
also be able to track the status of their order using voice commands.
Domino's has been working on the technology for more than a year. The company
says it plans to roll out the service to all of its U.S. stores by the end of
the year. The service will be available on both Android and iOS devices.
Domino's isn't the first company to offer voice-activated ordering. Amazon has
been offering a similar service for years. But Domino's says its system is
easier to use because it doesn't require customers to download a separate app.
Instead, they can just use the Domino's app they already have on their phone.
Domino's also says its system is more accurate than Amazon's because it uses
natural language processing to understand what customers are saying. This means
that customers don't have to speak in a certain way or use specific keywords.
They can just speak naturally and the system will understand them.
Domino's hopes that the new service will help it attract more customers and
increase sales. The company has been struggling in recent years as more people
order pizza online or through delivery services like Grubhub and Uber Eats.
Domino's CEO Ritch Allison said in a statement that the new service is ""a
game-changer"" for the company. He said it will make it easier for customers to
order pizza and will help Domino's compete with smaller chains that don't have
the resources to invest in technology.
The new service is just the latest example of how technology is changing the
way we order food. In recent years, we've seen the rise of apps like Seamless
and Grubhub that allow us to order food from our phones. We've also seen the
rise of delivery services like Uber Eats and Postmates that allow us to get
food delivered to our doorsteps. And now, we're seeing the rise of voice-
activated ordering systems like the one Domino's is introducing.

Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his poor form, according to club
","Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his poor form, according to club legend Ian Rush. The Italian forward has scored just one goal since his £16million summer move from AC Milan, and some supporters have begun to question his worth to the side. But Liverpool's record scorer insisted the 24-year-old has a role to play at the club. Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his slow start at the club, according to legend Ian Rush . 'He still has a future at Liverpool,' Rush told talkSPORT. 'The fans are some of the most patient, but he has to realise he's playing at Liverpool Football Club, not just any other club. 'He's got to show his commitment to the club by proving it on the pitch. 'He's only 24 and he's got to learn he's at ,for me, the best club in the world. You've got to give 100 per cent every time you go out on that pitch. 'You look at Real Madrid last night and you see (Karim) Benzema, you see (James) Rodriguez, you see (Cristiano) Ronaldo all running in behind the defenders - we didn't have that last night. The former Manchester City forward was off the pace against Real Madrid and was substituted at half-time . 'We're most probably quite predictable in the way we play.' The former Manchester City man was also criticised for swapping shirts with Pepe at half time, an action Rush did not condone. He said: 'The Liverpool fans are very knowledgeable, and you just don't do that (swap shirts at half time). 'I'm sure Brendan Rodgers will have a word with him behind closed doors.' Balotelli was also criticised for swapping shirts with Real Madrid's Portuguese defender Pepe at half time . Michael Owen, meanwhile, felt Balotelli's performance against Madrid highlighted just how much the club missed the injured Daniel Sturridge. He tweeted: 'Just highlights how unbelievably good Suarez was and how much Daniel Sturridge is missed. 'I thought Brendan Rodgers spoke well in his post match interview. Doesn't seem happy with Balotelli. Signing him was always a risk. 'If I was Brendan Rodgers I would pay an extra few million and try to get (Divock) Origi to the club 6 months earlier than originally agreed.' Michael Owen said Balotelli's form highlighted  how much Liverpool missed the injured Daniel Sturridge . VIDEO Rodgers laments first-half showing .","(467, 24)","Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli continues to struggle for form and face criticism from fans, with his latest performance against Real Madrid on Wednesday night being one of his worst. The Italian footballer, who joined Liverpool during the summer, has scored just one goal for the club so far, leading to concerns about his future at Anfield. Despite being given a rare opportunity to lead the Liverpool attack against Real Madrid in the absence of Daniel Sturridge and the injured Mario Lambert, Balotelli failed to make any significant impact during the game. In fact, he was so ineffective that he received a zero rating from the Spanish newspaper AS, an embarrassing blow to the striker. Adding further insult to injury, Balotelli was also criticized for swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at halftime during the match. This outraged Liverpool coach Brendan Rodgers, who expressed his disappointment at the incident, suggesting that it reflected poorly on the entire team. However, not everyone is ready to give up on Balotelli just yet. Liverpool legend Ian Rush has come out in defense of the striker, arguing that he still has a future at the club despite his current struggles. According to Rush, Balotelli simply needs more time to adjust to the club and to the Premier League. Balotelli's struggles at Liverpool have been evident from the start, with many fans expressing disappointment in his performances and questioning his commitment to the team. His on-field antics and off-field antics at his previous clubs have also contributed to the negative perception of him. While Liverpool's patience with Balotelli may not have run out just yet, it is clear that the striker must improve his form and attitude quickly in order to avoid being sidelined or even dropped from the squad altogether. If he fails to do so, it may be time for Liverpool to cut their losses and look for alternative options ahead of the January transfer window. Whatever happens, it is clear that Balotelli's future at Liverpool remains uncertain at best. While he may have a special talent on the pitch, his off-field antics and tendency to become distracted by non-football-related matters could make any continued tenure at the club impossible.","(403, 15)","Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his poor form, according to club

at half-time, an incident which Brendan Rodgers described as ""unacceptable"". However,
Rush believes that the 24-year-old still has a lot to offer the club and should be given
a chance to prove himself. ""I think he's still got a future at Liverpool,"" Rush told Sky

League games and been substituted in all but one of his other appearances. Despite
his struggles, Balotelli remains confident that he can turn things around. ""I'm not

A climber has died after plummeting 50 feet from a cliff edge into the sea as his girlfriend watched in horror. The 32-year-old Wiltshire man had been scaling the rocks at a Dorset beauty spot when he lost his footing and fell 40 foot onto a ledge and then into the water. A coastguard helicopter and two lifeboats were deployed to rescue the man, who was described as an experienced climber, from the sea below Dancing Ledge, near Swanage, Dorset. Dancing Ledge near Swanage in Dorset, where a 32-year-old climber died after falling into the sea. Victim not pictured. He was flown to hospital but was pronounced dead just a short while later. His family have been told of the climber’s tragic fall, which happened yesterday afternoon. The man, who was visiting the area on holiday, had been traversing the cliffs at Dancing Ledge, a popular location for climbers on the Jurassic Coast. The beauty spot on the Isle of Purbeck was featured in the BBC’s 2008 adaptation of Thomas Hardy’s novel Tess of the D’Ubervilles which starred Gemma Arterton and Eddie Redmayne. Climbers flock to the picturesque location because it boasts a small 10 metre high cliff close to the sea and a larger 20 metre high limestone cliff set a little way back from the smaller drop. 'On the afternoon of Thursday, August 23 Dorset Police and the coastguard were called to the scene of a climbing accident at Dancing Ledge, near Swanage,' said Inspector Debbie Martin.

The holidaymaker, whose name has not yet been released, was visiting Durdle Door with his girlfriend when the tragic incident occurred.  The couple had been taking in the stunning panoramic views of the Jurassic Coast from the top of the cliff when the man suddenly lost his footing and fell to his death into the ocean below.  Although rescue teams rushed to the scene, tragically the man could not be saved. Dorset Police officers pointed out that this is not the first time such an unfortunate incident has taken place on this spot.  According to officials, the cliff where the man fell from is infamous for inducing some wanderers to take risks that can result in accidents. A spokesperson from Dorset Police made a statement a little while later, urging visitors to take heed of the warnings and barriers in place.

‘A member of the public managed to pull the man from the water and he was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
‘His death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner.’
Durdle Door is a natural limestone arch which forms part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site.
It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Dorset and attracts thousands of visitors every year.
The area is also a popular spot for rock climbers and there have been a number of fatalities in recent years.
In 2009, a 22-year-old man died after falling from the cliffs at nearby Lulworth Cove.
And in 2007, a 21-year-old woman died after falling 100ft from the cliffs at Man O’War Bay, just a few miles from Durdle Door.
In 2006, a 20-year-old man died in a similar incident at Lulworth Cove.

By . Peter Allen . The bodies of five First World War soldiers have been
","By . Peter Allen . The bodies of five First World War soldiers have been found ‘frozen in time’ in a French wood almost 100 years to the day since they were killed. All are believed to have died on September 5th 1914, the day of a ferocious fire fight between the Allies and Germans near Luneville, in eastern France. The find is particularly poignant this week, when millions around the world will focus on the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy. The bodies of five French soldiers from the First World War have been found in a forest near Luneville almost 100 year since they were killed (pictured, French troops attack at Verdun, near to Luneville) The French infantrymen’s skeletons lay undiscovered for all those years, along with their Lebel rifles, wallets, and a figurine of the Virgin Mary. Philippe Sugg and Gerard Louis, two local historical researchers, made the discovery after studying First World War archives and pinpointing digging sites. The men were in a private forest, which remained practically untouched throughout the decades since the fighting. Mr Sugg said: ‘Documents suggest that several dozen soldiers died in the area. They were often very young men who left their families knowing there was a good chance they would never return.’ Among those ‘frozen in time’ is a 27-year-old from the southern town of Perpignan, whose name is on an identification tag. Later this week the Queen will be in France to commemorate 70 years since the D-Day landings happened in Normandy during the Second World War . Scraps of the red trousers which the French still wore at the beginning of the war were also found. Once his descendants have been informed, his body is likely to be exhumed and buried with full military honours, along with his comrades. Despite the passing of the years, France and neighbouring countries are still covered with the bodies of those who died in the First and Second World War. The Queen and other members of the Royal Family will arrive in France on Thursday to honour the sacrifice of such fallen heroes. She will be on Sword Beach on June 6th, D-Day, at a commemorative ceremony also attended by French and American presidents Francois Hollande and Barack Obama.","(420, 16)","The discovery of the bodies of five French soldiers has sent shockwaves through the Northeastern French town of Luneville. The soldiers' remains were found in a nearby wood, next to their rifles, wallets, and a statue of the Virgin Mary. It is believed that they died in a fight almost 100 years ago to the day. Local authorities are working to identify the soldiers and trace their families. The discovery has caused a great deal of reflection on the sacrifice that was made during World War I. The timing of the discovery has also brought back memories of the great losses that France endured during the Great War. The discovery of the soldiers was made by a group of hikers who were exploring the woods. They noticed a mound of earth that looked like it had been recently disturbed. Upon closer inspection, they found the remains of the soldiers. The hikers immediately contacted local authorities, who cordoned off the area and began their investigations. It is unclear at this time how the soldiers died or who they were fighting against. The woods where the remains were found was a site of intense fighting during World War I, with trench lines running through the area. The discovery of the soldiers has also ignited a debate about the use of war memorials and the importance of remembering those who have died in war. Many in Luneville are calling for a memorial to be built in honor of the soldiers who were found in the woods. The mayor of Luneville, Albert Jacquart, has said that the discovery of the soldiers is a reminder that ""war is always a tragedy"" and that it is important to work towards a peaceful future. He has also called on the French government to adequately fund the maintenance of war memorials and to provide support to the families of soldiers who have died in the line of duty. The discovery of the soldiers is a poignant reminder of the cost of war and the sacrifice that was made by so many during World War I. As France prepares to mark the centenary of the end of the war, the discovery of the soldiers will undoubtedly play a key role in the commemorations. It is hoped that their families can be identified and that they can be given the honor and recognition that they deserve.","(427, 19)","By. Peter Allen.

","By . Fiona Macrae . PUBLISHED: . 18:46 EST, 20 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:00 EST, 21 September 2013 . It is the latest mutt-have: A hug in a T-shirt. The snug-fitting Equafleece, which comes in three colours, is said to relax nervous dogs, in the same way that swaddling soothes fractious babies. As stress levels fall, the dogs find it easier to breathe and cope with their fears. Scroll down for video . Tate the Tibetan Terrier wears his calming Equafleece which comes in three colours . By lightly touching the skin from back to belly, it is believed to encourage the release of oxytocin, the ‘cuddle hormone’ credited with creating feelings of calmness and closeness. Tate, a Tibetan terrier, is put in his Equafleece two or three times a week. His owner, Lisa D’Aguiar, of North London, said: ‘He panics if he hears people outside. ‘The T-shirt makes him calmer. His nerves don’t completely go away but he is chilled and he looks adorable in it.’ Another happy customer, Kate Reeves . from Shropshire, said: ‘I cannot believe how incredibly effective the . t-shirt was in calming my very anxious greyhound and how quickly she . changed from a shaking, drooling wreck into a snoozing, relaxed dog. ‘It continued to work brilliantly during fireworks and thunderstorms.’ Animal behaviour specialist Sarah Fisher says the Equafleece can also be used to reassure dogs that are anxious about travelling in a car or nervous of other animals. Matilda the British bulldog sports another variation of the t-shirt which is said to calm nervous dogs . Tate, Molly and Matilda pose in their Equafleeces that come in different sizes, the smallest being for a Chihuahua . Miss Fisher believes the hug-like feel of . the cotton over-rides the brain’s primeval instinct of fight or flight . in terms of trouble. Those with two legs also benefit. She said: ‘The owner feels he has . something proactive to do to help their dog instead of them getting . worked up by whatever is going on.' Miss Fisher, who assesses dogs for . court cases and teaches staff at animal shelters including Battersea . Dogs Home, said that a normal T-shirt should also have a calming effect. However, the Equafleece is a better option as it is doggy-shaped and contains enough stretch to allow pets to move properly. She said: ‘I am not a fan of dressing up dogs but I am a fan of t-shirts for dogs because they are so calming.’ Dog coats and jackets are thought to be less beneficial because they do not completely close over the belly and so fail to make the creature feel like it is being enveloped in a hug. The Equafleece t-shirts start at £13 for a Chihuahua or a small terrier. An XL shirt, for a retriever or a large greyhound costs £19.","(548, 37)","Equafleece: The Miracle T-Shirt for Dogs A new product has hit the market that has dog owners wagging their tails with excitement. The Equafleece, a t-shirt designed specifically for dogs, has been receiving rave reviews from pet owners who swear by its calming benefits.  The Equafleece is available in different sizes and colors, ensuring that dogs of all breeds and sizes can enjoy the benefits of this revolutionary product. But what makes it so special? According to animal experts, the Equafleece has calming properties that can help soothe nervous dogs and make them feel more relaxed. One of the most common uses for the Equafleece is during car journeys. Many dogs can get anxious or nervous during car rides, but the Equafleece can help ease their nerves and make the journey much more enjoyable for everyone involved. It does this by providing a snug fit that makes dogs feel secure and comfortable.  But it’s not just during car rides that the Equafleece comes in handy. Pet owners have reported that it can also help settle dogs around other animals, especially if they are prone to barking or getting agitated in social situations. The snug fit of the Equafleece is said to provide a sense of comfort and security, which helps dogs feel more at ease in these situations. The Equafleece is also said to have benefits for dogs with respiratory problems. Its design is such that it promotes more comfortable breathing in dogs, which can be particularly helpful for brachycephalic breeds (dogs with short noses) who are prone to breathing difficulties.  So, how does the Equafleece work? Experts say that the snug fit of the t-shirt works similarly to the effect of swaddling a baby – it provides a sense of security and comfort that can help calm the nervous system. This effect can be particularly helpful during stressful situations such as thunderstorms or fireworks displays, which can be particularly challenging for some dogs. The Equafleece is made from high-quality materials that are soft and comfortable for dogs to wear. It’s also machine washable, which is particularly convenient for pet owners. The fleece is made to last, ensuring that dogs can enjoy its calming benefits for years to come. Overall, the Equafleece has been receiving enthusiastic praise from pet owners and animal experts alike. It’s a game-changer for dog owners who have struggled with nervous or anxious pooches, and it’s certainly worth considering for any pet owner looking to make their dog’s life as comfortable and stress-free as possible.","(467, 21)","By.

The Equafleece has been hailed as a life-saver for dogs who suffer from separation anxiety and travel sickness.
The t-shirt, which is designed to fit snugly around a dog’s body, is said to calm the animal’s nerves and help it to breathe more easily.
It is also claimed that the fleece can settle dogs when they are around other animals, such as cats, and make car journeys less stressful.
The t-shirt is available in a range of colours and sizes to suit dogs of all shapes and sizes.
It is made from a special material that is designed to wick moisture away from the dog’s skin, keeping it dry and comfortable.
The t-shirt also has a built-in cooling system that helps to regulate the dog’s body temperature, keeping it cool in hot weather and warm in cold weather.
According to the manufacturer, the t-shirt can help to improve a dog’s quality of life by reducing stress and anxiety.
It is also said to help dogs who suffer from respiratory problems, such as asthma, by making it easier for them to breathe.
So far, the t-shirt has been a hit with dog owners, with many reporting that their pets are calmer and happier since they started wearing it.
One owner, who asked not to be named, said: “My dog used to get really anxious when I left the house, but since she started wearing the t-shirt, she’s much calmer.
“She still gets excited when I come home, but she’s not as stressed out as she used to be.”
Another owner, Sarah Smith, said: “I bought the t-shirt for my dog because she suffers from travel sickness.
“Since she started wearing it, she’s much more relaxed in the car and she doesn’t vomit as much.
“I would definitely recommend the t-shirt to other dog owners – it’s a great way to help your pet feel more comfortable and relaxed.”
If you’re thinking of buying a t-shirt for your dog, there are a few things you should keep in mind.
First, make sure you choose the right size – the t-shirt should fit snugly around your dog’s body, but not too tight.
Second, make sure you wash the t-shirt before you put it on your dog – this will help to remove any chemicals or dyes that could irritate your dog’s skin.
Finally, be patient – it may take a few days for your dog to get used to the t-shirt, so don’t give up if they don’t seem to like it at first.","(518, 21)","By . Fiona Macrae . PUBLISHED: . 18:46 EST, 20 September 2013 . | .

(CNN) -- Tourists staying at Ao Phrao (Phrao Bay) on Thailand's island of Koh Samet
","(CNN) -- Tourists staying at Ao Phrao (Phrao Bay) on Thailand's island of Koh Samet have been evacuated as the bay turned black from an oil spill over the weekend. Authorities estimated that around 5,000 liters of crude oil have washed up on the island, having leaked into the ocean from an offshore pipeline belonging to PTT Global Chemical, Thailand's largest petrochemical producer. The total leakage is estimated at 50,000 liters. Due to its beautiful beaches and proximity to Bangkok -- the travel time from the capital is a little less than four hours by bus and then boat -- the island has long been a popular Thai weekend destination.

The picturesque shoreline of Koh Samet island, located off the eastern coast of Thailand, has been turned black due to an oil spill that occurred on Saturday.  Approximately 5,000 liters of oil have washed ashore since the spill, and though cleanup efforts are underway, concerns are growing over the potential impact on the island's ecosystem. Koh Samet is known for its vibrant coral reefs, tropical fish, and crystal-clear waters. The oil spill raises concerns about the possible damage to marine life and the wider ecosystem. The spill occurred on Saturday in the Gulf of Thailand, impacting the pristine sands and waters of Koh Samet's Ao Phrao Beach. The spill was first noticed by local residents and visitors in the early morning hours as black sludge began to infiltrate the shoreline.  Authorities have yet to determine the cause of the oil spill but are urging visitors to steer clear of the affected areas. Tourists and locals alike have been advised to avoid swimming or engaging in water-based activities until the situation is resolved. Environmental groups, including Greenpeace, have voiced their concerns about the potential long-term impact of the spill. ""This spill may be worse than first thought,"" said an opposition MP, citing the potential damage to local marine life and the wider ecosystem of the Gulf of Thailand. Efforts are now underway to contain the spill and prevent further damage to the islands. Cleanup crews have been dispatched to the affected areas, and more are expected to arrive in the coming days. They are using a variety of techniques to clean up the sludge, including the use of specialized equipment, such as skimmers and absorbent pads, to soak up the oil. Despite this, concerns remain that the spill may have already caused irreparable damage. Tourism officials are concerned about the impact on local businesses, as Koh Samet is one of the most popular weekend getaway destinations in Thailand. Local businesses, including hotel owners and dive companies, are already feeling the pinch as vacationers cancel their bookings and steer clear of the affected areas. The long-term impact on the economy of Koh Samet and the surrounding region remains unclear. Authorities are urging visitors to remain vigilant, and to report any further signs of oil washing up on the island's shores. The future of Koh Samet remains uncertain, but officials are hopeful that prompt action and cooperation between authorities, local businesses, and community members can help to minimize the damage caused by this devastating oil spill.  It is a somber reminder that the convenience that oil brings to the economy should always be balanced with the responsible consideration of its impact on the environment.","(506, 21)","(CNN) -- Tourists staying at Ao Phrao (Phrao Bay) on Thailand's island of Koh Samet

remain open have seen a sharp decline in bookings. Local businesses have also been
hard hit, with many reporting a significant drop in sales.
In addition to the economic impact, the spill has also had a negative impact on the
environment. The oil has coated the sand and rocks on the beach, making it difficult
for marine life to survive. The spill has also contaminated the water, making it
unsafe for swimming and other water activities.
The Thai government has launched an investigation into the cause of the spill and
is working to clean up the affected areas. However, the cleanup process is expected
to take several weeks, and the full extent of the damage is still unknown.

a chemical plant in Rayong province released toxic chemicals into the air, forcing
thousands of residents to evacuate their homes.
These incidents highlight the need for stronger environmental regulations and

Your article is well-written and informative, but there are a few areas where you can
improve your writing skills.
Firstly, you should try to use a wider range of vocabulary to make your writing more
interesting and engaging. For example, instead of using the word ""significant"" to
describe the impact of the oil spill, you could use a more descriptive word like
""devastating"" or ""catastrophic."" Similarly, instead of saying that the spill has
""coated"" the sand and rocks, you could say that it has ""covered"" or ""blanketed"" them.
By using more descriptive language, you can make your writing more vivid and
Secondly, you should work on your sentence structure. Your sentences are generally
short and simple, which can make your writing sound repetitive and monotonous. Try
to vary your sentence structure by using longer and more complex sentences. For
example, instead of saying ""Many hotels and resorts on the island were forced to
close their doors,"" you could say ""The oil spill forced many hotels and resorts on
the island to close their doors.""
Finally, you should pay attention to your grammar and punctuation. While your
article is generally well-written, there are a few grammatical errors and
punctuation mistakes that you should correct. For example, you should use commas to
separate items in a list, and you should use apostrophes to indicate possession.
By paying attention to these details, you can improve the overall quality of your
writing and make it more polished and professional.
Overall, your article is a good start, but there is still room for improvement. By
working on your vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar, you can take your
writing to the next level and become a more effective communicator.","(914, 38)","(CNN) -- Tourists staying at Ao Phrao (Phrao Bay) on Thailand's island of Koh Samet

Her tales have enchanted generations of English children and now Beatrix Potter is set to win another fan - baby Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge has decorated his nursery with characters from Beatrix Potter's classic children's book, it has emerged. While Kensington Palace officials are said to have suggested antique furniture as more befitting a future king, Kate had her heart set on a Beatrix Potter theme.

And her mother-in-law Camilla took her side - insisting the nursery should be decorated to Kate's liking. A source told The Sun: 'Camilla has experience in dealing with the ""old grey men"". She put her foot down, saying it should be Kate's choice.' The pair are said to have become very close since Kate became pregnant with her first child George who was born on July 22. The source added that the Duchess loves how Camilla treats George like any grandchild who 'wees, vomits and does everything babies do'.

When it came time to decorate their eldest son's nursery in Kensington Palace, palace officials suggested classic antique pieces to adorn the room. However, the Duchess had a different idea in mind - she wanted to incorporate the beloved characters from Beatrix Potter's renowned children's books into the room. Beatrix Potter was a British author and illustrator known for her beloved children's books. Even though her tales were written over 100 years ago, they remain some of the most popular and cherished books for children of all ages. One of her most beloved stories is ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit"", which follows the adventures of Peter and his sisters Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail. Despite the palace officials' suggestion, the Duchess knew that the charm of Beatrix Potter's tales would be the perfect fit for her son George's nursery. The walls of the room were adorned with whimsical illustrations of the iconic Peter Rabbit and his mischievous adventures in Mr. McGregor's garden. The illustrations were rendered in soft pastel shades and were the perfect complement to the neutral-toned furnishings in the room. The Duchess also incorporated other characters from Beatrix Potter's books into her design, including Jemima Puddle-Duck and Tom Kitten, to name a few. The entire room was filled with references to the beloved literary works, making it a space that was magical and full of wonder. The Duke and Duchess' choice to incorporate the timeless Beatrix Potter characters into their son's nursery speaks to their appreciation for classic literature and the importance of sharing it with their children. They join a long list of parents who have embraced the characters and stories in their own homes, making it a tradition that has spanned generations. As for the antique pieces that were recommended by the palace officials - they were not forgotten. The Duke and Duchess incorporated some of these items into other areas of Kensington Palace, where they added a touch of history and character to their already stunning residence. In conclusion, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's decision to decorate their son's nursery with illustrations from The Tale of Peter Rabbit is a testament to the enduring appeal of Beatrix Potter's literary works. The room exuded a sense of charm and wonder that will no doubt inspire and captivate their children for years to come. Being an example of how classic literature can still hold a special place in everyone's heart even as the years go by.","(480, 18)","By. Suzannah Hills. PUBLISHED:. 06:15 EST, 10 August 2013. |.

A soldier from the Royal Engineers was killed in action in Afghanistan, the Ministry of Defence said. The serviceman was killed yesterday as a result of enemy fire while on operations east of Kabul. His next of kin have been informed and have requested the customary period of grace before further details are released, a spokesman said. The death takes to 447 the number of UK service members who have lost their lives since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001, and is the ninth this year. A British soldier watches an air attack from an Apache helicopter in Afghanistan (file picture) The majority of British forces are in Helmand Province, in the south of the country, but some also operate elsewhere, including in and around the capital, Kabul. The drawdown of British troops is under way, and all combat troops are due to have left by the end of 2014. There are just four bases remaining outside Camp Bastion, due to be closed down one by one in the new year, and the number of personnel has been reduced from 9,000 at the start of the year to around 5,200. A British soldier on standby as a Chinook helicopter brings supplies in Afghanistan (file picture) During a pre-Christmas visit to Helmand last week, David Cameron said Britain had accomplished its mission in Afghanistan. Touring Camp Bastion in what is likely to be his last seasonal meet-and-greet with troops on the ground there, the Prime Minister said: 'To me, the absolute driving part of the mission is a basic level of security so it doesn't become a haven for terror. 'That is the mission, that was the mission and I think we will have accomplished that mission and so our troops can be very proud of what they have done.'","(358, 17)","A total of 447 British service members have been killed in Afghanistan since the start of the war in 2001, according to recent reports. The news comes as the UK's drawdown of troops accelerates, with all forces set to be out of the country by the end of 2014. The number of UK troops in Afghanistan has been decreasing steadily in recent years, as the coalition forces make preparations for the end of their mission. The UK currently has around 9,000 military personnel in Afghanistan, down from a peak of nearly 10,000 in 2012. The UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan comes as part of the coalition's transition to Afghan-led security, which has been in motion since 2011. This process aims to hand over security responsibility to Afghan forces, with the goal of enabling the country to take control of its own affairs. The drawdown of UK forces has not come without sacrifice, however. Of the 447 British service members who have lost their lives in Afghanistan, 404 were killed as a direct result of hostile action. The remaining 43 died from illness, non-combat injuries, or accidents. The UK has been involved in the conflict in Afghanistan since 2001, when a US-led coalition invaded the country in response to the September 11th terrorist attacks. British forces have played a major role in the conflict, contributing to efforts to provide security, reconstruct infrastructure, and support economic development. Despite the sacrifices made by the UK and other coalition forces, many experts believe that the war in Afghanistan has not resulted in a decisive victory. Critics argue that the presence of foreign forces has only served to perpetuate the conflict, and that the war's long-term effects on the region remain uncertain. As the UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan continues, the country will face new challenges in its efforts to promote stability and security both at home and abroad. While the future remains uncertain, the sacrifice of those who have lost their lives in service to their country will not be forgotten.","(373, 15)","By. Ted Thornhill.

Blown away: Shocked Jessica Parsons had to leave a pub when a bouncer thought she had taken cocaine . Pub staff kicked out two women who blew their noses - because they thought they were using cocaine. Nursery worker Jessica Parsons, 23, refused to let the common cold stop her from enjoying a night out with two friends at a pub in Cheam, Surrey. But when she and one of her friends blew their noses in the toilet, they were accused of taking Class A drugs. A female bouncer confronted them when they left their cubicles and ordered them to leave. Shocked Miss Parsons says she will never return to the pub, which she has been visiting since she was 18. The incident happened on Saturday night at the Harrow Inn, where staff have defended their actions. Miss Parsons said: 'It was about half nine and we went to the toilet. Because we both had colds we both blew our noses while we were in there. We weren’t in the same cubicle or anything like that. 'As we left, one of the female bouncers pulled us back and said ""come with us"". 'They said there was a drug problem and that they heard us sniffing drugs in there. 'I told them I blew my nose because I have a cold and laughed because I thought it was a joke - I don’t even smoke, let alone do cocaine! 'We both have respectable jobs and we just wanted to go out for a quiet drink. I work in a school, there is no way I would risk that. 'I asked them to call the police but they wouldn’t and they just told us to leave, so we had to go and leave a bottle of wine we’d just bought on the table.' Miss Parsons said she has been going to the pub regularly since she was 18, but now plans never to return. Not to be sniffed at: Miss Parsons, pictured, said she and her friend had to leave a bottle of wine behind . A manager at the pub, who declined to give his full name asking only to be identified as Sam, said: 'We have a high rate of drugs issues in the area and our place is one of the red alert places. 'We have three door staff who will deal with situations when there is the slightest suspicion. If, in this case, we have made a mistake then it would be the first time. 'We are a lively pub so in terms of security we can’t be too careful.' However, the two women did not let the incident bring their evening to a halt. After being kicked out, they continued the night at All Bar One in nearby Sutton.","(550, 31)","A young woman named Jessica Parsons has recently spoken out against an incident that occurred at the Harrow Inn in Cheam, Surrey. Parsons, who is 23 years old, was out with two friends when they were kicked out of the pub by bouncers. The reason for their expulsion? The bouncers heard Parsons and one of her friends blowing their noses. Parsons was understandably confused and upset by the incident. She told reporters, ""I don't even smoke, let alone do cocaine! We were just blowing our noses because we had a cold."" Despite this explanation, Parsons and her friends were still escorted out of the pub. The manager of the Harrow Inn, who has not been named, defended the bouncers' actions. ""We're a lively pub, so in terms of security we can't be too careful,"" he said in a statement to the press. ""We have to be constantly on the lookout for anyone who may be breaking our rules or causing a disturbance."" This incident has sparked a debate about security in pubs and other public places. While some argue that bouncers and security personnel need to be vigilant to ensure the safety of patrons, others feel that incidents like this are an overreaction and can be harmful to innocent people. Parsons, for her part, has decided not to return to the Harrow Inn. ""I don't feel safe going back there,"" she said. ""If they're going to kick me out for blowing my nose, what else might they do?"" This sentiment has been echoed by many on social media, with some calling for a boycott of the Harrow Inn and other pubs that exhibit similar behavior. Others, however, have defended the pub's right to enforce its own rules and protect its patrons. Regardless of the outcome of this particular incident, it is clear that the issue of security in public places is one that will continue to be debated for some time to come. As society grapples with the ongoing threat of terrorism and other crimes, finding the right balance between security and personal freedom will undoubtedly be a challenge.","(406, 20)","By.

A young woman who was thrown out of a pub for blowing her nose has vowed never to return – because she doesn’t even smoke.
Jessica Parson, 23, had been enjoying a night out with two friends at the Harrow Inn, in Cheam, south-west London, when bouncers overheard her and a friend sneezing and blowing their noses.

She added: ‘I’m not going back to that pub. I don’t want to spend my money in a place where I’m treated like that.’
Miss Parsons, from Sutton, Surrey, had gone to the Harrow Inn with two friends on Saturday night.
She said: ‘We were just having a good time. We weren’t rowdy or anything. We were just having a laugh.
‘We were sitting at the bar and one of my friends started sneezing. Then I started sneezing as well.
‘One of the bouncers came over and asked us what we were doing. We told him we were just sneezing.
‘He told us we had to leave because he thought we were snorting cocaine.’
Miss Parsons said she and her friends were escorted out of the pub by the bouncers.
She added: ‘It was really embarrassing. I felt like I was being treated like a criminal.
‘I don’t know why they thought we were taking drugs. I don’t even smoke.’
Miss Parsons’ friend, who did not want to be named, said: ‘We didn’t do anything wrong. We were just sitting at the bar having a good time.
‘We weren’t causing any trouble. The bouncers shouldn’t have treated us like that.’

‘We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to drugs. If we suspect someone is taking drugs we will ask them to leave.

A young woman who was thrown out of a pub for blowing her nose has vowed never to return – because she doesn’t even smoke.
Jessica Parson, 23, had been enjoying a night out with two friends at the Harrow Inn, in Cheam, south-west London, when bouncers overheard her and a friend sneezing and blowing their noses.
They were then told to leave the pub because they were suspected of taking cocaine.
Miss Parsons, who does not smoke or take drugs, said: ‘I don’t even do cocaine, let alone blow my nose.’
She added: ‘I’m not going back to that pub. I don’t want to spend my money in a place where I’m treated like that.’
Miss Parsons, from Sutton, Surrey, had gone to the Harrow Inn with two friends on Saturday night.
She said: ‘We were just having a good time. We weren’t rowdy or anything. We were just having a laugh.
‘We were sitting at the bar and one of my friends started sneezing. Then I started sneezing as well.
‘One of the bouncers came over and asked us what we were doing. We told him we were just sneezing.
‘He told us we had to leave because he thought we were snorting cocaine.’
Miss Parsons said she and her friends were escorted out of the pub by the bouncers.
She added: ‘It was really embarrassing. I felt like I was being treated like a criminal.
‘I don’t know why they thought we were taking drugs. I don’t even smoke.’
Miss Parsons’ friend, who did not want to be named, said: ‘We didn’t do anything wrong. We were just sitting at the bar having a good time.
‘We weren’t causing any trouble. The bouncers shouldn’t have treated us like that.’
A spokesman for the Harrow Inn said: ‘The Harrow Inn is a lively pub and as such we have to be very careful when it comes to security.
‘We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to drugs. If we suspect someone is taking drugs we will ask them to leave.

Kelly-Ann McMullan-Preiss, 39, was one of a number of parents who didn't want the school dictating when she had to discuss masturbation with her son . Sixth graders at a New York City school no longer have to read a book on their summer reading list after parents objected to its sexual content. Angry parents had 'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' struck off the reading list for 11-year-old kids attending Public School/Middle School 114 in Rockaway Park, Queens because they objected to passages about masturbation. All incoming sixth-graders had been originally expected to write a graded-essay on the book, until outraged parents raised their objections. The award-winning young adult novel, by author Sherman Alexie, is about a Native American boy who transfers into an all-white high school. It includes lines such as: ‘And if God hadn’t wanted us to masturbate, then God wouldn’t have given us thumbs. So I thank God for my thumbs.’ One angry parent said she didn’t want the school dictating when she had to discuss masturbation with her son. ‘It’s about... masturbation - which is not appropriate for my child to learn at 11,’ Kelly-Ann McMullan-Preiss, 39, told the New York Daily News.

Irene Dougherty told the Daily News. ‘It really should be a parent’s decision how much information is given to their children.’ One parent had described 'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' as 'Fifty Shades of Grey' for kids . A Department of Education spokesman said selected texts are school-based decisions. Author Alexie had previously defended the book after it was pulled from an Oregon classroom in 2008. 'Everything in the book is what every kid in that school is dealing with on a daily basis, whether it’s masturbation or racism or sexism or the complications of being human,' he told The Bulletin a the time. 'To pretend that kids aren’t dealing with this on an hour-by-hour basis is a form of denial.' The book won the 2007 National Book Foundation award for Young People's Literature.

A book called ""The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian"" was assigned to 6th-grade students at the school, prompting outrage from parents who felt the content was inappropriate for their children. While the book has been praised for its portrayal of Native American culture and the challenges faced by Indigenous youth, some parents objected to its depictions of sexuality and drug use. One mother likened the book to ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" for kids. The school initially defended its decision to include the book in its curriculum. However, after several parents expressed concerns over having to explain masturbation and other mature themes to their 11-year-olds, the school ultimately decided to remove the book from the curriculum. In a statement, the school acknowledged the concerns of parents while also expressing its commitment to offering a diverse range of literature to its students. ""While we believe that 'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' is an important work of literature that offers valuable insights into the experiences of Indigenous youth, we also understand that some parents may not feel comfortable with its content,"" the statement read. The incident has brought up larger questions about censorship and the role of parents in shaping their children's education. Some educators argue that exposing students to controversial or uncomfortable topics is an important part of their development, prompting them to think critically about the world around them. Others, however, feel that parents should have more control over what their children are exposed to in the classroom. In an interview with local news outlet WCBS, one concerned parent said, ""I think parents should have the right to decide what their children should be reading. That's our job as parents."" The debate over the appropriateness of ""The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian"" serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by educators in creating a curriculum that is both engaging and appropriate for all students. While schools must strive to expose students to a diverse range of perspectives and experiences, they must also be mindful of the concerns of parents and the sensitivities of their students. Ultimately, the decision to include any particular book in a school's curriculum must be a thoughtful and nuanced one, taking into account both the literary merits of the work and the potential impact it may have on students and their families.","(458, 16)","By.

A school in New York has been forced to back down after parents complained about an 11-year-old boy being asked to read a book about masturbation.
Parents objected to their children reading Sherman Alexie's ""The Absolutely True Diary Of A Part-Time Indian"", which includes a scene where the main character masturbates.
One concerned mom likened it to ""Fifty Shades Of Grey"" for kids and said she didn't want to have to explain it to her 11-year-old son.
The school in Queens, N.Y., backed down after receiving complaints from parents who said they didn't want their 11-year-old children to read about masturbation.
The book, written by Sherman Alexie and published in 2007, won the National Book Award for Young People's Literature.
It tells the story of Arnold Spirit Jr., a Native American teenager growing up on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Wellpinit, Washington.
Arnold, who goes by Junior, suffers from hydrocephalus, a condition that causes fluid to build up in the brain.
His mother dies when he is young, and he is raised by his alcoholic father, who abuses him physically and emotionally.
Junior eventually leaves the reservation to attend an all-white high school in Reardan, Washington, where he excels academically and athletically.
Along the way, he deals with issues such as racism, poverty, and alcoholism.
The book has been praised for its honest portrayal of Native American life and its themes of resilience and hope.
However, it has also been criticized for its use of profanity and sexual content, including a scene where Junior masturbates.
Some parents have argued that the book is inappropriate for young readers and that it should not be taught in schools.
Others have defended the book, saying that it is an important work of literature that can help students understand the experiences of Native Americans and other marginalized groups.
The controversy over the book highlights the ongoing debate over what books should be included in school curriculums.
Some argue that schools should focus on teaching traditional subjects like math and science, while others believe that literature and other forms of creative expression are essential for a well-rounded education.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to teach a particular book in school should be based on a careful consideration of its content and its potential impact on students.
In this case, it seems that the school in Queens made the right decision by listening to the concerns of parents and removing the book from the curriculum.
While it is important to expose students to a wide range of ideas and perspectives, it is also important to ensure that they are not exposed to material that is inappropriate or harmful.
By making this decision, the school has shown that it is committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all students.","(537, 23)","By . David Mccormack and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:19 EST, 1 August

Trial: Mark Bridger, the man accused of the murder of April Jones, arrives at Mold Crown Court as the jury retired to consider its verdicts today . A jury has retired to begin its deliberations in the trial of the man accused of murdering April Jones. Mark Bridger, 47, is accused at Mold Crown Court of snatching and murdering the five-year-old in a 'sexually motivated' attack. Bridger, a former slaughterhouse worker from Ceinws, denies abduction, murder and intending to pervert the course of justice. He claims he killed April when he accidentally 'crushed' her with his Land Rover but cannot remember what he did with the body because he was drunk and panicking. Today the jury of nine women and three men was asked to begin its deliberations after a month long trial and were told to take 'all the time they need', the judge told them. In her closing speech to the jury yesterday, Elwen Evans QC, prosecuting, said: 'The evidence overwhelmingly compels the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of each count in this case.' Beginning his address, Brendan Kelly QC, defending, urged the jury to put aside the 'obvious emotions' attached to the case and decide their verdict on the evidence. Claims: Mark Bridger, 47, claims that he hit April Jones, 5, with his car and cannot remember what happened to her body . He said: 'Mark Bridger denies these offences, he denies the inferences which you have been invited to draw, he challenges the 'compelling' evidence which the Crown advances, he says he is not guilty of these offences.' Beginning his summing up, trial judge Mr Justice Griffith Williams gave the jury legal directions and urged them to conduct a 'dispassionate review of the evidence.' April disappeared as she was playing with a friend near their homes on the Bryn-y-Gog estate, Machynlleth, Powys, on October 1 last year. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","(399, 20)","Mark Bridger, who is currently serving a life sentence for the abduction and murder of 5-year-old April Jones in October 2012, has denied the charges brought against him. In his court appearances, Bridger has consistently maintained his innocence, and his latest statement to the court was no exception. Bridger claims that he had never met or had any contact with April Jones, and had nothing to do with her disappearance. The trial, which lasted for four weeks in Mold Crown Court, was highly publicized, and the jury took just over four hours to find Bridger guilty of the charges of abduction, murder, and perverting the course of justice. During the trial, Bridger had tried to explain away his DNA being found on April Jones' clothes by claiming that he must have accidentally brushed against her while walking past her on the street. The court, however, rejected his explanation, saying that it was unlikely that his DNA would have ended up on her clothes in such a way. The police investigation into April Jones' disappearance and her subsequent murder was one of the most extensive in recent British history. It involved over 200 police officers and other experts, and more than 3,000 statements were taken. The case received worldwide media attention, and it touched the hearts of millions of people around the world. The judge in the case, Mr Justice Griffith Williams, said that Bridger's denials were ""utterly without any foundation,"" and that he had shown no remorse for his actions. Bridger was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 35 years. The case of April Jones is a tragic example of the worst sort of crime that can be committed against a child. It is also an example of how the police, the courts, and the media can work together to bring a killer to justice. While Bridger continues to deny his guilt, the fact remains that he was found guilty by a jury of his peers, and justice has been served. April Jones will never be forgotten, and her legacy will live on in the memories of those who loved her.","(400, 15)","By. Martin Robinson. PUBLISHED:. 08:15 EST, 29 May 2013. |.

Martin said he had filed several complaints about what he believed were unsafe practices of the traffic officers on the busy stretch of highway. 'They hide behind signs and they use . their motorcycles sitting in the road, sun going down, without lights or . anything,' Martin, a sign painter, told Fox News. 'I just feel like it was a little bit unsafe, not only for citizens, but for police officers having to do their job.' Texas police said they had spotted Martin holding a sign on the same stretch of road on two other occasions. On the day of Martin's arrest, Officer Thomas Mrozinski wrote in his report: 'I observed a couple cars drive by traveling westbound waving at us.' The officer accused Martin of trying to interfere with speed enforcement. But in court Martin likened himself to the traffic police, saying: 'Ultimately, weâ€™re trying to do the . exact same thing. I just donâ€™t wear a uniform.' Caught: Martin was arrested for standing in the median of this six-lane Frisco road . He added: Iâ€™m the same thing as a speed limit sign, just reminding people that . there is a limit here.' Martin has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor sign for holding a homemade sign. Texas law doesn't ban people from warning drivers of speed traps, but signs can only be held or displayed on private property. '","(414, 28)","Ron Martin, a concerned citizen and retired police officer, is speaking out about a recent decision made by the Texas legislature. In an effort to promote transparency and accountability, the state has allowed citizens to put up signs warning drivers about police presence. However, these signs must be on private property, and Martin worries about the safety of traffic officers who rely on the element of surprise. Martin's concerns stem from his experience as a police officer. He knows that traffic stops can be dangerous for both officers and drivers, and that the element of surprise can sometimes protect both parties. He worries that if drivers become accustomed to seeing warning signs, they may become more aggressive or unpredictable, putting both themselves and police officers in danger. ""I understand the desire for transparency and accountability,"" Martin said in a recent interview. ""But we have to balance that with the safety of our officers. If drivers know exactly where they might encounter a police officer, they may try to avoid that area, or they may be more likely to take risks."" Martin is not alone in his concerns. Many police unions and associations across the country have spoken out against similar signage laws, arguing that they put officers in danger. Some states, like Florida, have even gone so far as to outlaw such signs on public property entirely. Proponents of the Texas law argue that it is an important step towards building trust between law enforcement and the community. They say that by informing citizens about police presence, they can reduce the likelihood of misunderstandings and conflicts. However, Martin worries that the potential benefits are outweighed by the potential costs. He says that ultimately, the safety of police officers has to be the top priority. ""I understand the intention behind the law,"" he said. ""But we have to be careful not to put our officers in harm's way. At the end of the day, their safety is what matters most.""","(377, 19)","By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 09:26 EST, 17 January 2014. |
Ron Martin says he was 'concerned for the safety' of traffic officers
Texas allows warning signs about police but they have to be on private property
A Texas man has been arrested for putting up a sign warning drivers about speed traps in his neighborhood.
Ron Martin, 52, was charged with tampering with a governmental record after he put up a sign that read: 'Speed trap ahead. Beware of cops.'
Martin said he put up the sign because he was concerned about the safety of the traffic officers who work in the area.
He told KTRK-TV: 'I was concerned for their safety. I didn't want them to get hurt. I wanted them to be aware of what was going on around them.'
The sign was placed on a utility pole in front of Martin's home in the Houston suburb of Humble.
Texas law allows people to put up warning signs about speed traps as long as they are on private property.
But Martin's sign was on a utility pole, which is considered public property.
Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Ron Hickman said Martin's sign was illegal because it was on public property.
He said: 'If you're going to put up a sign, put it on your own property. Don't put it on somebody else's property.'
Hickman said Martin could face up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine if he is convicted of tampering with a government record.
Martin said he plans to fight the charges against him.
He told KPRC-TV: 'I don't think I did anything wrong. I don't think I broke any laws.'

Ron Martin said he was 'concerned for the safety' of traffic officers.
The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) issued a warning to motorists that they could face a $200 fine and up to 180 days in jail if they honked their horns or flashed their lights at officers.
Mr Martin, who works as a traffic officer, said he was concerned about the safety of the officers.
He said: 'I'm concerned for their safety. I don't want them to get hurt.
'I don't think it's a good idea to honk your horn or flash your lights at a police officer.
'It's not a good idea. It's not going to help the situation.'
Mr Martin said the warning was posted on the DPS's Facebook page.
He added: 'We're just trying to keep the public safe.
'We want to make sure they're aware of the law.
'If they're going to honk their horn or flash their lights at an officer, they need to be aware that they could get a ticket.'
Texas allows warnings about traffic officers | Daily Mail Online
Texas allows motorists to flash their lights or honk their horns at police officers, but only if they are on private property.
Ron Martin, a traffic officer with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), told the Daily Mail Online that he was ‘concerned about the safety’ of his colleagues.
‘I’m concerned about their safety,’ he said. ‘I don’t want to see them get hurt.’
Mr Martin added that he did not think it was a ‘good idea’ to honk or flash one’s lights at a traffic officer.
‘It’s just not a good thing to do,’ he said, adding that it was ‘not going to help’ the situation.
He also said that the warning had been posted on the TxDOT’s Facebook page, and that the department was trying to ‘keep the public safe’.
‘We’re trying to make sure the public is aware of the laws,’ Mr Martin said.
‘If they’re going to be honking their horn or flashing their lights, they should know that they can get a ticket.’
The warning, which has since been removed from the TxDOT Facebook page, reads: ‘We are aware that some people have been honking their horns and/or flashing their lights at TxDOT officers.
‘This is a violation of the Texas Transportation Code and can result in a fine of up to $200 and/or up to 6 months in jail.
‘Please be aware that TxDOT officers are working hard to keep you and your family safe.
‘Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.’
The TxDOT is responsible for maintaining the state’s roads and highways.
It is not the first time that the department has issued a warning about honking or flashing lights.
In 2012, the department issued a similar warning after a driver was caught on camera honking his horn and flashing his lights at a TxDOT officer.
The driver, who was not identified, was charged with a Class C misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of up to six months in jail and a $2,000 fine.
In a statement, the TxDOT said: ‘TxDOT is committed to the safety of our employees and the motoring public.
We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to ensure that our officers are able to do their jobs safely and effectively.
We appreciate the public’s cooperation and understanding in this matter.’","(698, 33)","By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 09:26 EST, 17 January 2014. |

Spain defender Sergio Ramos is refusing to wallow in the pain of Friday’s 5-1 drubbing
","Spain defender Sergio Ramos is refusing to wallow in the pain of Friday’s 5-1 drubbing by Holland and will use it instead as a motivation for their next game. The world champions cannot afford to lose against Chile at the Maracana on Wednesday and Ramos insists their Dutch horror show will help them. ‘I’m not going to spend another second thinking about that match,’ said the Real Madrid defender, who was given the runaround by Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Casillas pushed hard in training with Reina and De Gea available . Running out of time? Ramos (centre) trains with Costa (left) and Busquets on Saturday . Is that wheelie appropriate? Sergio Ramos appears to take a break from training and ride his bike . ‘This team has experience and has been through bad times. It has been able to come back from setbacks like this. That makes it great.’ One setback was losing against Switzerland in their first game at the 2010 World Cup, a tournament they went on to win. With Chile beating Australia in their first game, the pressure is on Spain again and Fernando Torres accepts there is little room for error. Spanish inquisition: the defending world champions had plenty to ponder after defeat to Holland . Looking forward: Fernando Torres knows Spain can't afford to drop points against Chile on Wednesday . The Chelsea striker said: ‘Your opponents know you have to win. You can’t afford to draw and they’ll try to make the most of any anxiety we might have.’ Ramos dismissed suggestions that Spain were at a disadvantage against Holland because they had been training in the milder south for a match in steamy Salvador. ‘We are training here in good temperatures, in good conditions and with good facilities,’ he said. ‘If we’d won, you wouldn’t be talking about this subject.’ After his howler against Holland on Friday night, calls have grown in Spain for manager Vicentre Del Bosque to drop keeper Iker Casillas. The pair were spotted talking as Spain trained on Saturday and Casillas certainly didn't look happy after Del Bosque walked away (bottom).","(415, 19)","Spain's World Cup campaign got off to a disastrous start as they were thrashed 5-1 by Holland in their opening game on Friday. This defeat follows their loss at the 2010 World Cup, where they lost their first game against Switzerland. The reigning world champions found themselves a goal down within the first ten minutes of the game as Holland's Robin van Persie scored an impressive diving header. The Spanish team, however, managed to equalize soon after with a goal from Xabi Alonso from the penalty spot. Despite the draw, it was Holland who dominated the game, scoring four more goals in the second half. Arjen Robben scored twice and Stefan de Vrij and Wesley Sneijder both added their names to the scoresheet. The heavy defeat has put immense pressure on the Spanish team, who now face a must-win game against Chile on Wednesday. A loss in this game would see them crash out of the competition at the group stage, an unthinkable outcome for a side that had been tipped to go all the way. Fernando Torres, who started the Holland game on the bench, admitted after the match that Spain had been well beaten and that they now had to perform against Chile. ""We have no excuses,"" he said. ""We have a very important game against Chile now that we need to win."" Spain's coach, Vicente del Bosque, also acknowledged that his side had been outplayed by Holland. ""We were not at our best,"" he said. ""We made mistakes that we usually do not make and Holland took advantage of that."" The defeat also raises questions about the future of the Spanish team. Many of the players who helped Spain to win the World Cup in 2010 are now in their thirties, and some have suggested that it may be time to blood some younger players. The Spanish team will have to regroup quickly if they are to avoid an early exit from this year's World Cup. They know they will need to improve their performance if they are to stand a chance against a Chile team who will be looking to capitalize on Spain's poor performance against Holland.","(406, 18)","Spain defender Sergio Ramos is refusing to wallow in the pain of Friday’s 5-1 drubbing

Banksy's latest creation in New York is an open-air gallery featuring two pieces on canvas
","Banksy's latest creation in New York is an open-air gallery featuring two pieces on canvas hanging under the High Line in Chelsea. The pieces appear to be a collaboration between Banksy and Brazilian twins, Os Gemeos. Banksy reportedly paid the owner of the space $50,000 to hang his two paintings under the overpass on West 24th between 10th and 11th Avenues. Under guard: Banksy unveiled his latest artwork in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York as part of 'Better Out Than In' Best behavior: Banksy's guards imposed strict rules on crowds eager to view and photograph the works . It's the latest installment of 'Better Out Than In,' Banksy's month-long 'residency' in New York City. The artist announced the works himself on his website. 'Are you the sort of person who enjoys going to art galleries, but wished they had more gravel in them? Then this temporary exhibition space is for you. Housing just two paintings but also featuring a bench, some carpet and complimentary refreshments. Opens today through Sunday 11am til midnight,' he wrote. Refreshments is probably overstating it a little, unless you're in the market for some yellow liquid, reportedly non-alcoholic white wine, dispensed through a water cooler. Chelsea opening: In an area known for swanky galleries, Banksy offered a water cooler filled with white non-alcoholic wine for attendees . Collaboration: Brit Banksy created the works with Brazilian artist Os Gemeos . The New York Post reports that guards watching over the paintings gave onlookers strict instructions for viewing the works. 'This is a private exhibit. There is zero tolerance. If you act up, we will close the gates and that’s that,' said a guard. Needs more gravel: Banksy's latest unveiling drew large crowds to a make-shift outdoor gallery . Catching a glimpse: The works drew crowds of New Yorkers on Saturday . 'You guys come in  small groups . You get five minutes and then we rotate. Everybody gets a fair chance to go in and see the piece. No alcohol no dogs and if you guys behave yourselves we’ll be good to go,' onlookers were told. According to Gothamist, the space is owned by New York property developer Alf Naman. Banksy has caused quite a stir in the Big Apple, where he's undertaking a month-long self-imposed residency. New Yorkers wake every morning to discover a new work adorning some corner of the city. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said last week that graffiti ruins property and is 'a sign of decay,' but  said the NYPD is not actively searching for the artful artist.","(487, 27)","The world-renowned street artist Banksy has once again managed to captivate his audience with his latest guerrilla art show. This time, the elusive artist has set up an outdoor gallery complete with refreshments and 24-hour security guards. According to reports, Banksy paid the owner of the space a whopping $50,000 to showcase his works there. The location of the exhibit is currently unknown, but rumors suggest that it may be somewhere in the United States. The gallery features a series of Banksy's signature thought-provoking pieces, including a politically charged mural and a sculpture made entirely out of recycled materials. Attendees are allowed to enter the space in groups of 20, with each group being permitted to stay for a limited amount of time before they have to leave. The exhibit has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Some have hailed it as another brilliant Banksy creation, while others have criticized it as a cheap ploy for publicity. Regardless of the criticism, one thing is certain - Banksy's art continues to provoke and inspire. The outdoor gallery comes hot on the heels of the artist's recent controversial decision to shred one of his most iconic pieces - ""Girl With Balloon"" - during a live auction. The artwork was sold for over $1 million, but just as the hammer came down, the painting began to self-destruct, leaving the art world stunned. Banksy's latest exhibition is another reminder of the artist's elusive nature. Despite his immense popularity and influence, no one knows who Banksy really is, adding to the intrigue and fascination that surrounds him. The exhibit has also been a subject of controversy due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Some have criticized the event for encouraging mass gatherings and flouting social distancing guidelines. However, it's worth noting that the gallery is being closely monitored by security guards to ensure that attendees follow proper safety protocols. All in all, Banksy's latest exhibition is another stroke of genius from the elusive artist. Whether you love or hate his work, there's no denying that Banksy continues to push boundaries and challenge the norms of the art world.","(399, 18)","Banksy's latest creation in New York is an open-air gallery featuring two pieces on canvas
Banksy, the world-renowned street artist, has once again left his mark on the streets of New York City. His latest creation, an open-air gallery, has been causing quite a stir among art enthusiasts and passersby alike. The gallery, which features two pieces on canvas, is located in a vacant lot in the heart of the city and is open to the public 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
The first piece, titled ""Girl with Balloon,"" depicts a young girl holding a balloon that appears to be deflating.

Husband charged: Jerry Canfield, 72, is accused of shooting his wife of 37 years, Joann
","Husband charged: Jerry Canfield, 72, is accused of shooting his wife of 37 years, Joann Canfield, in the head at her own request . A 72-year-old Northern California man has been charged with murder for what his attorney says was the mercy killing of his dementia-stricken wife. Jerry ‘JC’ Canfield, of Alameda, was arraigned last week on a murder charge in the shooting death of his wife of 37 years, Joann Canfield. Police say Canfield walked into the Alameda police station October 26 to confess that he killed his 72-year-old wife by shooting her in the head. He allegedly told investigators the two had previously agreed he would end her life if an illness left her in constant pain. Assistant Public Defender Drew Steckler said police found physical evidence at the crime scene that corroborated what Canfield told them, including that he left a dozen red roses at his wife's bedside. Mr Canfield is being held in jail without bail. He is scheduled to appear in court to enter a plea November 14. The couple's neighbors in Alameda have spoken out in Canfield's defense, saying that the couple had been inseparable. 'You know, you've heard of being in love? Well, they were that,' next door neighbor Jose De Dios told ABC 7 News. Scroll down for video . Touching gesture: Joann Canfield was found dead from a gunshot wound in her bed, flanked by a dozen red roses left there by her husband . Another neighbor, Bridget Milet, also confirmed that the couple were as close as two people can possibly be. ‘Whenever I'd see them, it restored my faith in married people,’ Milet told KTVU. ‘They just loved each other.’ The 72-year-old woman had developed dementia and her condition was rapidly deteriorating. De Dios said Jerry Canfield once told him that his wife was seeing little demons that were chasing her around the house, causing her to trip and fall often. A month ago, Mr Canfield was forced to put her in a nursing home, but his neighbor said he would spend every waking moment by her side. Memorial: Neighbors have been bringing flowers and other mementos to the Canfields' apartment in Alameda . On October 25, a day before the shooting, the husband brought Joann Canfield back home. Local residents recalled seeing the woman looking disoriented and unable to recognize anyone. The following day, the 72-year-old man placed a bouquet of roses next to his wife's bed and shot her in the head to end her pain, as the two had agreed in advance, according to an affidavit. Canfield then dressed up and drove down to the Alameda police station, where he told an officer that he wanted to make a confession.","(516, 23)","Jerry Canfield, a 72-year-old man from Alameda, California, has been charged with murder for the shooting death of his wife of 37 years, Joann Canfield. The incident took place on October 26th, when Mr. Canfield allegedly shot his wife in the head in what his attorney is calling a ""mercy killing"". According to reports, Mr. Canfield confessed to the killing shortly after it occurred, telling police that he had promised his wife that he would end her pain if it became unbearable for her. It is unclear what type of pain Mrs. Canfield was suffering from, though reports indicate that she had been in poor health for some time. The murder has sent shockwaves throughout the community, with many residents expressing disbelief that such a tragedy could occur in their peaceful town. Some have called for stricter gun laws, while others are calling for more support for those who are caring for loved ones who are sick or in pain. Mr. Canfield's attorney, John Smith, has released a statement on behalf of his client, expressing regret for the incident but also defending his actions. ""Jerry Canfield loved his wife deeply, and he could not bear to see her suffering any longer,"" the statement reads. ""He made a promise to her that he would end her pain if it became too much for her to bear, and unfortunately he had to fulfill that promise."" Despite the defense's arguments, local law enforcement officials have emphasized that the shooting was a clear violation of the law, and that Mr. Canfield will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. ""No one is above the law, and we will not tolerate this kind of violence in our community,"" said Alameda Police Chief Mark Nisleit. The Canfields were known by many in the community as a loving and devoted couple, with friends describing them as ""an inspiration to us all"". They were active in local causes and were often seen at community events, and their loss has been deeply felt by many. While the investigation into the murder is ongoing, many are left wondering how such a tragic event could occur. Some are calling for greater awareness of the mental and emotional tolls of caregiving, while others are questioning the adequacy of support services for those who are struggling with end-of-life issues. Despite the tragedy, many in the community are coming together to support each other in the wake of this loss. Vigils have been held in memory of Joann Canfield, and local authorities are encouraging anyone who may need support to seek it out. ""We are here for you,"" said Chief Nisleit. ""We will do everything we can to support those who have been affected by this tragedy.""","(517, 19)","Husband charged: Jerry Canfield, 72, is accused of shooting his wife of 37 years, Joann

One in five men in Britain die from a heart attack compared to just one
","One in five men in Britain die from a heart attack compared to just one in seven women . By . Sophie Borland . UPDATED: . 05:39 EST, 12 August 2011 . Around one in five men in Britain die from a heart attack, compared to just one in seven women . The sex hormone oestrogen protects women from heart attacks and may explain why they are far less likely to be struck down than men, claim scientists. They have discovered that this naturally-occurring chemical helps stop blood cells sticking to the walls of arteries and forming potentially fatal blockages. Researchers from Queen Mary at the University of London think their findings  may explain why women are far more likely to suffer heart attacks after the menopause, when their oestrogen levels decline. Around one in five men in Britain die from a heart attack, compared to just one in seven women. But while very few women suffer heart attacks before their 50s, the risk suddenly increases after the menopause when they are just as likely to be struck down than men. Until recently experts have struggled to explain why younger women are less likely to develop heart disease and suffer heart attacks. Now research published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology claims that the hormone oestrogen may protect them. But experts say their findings do not necessarily mean that oestrogen could  ever be used in drugs to prevent heart disease. The hormone is known to increase the risk of certain types of cancer. Dr Suchita Nadkarni from the William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary,  University of London, who led the research, said: 'We’ve shown a clear relationship between oestrogen levels and the behaviour of these white blood cells. Researchers from Queen Mary at the University of London, pictured, think their findings may explain why women are far more likely to suffer heart attacks after the menopause, when their oestrogen levels decline . 'Our results suggest that oestrogen helps maintain the delicate balance between fighting infections, and protecting arteries from damage that can lead to cardiovascular disease. 'Understanding how the body fights heart disease naturally is vital for  developing new treatments.' Professor Jeremy Pearson, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart  Foundation said: 'We know that women’s health is partly protected by oestrogen. After menopause  – when oestrogen levels drop dramatically – coronary heart disease rates rise  steeply. It’s not yet clear quite how this protection occurs. 'This study suggests that oestrogen has another role. The hormone seems to  affect women’s response to infection and injury, by preventing white blood  cells from moving out of the blood stream into tissues. This reduces  inflammation, part of the immune system’s rapid response.'","(502, 25)","A recent study has found that the male sex hormone, testosterone, may play a crucial role in preventing artery blockages and reducing the likelihood of heart attacks in men. According to statistics, one in five men in Britain die from a heart attack, compared to just one in seven women. This makes heart disease the leading cause of death among men in the country. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, examined the role of testosterone in preventing blood cells from sticking to artery walls and forming blockages, which can lead to heart attacks. The researchers found that testosterone helps to regulate the production of a protein called PCSK9, which is known to play a key role in the buildup of plaque in the arteries. The study's lead author, Dr. Dobromir Dobrev, explained that ""the findings suggest that testosterone may help to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of heart disease and heart attacks in men."" The research team conducted experiments on mice that were genetically engineered to lack the Pcsk9 gene. They found that the mice had lower levels of plaque buildup in their arteries compared to normal mice. The researchers then injected the mice with testosterone and found that it further reduced plaque buildup in the arteries. Dr. Dobrev acknowledged that more research is needed to fully understand the implications of the findings. However, he expressed that the study provides new insights into the role of testosterone in cardiovascular health, especially for men who are at increased risk of heart disease. Heart disease is a major public health concern in the UK, with over 7.4 million people living with the condition. Men are more likely to develop heart disease at a younger age than women, and research has shown that testosterone levels may have a significant impact on heart health. The new findings are likely to lead to further research exploring the potential benefits of testosterone replacement therapy in men with low testosterone levels. This treatment is already used to improve symptoms of low testosterone, such as reduced sex drive, but it remains a controversial topic in terms of its effects on cardiovascular health. In conclusion, the latest research provides valuable insights into the role of testosterone in preventing artery blockages and reducing the risk of heart disease in men. While more research is needed to fully understand the implications of the findings, the study highlights the importance of testosterone regulation in cardiovascular health, especially for men who are at increased risk of heart attack. The new findings may pave the way for further research into testosterone replacement therapy, which could improve heart health outcomes in men with low testosterone levels.","(488, 18)","One in five men in Britain die from a heart attack compared to just one

","(CNN) -- Burned rubble near a Bali travel guidebook. Twisted metal beside brightly-colored suitcases. Headphones and human remains. In the rural area of eastern Ukraine where a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 fell from the sky on Thursday, the ground was scarred with death and devastation left behind by a flight that never reached its destination. Video footage from the site, located about 30 miles from the Russian border, showed smoke billowing from the smoldering wreckage long after the crash. ""It's a gruesome scene,"" freelance journalist Noah Sneider said. ""There's bodies splayed out through the fields. People said the plane kind of exploded in the air, and everything rained down in bits and pieces, the plane itself, the people inside."" Stunned rescue workers and rebel fighters combed the area, Sneider said, planting sticks with white cotton ribbons where they found bodies in the fields. There are so many dead that it's unlikely the local morgue will be able to hold them all, Sneider said, even in a volatile region that's seen waves of death recently amid clashes between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists. ""When there was the battle for the Donetsk airport, something like 50 people died and they didn't have the space,"" Sneider told CNN's Anderson Cooper. On this flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, officials say there were 298 people aboard. In the wide fields of tall grasses, debris stretched so far, in so many small pieces, that it seemed unfathomable that anyone would ever know for certain what happened to Flight 17, Sneider said. ""Finding things like passports,"" he said, ""is a matter of chance."" Separatists clearly controlled the site, Sneider said. But even battle-hardened rebel fighters appeared shocked, he said. Fighting has torn apart the region. But this is something else. ""Nothing of this scale has happened,"" said Sneider, who's been covering the conflict for months. Locals in the rural area trying to help were overwhelmed, he said. Firemen who rushed to put out the flames found they had a hose with holes in it, spraying water everywhere, he said. As night fell, search crews seemed uncertain about what to do at first, he said. But eventually, teams put up tents and set up flood lights in the field. Ukrainian officials said rescue and investigation teams had been hampered by armed groups in the area. Pictures suggested the area was hardly a cordoned off crime scene, with people standing on top of parts of the wrecked aircraft. And there are some reports that pieces of the aircraft have been looted and put in people's yards, CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Kiev. Sneider said he hadn't seen any looting by people in the area. ""Most of them are so frightened that they're not coming anywhere near here,"" he said.","(549, 28)","Tragedy struck on the outskirts of the war-torn city of Donetsk on Sunday evening, as a passenger plane crash-landed amidst ongoing violence in the region. The crash site is a harrowing scene of devastation, as charred debris fills a wide field with tall grass. Journalist Noah Sneider has described it as a ""gruesome scene"" and even battle-hardened Ukrainian rebels seem shaken by the severity of the crash. The plane, a Boeing 747, was traveling from Bangkok to Amsterdam with over 300 passengers and crew members on board. It crashed just outside Donetsk, a key city in the ongoing conflict between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists. The cause of the crash is not yet known, but the ongoing violence in the region undoubtedly played a role. This catastrophe is yet another reminder of the deepening crisis in Ukraine, where violence has escalated in recent weeks. The city of Donetsk, which has become a battleground between government and rebel forces, has been hit hard by the fighting, leaving many residents in a state of constant fear. The crash has brought a new level of horror to the already dire situation. Journalists and local residents alike are struggling to come to terms with the scale of the tragedy. Speaking to reporters, one local resident said: ""I can't believe this is happening in my city. We've been through so much already and now this."" Emergency services are working to recover the bodies of the victims, but the process is slow and dangerous due to ongoing fighting in the area. Rebel forces have reportedly prevented Ukrainian officials from gaining access to the crash site, adding to the tension in the region. As the investigation into the cause of the crash continues, questions are being raised about the safety of air travel in the conflict zone. Many airlines have already canceled flights to and from Ukraine, citing concerns over safety. The crash is a tragic reminder of the toll that the ongoing conflict is taking on the people of Ukraine. The country has been in turmoil since the ousting of former President Viktor Yanukovych in February, and the situation has only deteriorated since then. More than 3,000 people have been killed and nearly one million have been displaced since the conflict began. International leaders have condemned the violence and called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, but so far, their efforts have yielded little progress. The crash of Flight 747 is a stark reminder of the need for immediate action to end the conflict and restore stability to the region. As the world mourns the loss of those on board Flight 747, the crisis in Ukraine continues to deepen. The crash is a stark reminder that the people of Ukraine are caught in the middle of a bloody conflict that shows no signs of abating. The world must come together to find a way to bring an end to this tragedy and ensure that such a catastrophe does not happen again.","(547, 24)","(CNN) -- Burned rubble near a Bali travel guidebook.

This is a well-written news article that meets the requirements of the assignment. The article provides
detailed information about the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, including the location of the crash
site, the condition of the wreckage, and the reaction of the rebels who control the area. The article also
includes quotes from a journalist who was at the crash site, which helps to add credibility to the report.
However, there are a few areas where the article could be improved. For example, the article does not
provide any information about the cause of the crash or the number of people who were on board the
plane. Additionally, the article could include more background information about the conflict in eastern
Ukraine and the role of the rebels in the region.

Manchester United are planning to play in a series of money-spinning friendlies across the world
","Manchester United are planning to play in a series of money-spinning friendlies across the world should they fail to qualify for Europe. The club is braced for a whopping £20million shortfall if they miss out on the Champions League for the first time in 19 years. And if David Moyes - who has had a disastrous first season at the Old Trafford helm - fails to steer the club into the Europa League, the club are set to miss out on a further £5m. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David Moyes react to the defeat to Olympiacos . Painful viewing: David Moyes has endured a terrible start to life at the Old Trafford helm, with his tenure reaching a nadir with a 2-0 defeat to Olympiacos in the Champions League . Down in the dumps: Nemanja Vidic, Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Robin van Persie and Tom Cleverley lookj dumbfounded during defeat in Greece . And the Old Trafford hierarchy will use globe-trotting, glamour friendlies to fill weeks previously dedicated to European nights to make up the shortfall. With the club set to rake in more than £12m from a five-game tour of the USA in summer, there is money to be made in developing markets such as the Middle East, America and India. And with fellow giants AC Milan, PSV Eindhoven, Valencia and Lyon also struggling in their domestic leagues, Wayne Rooney - who recently signed a £300,000-a-week deal - and Co could yet be set for regular trips abroad. In January 2008, United banked £2m when . playing in Saudi Arabia for Sami al-Jaber's testimonial and they . recently rejected the chance to play a lucrative friendly in Dubai . during their warm-weather break. Future opponents? AC Milan lie ninth in Serie A and are 1-0 down to Atletico Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League . Halcyon days: United won the Champions LEague six years ago but are facing missing out on the competition for the first time in 19 years . The current Premier League champions currently lie sixth - a daunting 11 points off fourth place with 11 games to play. United slumped to a miserable 2-0 defeat in the Champions League last 16 by Olympiacos - the lowest ranked side in the competition. Yet despite the contingency plan, Moyes has been told by Old Trafford chiefs  that qualification for the Europa League is a priority to boost the club's profile among its 650m global fanbase. Money-spinning: Manchester United toured Thailand in the pre-season - and they could return to Asia . Developing market: Shinji Kagawa applauds fans during a friendly at Yokohama last summer .","(473, 21)","Manchester United is reportedly planning a series of high-profile, big-money friendlies around the world in the likely event of missing out on European qualification. The club stands to lose a whopping £20m if they fail to make it to the Champions League next season, a major hit that the team's top brass is preemptively trying to counteract with an aggressive global outreach. The plan, according to sources close to the club, is to organize exhibition matches in various parts of the world, aimed at boosting the club's global brand and attracting new fans. The United hierarchy believes that there is significant untapped potential in several key markets, including the Middle East, America, and India. Manchester United has long been one of the world's most popular and successful football clubs, with a global fan base that extends far beyond its home country of England. However, despite the team's longstanding popularity, there is still more work to be done in terms of reaching new fans and building the club's brand in developing markets. One potential avenue for growth that the club is reportedly exploring is the Middle East, where high-profile soccer exhibitions featuring top European teams have proven highly successful in the past. Manchester United was paid a reported £2m for playing a friendly in Saudi Arabia back in January 2008, an early indication of the financial potential of regionally-targeted exhibition matches. Another market that the club is keen to explore is America, where soccer's popularity has been steadily growing in recent years. Manchester United has made several trips to the United States in the past, playing in major cities like New York and Chicago in exhibition matches that drew large crowds and generated significant buzz. India, with its massive population and burgeoning middle class, is also seen as a potential growth market for Manchester United. While football has yet to achieve the same level of popularity in India as it has in other parts of the world, the country's growing youth soccer scene and increasing fan interest make it a potentially lucrative terrain for the club to explore. Of course, while the potential financial benefits of these exhibition matches are significant, there are certainly risks involved as well. Organizing such extensive tours involves significant travel and logistical challenges, and there is always the possibility that the team could suffer injuries or other setbacks during the matches themselves. Nevertheless, for Manchester United, the benefits of a successful global outreach program far outweigh the potential risks. With £20m at stake in terms of lost Champions League revenue, the club's top executives are doubling down on their efforts to reach new fans and build their brand around the world. Expect to see Manchester United playing exhibition matches in some surprising new markets in the years to come - win or lose in Europe.","(518, 17)","Manchester United are planning to play in a series of money-spinning friendlies across the world

(CNN) -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson signaled his intention to stay at the English
","(CNN) -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson signaled his intention to stay at the English Premier League champions for at least three more years but struggling Blackburn wrecked his 70th birthday celebrations with a stunning 3-2 win at Old Trafford Saturday. Ferguson marked 25 years in charge of the English Premier League champions earlier this year, but his ambition clearly still burns bright. ""I think I've got three years at the club,"" Ferguson told the official club website. ""As long as my health stays up, and as long as I'm still enjoying it and still getting the satisfaction of the team doing its best,"" he added. Ferguson's top moments in 25 years in charge . The legendary Scot has set his sights on further success in the European Champions League after their shock exit at the group stages this season and to add to the club's tally of 19 English championships. ""We have to continue the dominance of winning leagues and, without question, winning a European Cup is important at this club. We should have been in at least another three finals. But you can't be greedy, I suppose, and having won two in my time is an achievement. ""They were special, it was terrific to win them. I think I'd be very keen to do that (again).""

With Ferguson resting Wayne Rooney and other first team regulars, their Lancastrian neighbors led 1-0 at half time through an Ayegbeni Yakubu penalty.

Yakubu rifled home a super second, his 12th of the season just after the break, holding off Phil Jones and Michael Carrick before putting his side 2-0 ahead. Almost immediately, Berbatov atoned for his earlier mistake by pulling one back and when the Bulgarian equalized with his sixth goal in three games, United looked set to claim victory. But Kean's men were resolute throughout and in the 80th minute grabbed the winner. It came after United goalkeeper David de Gea flapped at a Morten Gamst Pedersen corner and Grant Hanley was on hand to head home. The result lifted Blackburn off the bottom, while United stayed level on points with neighbors Manchester City, who play Sunday against Sunderland. Ferguson did not temper his reaction to the disappointing defeat which prevented his side leading the EPL at the end of the year. ""It is a disaster,"" he told Press Association.

""I still feel young and energetic,"" he said. ""I enjoy the job, and I love seeing the team succeed. As long as I'm still capable of doing it, I'll continue to do it."" Ferguson's announcement comes at a time when Manchester United are level on points with arch-rivals Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table. The shock defeat to Blackburn, which came on the back of six consecutive wins for United, has put added pressure on the team to perform in the coming weeks. Despite the setback, Ferguson remains optimistic about his team's chances in the league this season. ""We've got a strong squad,"" he said. ""We've got some great players who are determined to win.

(CNN) -- Jacqueline Woodson's big win at the National Book Awards on Wednesday was briefly
","(CNN) -- Jacqueline Woodson's big win at the National Book Awards on Wednesday was briefly eclipsed by a racially charged joke. After Woodson accepted an award for her memoir ""Brown Girl Dreaming,"" host Daniel Handler shared an anecdote he learned over the summer: that Woodson, who is black, is allergic to watermelon. ""Just let that sink in your mind,"" said Handler, who writes popular children's books under the pen name Lemony Snicket. The non sequitur elicited a few laughs and uncomfortable titters from the audience. Handler went on to say that he advised Woodson to write a book that featured a black girl with a watermelon allergy. Watermelon is historically evoked as a favorite food among black people in racist jokes, and it's considered by many to be an offensive reference. Handler said that Woodson, who won the National Book Award for Young People's Literature, told him he should write the book instead. ""I'm only writing a book about a black girl who is allergic to watermelon if I get a blurb from you, Cornell West, Toni Morrison, and Barack Obama saying this guy's OK,"" Handler said, with a laugh. After a clip from the awards ceremony was posed on C-SPAN, viewers and some prominent writers quickly took to Twitter to denounce Handler's comments as racist and a distraction from Woodson's accomplishment. Handler responded with several apologetic tweets, including: ""My remarks on Wednesday night at #NBAwards were monstrously inappropriate and yes, racist."" Handler also pledged to donate $10,000 to the We Need Diverse Books campaign and match others' donations for 24 hours up to $100,000. Woodson's post-ceremony social media posts have expressed her happiness about the award and have not mentioned Handler's joke. The author did not respond to a request for comment on the incident. Other 2014 National Book Award winners included: . Fiction: Phil Klay, ""Redeployment"" Nonfiction: Evan Osnos, ""Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China"" Poetry: Louise Gluck, ""Faithful and Virtuous Night""","(401, 15)","Jacqueline Woodson, the esteemed author of the memoir ""Brown Girl Dreaming,"" has been awarded the prestigious National Book Award for her work. However, the spotlight was soon stolen from her during the ceremony when ""Lemony Snicket"" author Daniel Handler made a controversial comment. During his presentation to Woodson, Handler recounted a story about a disagreement the pair had years ago about writing. In it, he requested that Woodson consider writing a story about a black girl who is allergic to watermelon. The comment was met with silence among the audience, and many quick to denounce it as both inappropriate and racist. The joke's offensiveness was not lost on Woodson, who addressed the comment afterwards in an interview. She expressed disappointment in Handler's lack of judgement, stating, ""It was so stunning, there was sort of a space of time where I didn’t say anything. I just looked at him, and he looked at me. I said nothing. I mean, really? To come up with that just felt like a slap in the face to me and to so many people."" Handler later apologized multiple times on Twitter for his words, stating, ""My apologies to @JackieWoodson - I am sorry for my flippant comment."" Woodson graciously accepted his apology, saying she ""appreciated his willingness to take full responsibility for the offense."" But for many, the incident highlighted the difficulties and prejudices still present in the literary world. As author Roxane Gay expressed on Twitter, ""What a painful metaphor for @JackieWoodson to experience. We cannot help the baggage others attach to our bodies."" Despite the unfortunate incident, Woodson's award win remained a much-deserved celebration of her talent and her memoir, which explores her experiences growing up in the 60s and 70s as a black child in America. The National Book Award committee praised the book as a ""profound work of art"" and a reflection of Woodson's ""unabashed curiosity about human nature.""","(380, 18)","(CNN) -- Jacqueline Woodson's big win at the National Book Awards on Wednesday was briefly

A grief-stricken couple have been banned from installing a plaque in memory of their daughter
","A grief-stricken couple have been banned from installing a plaque in memory of their daughter - after a council said such tributes were 'too depressing' to read. Tony and Julie Fuller, of Sunbury in Surrey planted a tree in Cedars Park after their only daughter Samantha died on Christmas Eve, aged 28. They wanted to place a plaque with the tree but were left devastated after being told that Spelthorne Borough Council will no longer permit memorial plaques - because 'lots' of people had complained that they were depressing. Tony and Julie Fuller have planted a tree in Cedars Park, pictured, after their only daughter Samantha died on Christmas Eve, aged 28. But the local council has barred them from putting up a memorial plaque . Mr Fuller said: ‘Sam was our only daughter. She meant the world to me and she probably meant more to her mother. ‘You can’t even describe the idea of losing a child. You have to love them completely and make sure you hug them every day. ‘I rang to ask if we could have a tree and how we could go about it. ‘But we were told we couldn’t have a plaque as the council is no longer allowing them. 'I can’t see the harm in it, considering all the other plaques there are on trees and benches. 'I just don’t believe it. I don’t believe people can be so unhappy at seeing memorials. Samantha had contracted Wegener’s granulomatosis, a condition where the immune system attacks itself. The family wanted to create a lasting memory to her. But Jackie Taylor, head of Streetscene at the council, said: 'As a result of lots of complaints that we had, we decided we would stop allowing memorial plaques to remember people. 'At the end of the day our parks and open spaces are to be used by everybody and people don’t like that around every bench or tree there was another plaque remembering somebody who died. 'We don’t have an issue with somebody planting a tree but it doesn’t have to be there with a plaque. 'The trees are there for the people to remember for themselves and we have done the same now with memorial plaques on benches.'","(430, 20)","Sunbury, Surrey - The Spelthorne Borough Council has rejected the bid made by Tony and Julie Fuller for a memorial plaque in memory of their late daughter, Samantha. The council refused the request, stating that memorial plaques tend to be too depressing for people to read. Samantha, who was only 28 years old, passed away due to an immune system illness. Her parents decided to plant a tree in Cedars Park in memory of their daughter. As a tribute to Samantha, the Fullers also wanted to put up a memorial plaque in the same area. However, their request was turned down by the council. The Fullers were devastated by the decision and expressed their disappointment with the council's lack of empathy. In an interview with local reporters, Julie Fuller said, ""We were shocked and heartbroken when we heard the news. We just want to honor our daughter's memory and give something back to the community. It's a shame the council didn't see it that way."" Many people from the community have come forward to express their support for the Fullers. They believe that the council's decision was unfair and insensitive. The Fullers had hoped to put up a memorial plaque in a peaceful spot, which would help them remember their daughter and create a space for others to reflect and think. A spokesperson for Spelthorne Borough Council defended the decision by saying that it was made in the best interest of the public. The council believes that memorial plaques tend to be too upsetting for people visiting the park and that they would prefer a more positive outlook. While many people agree that Cedars Park is a serene spot, there are those who believe that the council is missing an opportunity to show empathy to grieving families in the area. The Fullers and the community have called for the council to reconsider their decision and think of ways to support families who are dealing with loss. In conclusion, the Fullers' request for a memorial plaque in memory of their daughter has been turned down by the Spelthorne Borough Council. While the council cites reasons for their decision, many residents and the Fullers believe that the council has missed an opportunity to show empathy towards grieving families. The Fullers will continue to honor their daughter's memory through the tree they planted in Cedars Park.","(435, 20)","A grief-stricken couple have been banned from installing a plaque in memory of their daughter
Tony and Julie Fuller were devastated when their 28-year-old daughter Samantha died of an immune system illness in 2015.

She added: ""Samantha was such a lovely girl. She was always smiling and laughing. She loved life.""
The couple said they were shocked when they received a letter from the council saying their request had been turned down.
Mrs Fuller said: ""I couldn't believe it when I read the letter. It said the plaque would be too depressing for people to read.""
Mr Fuller said: ""We just want to be able to remember our daughter. We don't understand why the council won't let us do that.""
A council spokesman said: ""Memorial plaques are not permitted in any of our parks and open spaces.
""This is due to the fact that we receive many requests for memorial plaques, which would result in a large number of plaques being placed in the parks and open spaces across the borough.
""This would detract from the enjoyment of the park and open spaces for all users, as well as making them appear cluttered and untidy.""
The spokesman added: ""We appreciate that this is a difficult time for Mr and Mrs Fuller, but we hope they will understand that we have to consider the needs of all park and open space users when making decisions about the placement of memorial plaques.""
The couple have now launched a petition calling on the council to change its policy on memorial plaques.
So far, more than 1,000 people have signed the petition, which says: ""We believe that everyone should have the right to remember their loved ones in a way that is meaningful to them.

","By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 18:40 EST, 7 March 2012 . A young mother and her partner have been arrested on suspicion of murdering her four-year-old son. The child died of a head wound after being found unconscious at his home in the Holbrooks area of Coventry in the early hours of Saturday morning. He was rushed to Coventry's University Hospital but died several hours later. Tragedy: A man and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of murdering a . four-year-old boy after he was found dead in this home in Coventry . A West Midlands force spokesman said the man, 32, and woman, 26, remain in custody today after being arrested yesterday. A spokesman for Coventry City Council confirmed that the child was known the authority's social services department. A forensic post-mortem examination which took place yesterday revealed that he died as a result of a head injury. A police statement said the suspects 'remain in custody this afternoon, where they continue to help police with their inquiries. Search: Forensics officers enter the house in the Holbrooks area of the city . 'Detectives from the force’s public protection unit are working closely with the local authority as the investigation progresses and support is being offered to the boy’s family.' Neighbour Sampson Assafuah, 41, said: 'My wife knew the woman quite well. 'We didn't know the father and they tended to keep themselves to themselves. 'They always seemed like nice enough people. We are very shocked at what has happened. 'The police have been outside the house for three days and we've only just found out why. It's a tragedy.' Scene: Children's toys are scattered around the garden of the house. Neighbours said the boy's parents were believed to be Polish and had three children including a baby born late last year . Neighbours said the boy's parents were believed to be Polish and had three children including a baby born late last year. Two of the children are believed to have attended the nearby Holbrooks Primary School, and were walked to school every day by their mother who a neighbour said was called 'Magda'. The victim is likely to be named later after next of kin have been informed. Detectives from the force's Public Protection Unit are working closely with the local authority as the investigation progresses and support is being offered to the boy's family. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","(461, 28)","A family has recently been in the news after it was reported that they were known to social services. This has sparked concern among local council officials who are responsible for safeguarding vulnerable children. According to sources close to the council, the family had been under their radar for some time. However, despite multiple interventions, including regular visits from social workers, the situation had not improved. As a result, the family's circumstances had come to the attention of the media and were widely reported. The council has defended its handling of the situation, stating that they did everything within their power to keep the family safe. They say that the family's difficult circumstances, which included poverty, addiction, and mental health issues, made it challenging to provide the necessary support. Many people in the community are concerned about what this case could mean for the wider issue of child protection. Some argue that the council should have done more to intervene and protect the children, while others sympathize with the difficult decisions that social workers must make. Dr. Sarah Wood, a child protection expert, believes that the case highlights the need for better training and support for social workers. ""Cases like this are incredibly challenging and often require a nuanced approach,"" she said. ""It's essential that social workers have access to the right resources and support so that they can make informed decisions that are in the best interests of the child."" The case has also raised wider questions about the state of child protection services in the UK. Many experts have warned that social services are overstretched and under-resourced, which makes it difficult for them to provide the necessary support to vulnerable families. Despite the challenges, the council says that it remains committed to protecting children and supporting families in need. It has put in place a range of new measures designed to improve safeguarding, including better training for social workers and more investment in child protection services. As for the family at the center of this case, their future remains uncertain. The council says that it will continue to work with them to provide the necessary support, but many people are calling for more radical action. Whatever the outcome, this case highlights the importance of providing the right support to vulnerable families. With more investment and better training for social workers, we can hopefully prevent cases like this from happening in the future, and ensure that every child has the chance to grow up in a safe and supportive environment.","(470, 20)","By.

","For the fifth year straight, Washington ranked as the country's most bicycle-friendly state, thanks to policies designed to create alternatives to driving, according to the League of American Bicyclists. The advocacy group's Bicycle Friendly State Program ranks the states each year under a series of criteria, from laws and regulations that govern bicycling to policies for accommodating cyclists and infrastructure funding. In each of the top five states -- Washington, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Colorado and Oregon -- the focus of the respective Departments of Transportation is not only on highways but on accommodating pedestrians, cyclists and transportation on ferries and trains, said Matt Wempe, the league's state and local advocacy coordinator. Arkansas, considered one of the least safe places for cyclists based on fatalities, was at the bottom of the list. The league's top recommendation was to adopt a statewide bicycle plan and to establish an advisory committee to oversee its implementation. Washington is considered a model for all other states on using federal funds for bicycle and pedestrian projects. It also earned points for adopting a safe passing and vulnerable road user law, which carries enhanced penalties for motorists who severely injure or kill a cyclist or pedestrian, Wempe said. It also creates a minimum 3-foot ""safe passing"" distance for cyclists by motorists. Related: Drivers and cyclists square off on sharing the road to work . The state also has a ""complete streets"" policy, which means new roads must be designed with cyclists and pedestrians in mind, Wempe said. ""Every state says bicycles are treated the same as vehicles, but that needs to be clarified,"" he said. ""We're stressing that bicycles have the same rights and responsibilities as motor vehicles, but their needs in terms of infrastructure need to be clarified."" Minnesota, which claimed the No. 2 spot, also has a complete streets policy. The state also earned kudos for its bike-sharing program and plans to expand bike trails along the Mississippi River. Colorado cracked the top 10 for the first time with qualities that make it a model for other states in terms of traffic laws, Wempe said. It has a safe passing law and a Share the Road Campaign; cyclists are allowed to ride side-by-side. It also has bicycle commuter share of more than 1%, more than double the national average. ""We are encouraged to see significant progress in top states like Washington, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts,"" Andy Clarke, president of the League of American Bicyclists, said in a statement. ""But, as the scores clearly highlight, there's much work to be done in critical areas like infrastructure and funding. Overall, we see states -- and especially state Departments of Transportation and state legislatures -- lagging behind cities and the expectations of local cyclists, despite the many well documented benefits of a more active lifestyle.""","(539, 21)","Washington has once again been crowned the most bicycle-friendly state in the U.S. for the fifth year in a row. According to the League of American Bicyclists, Washington takes the top spot for its commitment to developing cycling infrastructure, improving safety for cyclists and promoting cycling as a mode of transportation.  One notable effort that contributed to Washington's top spot is the newly passed law that imposes penalties on motorists who injure or kill cyclists. The law aims to promote safety and accountability on the roads, making Washington an even safer place to bike.  Minnesota claimed the second spot thanks to its successful bike-sharing program and plans to expand its bike trails network, providing more options for cyclists. The state's Nice Ride program, which launched in 2010, has since grown to 2,000 bikes, available for rent at over 200 stations, and boasts a highly successful membership program. Moving down the ladder, Arkansas comes in last for bicycle-friendliness. The state failed to make significant progress towards improving cycling infrastructure, and its bike safety laws remain lax. The lack of bike-specific infrastructure and education programs for cyclists means that cycling in Arkansas can be a dangerous endeavor. Biking has become a growing trend in recent years, with more Americans choosing to use bicycles as their primary mode of transportation. As the demand for bicycle-friendly cities grows, states and cities are increasingly investing in cycling infrastructure, aiming to improve safety and encourage more people to take up cycling.  According to a report by PeopleForBikes, the U.S has witnessed an increase in bike routes, lanes, and trails nationwide since 2010, making it easier for people to ride a bicycle. Improvements in bicycle infrastructure are essential in promoting active transportation, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality. States like Washington, Minnesota, and California have set the standard for investing in cycling infrastructure, and more states are following suit. In 2020, New York City announced plans to invest $58.4 million in cycling infrastructure, including $34 million in protected bike lanes, while cyclist activist groups called on the city authorities to make larger investments in cycling infrastructure.  Despite the progress made in some states, there is still a long way to go before cycling infrastructure is readily accessible nationwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of active transportation, with many people turning to cycling to avoid public transport. However, without proper infrastructure and education, cycling can still be hazardous.  In conclusion, Washington continues to lead the nation when it comes to creating a bicycle-friendly environment. Enactment of laws like the one incentivizing motorists to drive safely and other moves such as investment in cycling infrastructure improves the cycling experience which can also contribute to reducing carbon emissions. As more cities and states work to promote cycling as a viable mode of transportation, it is necessary to focus more on protecting cyclists, providing bicycle-specific infrastructure, and educating motorists on road safety.","(543, 21)","For the fifth year straight, Washington ranked as the country's most bicycle-friendly state, thanks to

","By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:06 EST, 12 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:46 EST, 13 July 2013 . A supervisor at a Seattle warehouse was caught raping a fellow worker who was developmentally disabled whilst he was on the job and then went on to justify his vile actions by saying the woman 'wouldn't know the difference.' James A. Neligan, 54, was caught in the act as he was having sex with the woman inside a cubicle. According to court documents, his colleague had the intellectual abilities of an eight or nine-year-old. Still free: The case was heard at the King County Superior Courthouse in Seattle, but Neligan has not been jailed . Caught with his fly down and genitals exposed, the creep is alleged to have told the other worker to 'mind her own business.' A Seattle Police detective said the alleged victim then began crying. Neligan shook his head, zipped his fly and walked away. Neligan went on to say 'don't tell nobody' and that she would get in trouble if she told someone about the incident. The . woman said the man touched her sexually after she told him not to, and . that he continued to do so after she told him to stop. Both had worked for together for more than ten years at the warehouse where Neligan was a supervisor. Neligan . was fired following the incident and claimed the witness who caught him . had misunderstood what was happening in the cubicle. He soon changed his story after detectives told him that DNA evidence collected following the incident. Sweating profusely, Neligan said he had been teaching the woman how to have sex after she asked him for advise. He is alleged to have admitted having sexual contact with her for about a year. 'I asked James if he was ever nervous about getting caught and he replied ‘Oh of course, yeah,’' the detective told the court. 'I asked why and he explained because he knew he wasn’t supposed to be doing it.' When asked if he felt guilty about being physical with the victim because she was developmentally disabled, Neligan said 'probably, I would assume so; I guess that would have a lot more to do with it, yeah.' Although Neligan has been charged in the case, he had not been jailed.","(446, 29)","A former college employee has been convicted of performing sex acts on a mentally challenged coworker. James A. Neligan, who worked at a college in Florida, was found guilty of having sexual relations with another staff member whose mental capacity was compared to that of a nine-year-old child. Neligan initially claimed that the acts were consensual between adults. However, his story quickly fell apart after DNA evidence was recovered by police during their investigation into the alleged sexual assault. The incident took place in 2018, when the victim, whose identity is being kept confidential, was discovered by college authorities in a classroom with Neligan, who was performing sexual acts upon her. The victim was immediately removed from the situation and an investigation by authorities began. When authorities questioned Neligan, he maintained that the sexual acts were consensual between two adults. However, a DNA sample taken from the victim proved otherwise. The sample matched that of Neligan, who then changed his story, admitting to having sexual relations with the woman. The victim's mental age was determined to be that of a nine-year-old, making her unable to give consent. Neligan was charged with sexual battery on a vulnerable person and was found guilty by a jury in court. The college released a statement condemning Neligan's actions, stating that they were disappointed in his behavior and that the safety and well-being of their students and staff remain a top priority. The college is also offering counseling to anyone affected by the incident. The victim's family released a statement expressing their gratitude to the authorities for their support and guidance throughout the trial. They also expressed their hope that this situation would bring awareness to the issue of vulnerable individuals being taken advantage of in the workplace. Neligan now faces several years in prison and will also be required to register as a sex offender. His conviction serves as a reminder that sexual assault and misconduct will not be tolerated, especially when it involves vulnerable individuals who are unable to fully comprehend or consent to sexual activity.","(377, 17)","By.

James A Neligan has been jailed for 12 years after being found guilty of having sex with a woman with the mental age of nine.
Neligan was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court.
He was also found guilty of one count of sexual activity in the presence of a child and two counts of causing a child to watch a sexual act.
The court heard that Neligan had sex with the woman, who has the mental capacity of a nine year old, at his home in Liverpool.
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court that she had sex with Neligan because she wanted to have a baby.
She said: 'I wanted a baby and I wanted to have sex with him.
'I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't think it was wrong. I thought it was normal.'
Neligan told the jury that the sex was consensual and that the woman had told him that she was 18.
He said that she had told him she was 19 and that she had lied about her age.
He told the jury: 'She told me she was over 18 and I believed her.
'She said she had lied to me about her age because she didn't want me to think she was a child.'
But the jury found him guilty of all the charges.
Judge Robert Warnock told Neligan: 'You have been found guilty by a jury of your peers of the most serious of offences.
'You have abused your position of trust as a teacher and you have abused the trust of a vulnerable young woman.
'It is clear from the evidence that you knew she was vulnerable and you took advantage of her.'
The judge told Neligan that he would have to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life and that he would be subject to a sexual harm prevention order.
He added: 'This is a very serious case.
'The victim in this case is a young woman who has a mental age equivalent to that of a child.
'There is no doubt in my mind that she was a victim of sexual abuse.
'This was not a consensual sexual relationship. It was a sexual relationship between a teacher and a vulnerable young person.'
The court was told that Neligan was a teacher at a special school for children with learning difficulties.
He had been in a relationship with the woman for 18 months and had sex with her on a number of occasions at his home.
The jury heard that the woman told police that she had been abused by her father from the age of 11.

Horrifying: Live dogs are sat in cages before being roasted with a blow torch on the muck-covered pavement . Grotesque: Tourists look in horror at lizards lying on their backs - cut open - with their insides on display . Live dogs sit in cages before they are roasted with blowtorches on the pavement. Three-metre-long snakes lie sprawled across the tables of blood-covered carcasses. Other delights include pickled rats, boar legs, and bite-size bats on sticks. And roasted lizards are cut open and displayed on their backs - with their insides on show. Casual: Locals casually survey the bloody carcasses of boars and bats, which are delicacies in the region . Snack: Bite-size black bats are sold on sticks to market-goers, which will make holiday-goers' stomachs turn . Controversy: The market is under constant surveillance by the government after selling endangered species . Graphic: Vegetables and spices are sold at the market but the hanging boar legs will stay in tourists' minds . The market, in the northern region of  Sulawesi, was marred by controversy in 1993 after government inspectors found sellers to be trading babirusa, an endangered type of wild pig. Despite numerous regulations put in place, it took years to eliminate the trade. However, the bizarre market has now become something of a tourist attraction - but few are willing to taste their way through the full menu. Not far from Langowan, the Tomohon Traditional Market also attracts a fair few horrified holidaymakers - and families planning their evening meal. All in a day's work: A market seller hacks away at a three-metre-long snake using three different knives . Portions: The segments are gruesomely displayed on the dirty, tiled worktops for customers to buy . Stash: One customer has stocked up on roasted rats for this evening's meal, piling them all into a basket . Grab-and-go: This man appears to have forgotten a bag - but seems not to mind carrying to wild boars' legs . Family day out: A child munches on a treat bought from the traditional market while his family select their meal . They casually survey the torched animals - lying frozen with a facial expression of horror - before selecting an entire snake or dog to serve up to the kids later. Travel blogger Raymond Walsh described the smell of the Tomohon market on his blog www.manonthelam.com. Mr Walsh said: 'In a word, appalling. There's something about the air that changes when there's that much death around. 'It hangs heavy and it made me queasy and light-headed at the same time... It's the first time I'd ever encountered anything like it.'","(565, 32)","Langowan Market in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, is attracting tourists from all over the world who want to taste the unique and bizarre traditional food. Vendors at the market offer a variety of exotic dishes, including spit-roasted bats, battered snake, pickled rats, and boar legs.

Despite these concerns, some vendors continue to sell these illegal products, which are seen as delicacies by many locals. The government's efforts to curb such sales have had little success, as many of these vendors have been doing business for generations and rely on the sale of these items for their livelihood. Local residents are divided on the issue, with some arguing that the market is part of their cultural heritage and should be protected from outside influence. Others believe that changes need to be made to ensure that the sale of endangered species ceases immediately. The local government, meanwhile, is exploring ways to address the concerns raised by conservationists without disrupting the livelihoods of the market's vendors. One solution being suggested is the introduction of alternative sources of income for vendors who stop selling illegal and endangered products. Despite the controversy, tourists continue to flock to the market to taste the unique traditional food on offer. Many visitors are aware of the ethical and environmental concerns surrounding the sale of certain products and do their best to avoid them, opting instead for dishes made from locally sourced, sustainable ingredients. Langowan Market is an important part of local culture, and the government's efforts to conserve endangered species are to be applauded. However, it is important to ensure that the livelihoods of the vendors are not negatively impacted in the process. With the right measures and support, it is possible to continue preserving and celebrating cultural traditions while also protecting threatened species.","(442, 18)","By. Mia De Graaf.

","A soldier gave his sister the surprise of a lifetime by showing up unannounced at her wedding. Jessie Smith, 26, hadn’t seen her brother in several years before her brother Ryan Douglas surprised her by attending her June 29 wedding in Virginia. With Douglas is currently serving active duty in the US Army, Smith had resigned herself to the fact her brother would not be at the blessed event. ‘I was upset that he couldn’t make it but understood he had a career that he had obligations to,’ Smith told ABC News. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Surprise!: Soldier shows at sister's wedding, brings her to tears . Douglas knew weeks in advance that he would be able to attend the wedding, but intentionally kept it a secret from most of the family for fearing of letting the secret out, according to ABC. When Douglas showed up in uniform it confused the photographer, who initially thought it might be Smith's soon-to-be husband. Nick Smith serves in the Coast Guard. ‘The photographer asked me, ‘Is Nick wearing his uniform?,’ because she saw someone wearing a uniform outside,” Smith told ABC. “I said no, and then wondered who was wearing their uniform. I peeked my head around and saw my brother and his wife and sister-in-law and freaked out.’ Smith cried tears of joy as she hugged her brother for the first time in what probably felt like an eternity, before hustling everyone out of the room to avoid her soon-to-husband. Tears of joy: Seeing her brother made Smith cry tears of happiness . Wiping away tears: Smith had to literally wipe away the tears after hugging brother Douglas . ‘I was ecstatic but also remembered we had to avoid Nick so I quickly ushered them all inside,’ Smith told ABC. A exceptional day made even more so by a rare visit from her brother, Smith told ABC she could not have been happier. ‘I rarely get to see my brother as we are both busy working on our careers and education, and it was amazing to get to have him there for my special day.’","(406, 18)","A heartwarming reunion between siblings took place in a small town in Oklahoma. Jessie Smith, who had not seen her brother Ryan Douglas in several years, was finally reunited with him. Douglas is a member of the United States Army and had been stationed overseas for an extended period of time.  Douglas had kept his attendance a secret from most of his family, including his sister Jessie. However, weeks before his holiday break, he decided to reach out to his sister and surprise her with his arrival. Jessie was overjoyed at the unexpected reunion and could hardly contain her excitement. Ryan was excited to show his sister around the base, and they spent several days together catching up on old times. Jessie says that despite the time apart, the siblings were able to quickly pick up where they left off. They visited some local attractions and shared many laughs and memorable moments. Ryan shared with Jessie the various stories of his deployment, his experience in the army and how serving the country has changed his life significantly. Jessie expressed her pride in her brother and his accomplishments in the army. During their time together, the siblings reminisced about their childhood and their shared experiences, and created new memories that will last a lifetime. Although Ryan has to return to duty soon, the reunion has left a lasting impression on both of them, and Jessie is already looking forward to the next time they will be together. Their family members were genuinely happy for the brother and sister, and expressed their appreciation for Ryan's service to the nation. Ryan's father praised his son's ""heroic journey"" and said, ""we are blessed to have the men and women who serve our nation."" This reunion highlights the importance of family and how simple gestures such as a surprise visit can create lifelong memories. It is also a testament to the bravery and dedication of the members of our armed forces, who sacrifice so much to serve our nation. Jessie and Ryan's reunion serves as a reminder to cherish the time we have with our loved ones and to always show appreciation to those who serve our nation. For the siblings, the reunion was a much-needed opportunity to rekindle their bond and to bring their familial ties closer together.","(427, 19)","A soldier gave his sister the surprise of a lifetime by showing up unannounced at

A series of videos appeared online Saturday purporting to show Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the highest-ranking
","A series of videos appeared online Saturday purporting to show Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the highest-ranking member of Saddam Hussein's regime to evade capture, deriding Iraq's current leadership. Al-Douri, who the U.S. military says helped finance the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, was the ""king of clubs"" in a deck of playing cards used by American troops following the 2003 invasion to identify the most-wanted regime officials. There have been several claims that al-Douri was either killed or captured, though a man claiming to be al-Douri has released a number of audio messages over the years taunting Iraqi and U.S. officials. Al-Douri, who served as a military commander and vice president in Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime, was last seen on video shortly after the invasion of Iraq. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos posted on YouTube or the identity of the man, though he bears a striking resemblance to al-Douri. In the clips, the man who claims to be al-Douri wears an olive military uniform and sits behind a desk with an Iraqi flag in the background. He derides Iraq's Shiite-dominated government, led by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, as well as what he describes as meddling by neighboring Iran. Al-Maliki's Dawa party, says al-Douri, ""has announced Iraq as the Shiite capital."" He said nine years have passed since the invasion and Iraq is still in peril. ""Everyone can hear the sounds of danger echoing daily and threatening the country,"" he said. The videos were posted on what is the 65th anniversary of the Arab Socialist Baath Party, a political party founded in Syria that later provided the political basis for Iraq's now outlawed Baath Party. The U.S. military has said al-Douri helped finance the Sunni insurgency with money he transferred to Syria before the government collapsed shortly after the U.S.-led invasion. Al-Douri was the deputy chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council, and U.S. officials have said he played a key role in the 1988 chemical attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja that left thousands dead and thousands more wounded. He also is accused of playing a role in the brutal crackdowns on Kurdish and Shiite revolts in Iraq that followed the 1991 Persian Gulf War.","(410, 14)","Former senior Iraqi official Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, known as the ""king of clubs"" for his identification on a deck of playing cards used to locate wanted officials, has reportedly resurfaced in a video. In the clips, which were released last week, al-Douri can be seen criticizing Iraq's Shiite leaders. Al-Douri was a prominent figure during the regime of Saddam Hussein, where he served as the vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council. Following the overthrow of Hussein's regime in 2003, al-Douri went into hiding, and he had been reported dead on several occasions. However, in the video, he appears to be in good health and talks about the current state of Iraq. The U.S. military has accused al-Douri of funding the Sunni insurgency in Iraq that caused many deaths and injuries, and his capture or killing was a top priority for the U.S. forces during their involvement in the country. The Iraqi government has also issued an arrest warrant for al-Douri, accusing him of terrorism activities. In the video, al-Douri can be seen sitting in a chair wearing a military uniform and addressing the camera. He criticizes the current Iraqi government, which he describes as ""sectarian,"" and calls for the formation of a national government that represents all segments of Iraqi society. Al-Douri, who is believed to be in his 70s, also accuses Iran of interfering in Iraqi affairs and backing Shiite militias that have committed atrocities against Sunni Muslims. He calls on Iraqis to unite against what he calls Iran's attempts to dominate the region. The video has sparked concern among the Iraqi authorities, who fear that it could encourage Sunni militants to launch attacks against Shiite targets. The Iraqi security forces have stepped up their efforts to track down al-Douri, and they have urged the public to report any sightings of him. Al-Douri's reappearance in the video comes at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which are both vying for influence in Iraq. The U.S. has accused Iran of supporting Shiite militias in the country, and the two nations have engaged in a war of words in recent months. Al-Douri's video is a reminder of the deep divisions that continue to exist in Iraq, despite the defeat of ISIS and the ousting of the Saddam Hussein regime. The challenge now is for the Iraqi authorities to address these divisions and find a way to bring the country together.","(451, 17)","A series of videos appeared online Saturday purporting to show Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the highest-ranking
Saddam Hussein-era official still at large in Iraq, denouncing the country's Shiite-led government.
The U.S. military said it could not confirm the authenticity of the videos, but if they are genuine, they would
mark the first time al-Douri has been seen in public since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
In the videos, a man who identifies himself as al-Douri criticizes Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his
Shiite-led government for failing to provide basic services such as electricity and clean water.
Al-Douri also denounces the U.S. military presence in Iraq, which is scheduled to end by the end of the year,
and calls on Iraqis to rise up against the government.
Al-Douri, who is believed to be in his mid-60s, was Saddam Hussein's vice president and a member of the
ruling Revolutionary Command Council. He was one of the most powerful men in Iraq before the 2003
U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam's regime.
Al-Douri has been on the FBI's most-wanted list since 2003, with a reward of up to $10 million for information
leading to his capture. The U.S. State Department has offered a $30 million reward for information leading to
the arrest or conviction of al-Douri and other senior members of Saddam's regime.
In the past few years, al-Douri has emerged as the leader of the Naqshabandi Army, a Sunni insurgent group
that has carried out numerous attacks against U.S. and Iraqi forces. The group is believed to have ties to al-
Qaida in Iraq and other Sunni extremist groups.
Al-Douri's whereabouts have been a mystery since the fall of Saddam's regime in 2003. He is believed to have
fled to Syria after the U.S. invasion, but there have been reports that he has been hiding in various parts of
Iraq, including the northern city of Mosul and the western province of Anbar.
In recent months, there have been several reports that al-Douri had been killed or captured, but none of them
have been confirmed. If the videos are genuine, it would suggest that al-Douri is still alive and well, and that he
remains a major threat to the stability of Iraq.
The appearance of the videos comes at a time when Iraq is facing a number of challenges, including a surge in
violence, political instability, and economic problems. The country is also struggling to deal with the aftermath
of the Islamic State group's takeover of large parts of northern and western Iraq in 2014.
The emergence of the videos is likely to raise concerns about the security situation in Iraq and the ability of the
government to maintain control over the country. It is also likely to fuel speculation about the future of al-
Douri and his role in the ongoing conflict in Iraq.
The videos are also likely to have an impact on U.S. policy towards Iraq. The United States has been
supporting the Iraqi government in its fight against the Islamic State group, but the emergence of the videos
could raise questions about the effectiveness of U.S. efforts to stabilize the country.
Overall, the appearance of the videos is a significant development in the ongoing struggle for power in Iraq.

Walking the catwalk in high heels can be tricky, even for the industry's most seasoned models. And on today's This Morning show, one producer who had to fill in for a model almost hurt her baby as well as her pride as she toppled off the set holding her young daughter. Model Ellie, who is also the show's producer, was carrying her daughter Poppy when she walked straight off the side of the catwalk in a Mrs Santa costume, leaving little Poppy in tears. Scroll down for video . Taking a tumble: Ellie, the show's producer who was modelling a Christmas outfit with daughter Poppy, tripped from the runway . The show had opened with adorable young Poppy scratching her head and looking sleepy in a cute and cosy Christmas one piece as presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield cooed over her. 'Are you sleepy?' they asked as Holly became quite taken by the small child. But things took a turn for the worse as Ellie set off down the catwalk to model her Mrs Santa outfit. It started well: ...but as she strutted down the catwalk and approached the end she took a tumble . As she modelled a Santa outfit, she walked off the side and stumbled off the catwalk.

The incident occurred when Ellie, who was dressed up as Mrs. Santa, lost her balance and toppled over the edge. However, the situation quickly turned into an emotional moment when Ellie managed to hold onto a baby named Poppy who was also on the catwalk with her. As the cameras kept rolling, viewers could hear the sound of Poppy crying in the background while Ellie tried to regain her footing. The tension in the studio was palpable as the presenter and other models watched on in concern. However, Ellie managed to hold on to Poppy and make her way back to safety without any further missteps. The incident happened earlier today during a live broadcast of This Morning's fashion segment. Ellie, who usually works behind the scenes on the show, had stepped in to model for a segment on festive-themed outfits. Her turn on the catwalk soon took a turn for the worse when she lost her footing and nearly fell off the stage. Fortunately, Ellie's maternal instincts kicked in, and she managed to hold onto Poppy, ensuring the baby's safety despite the unexpected tumble. Though this was a terrifying moment for those in the studio, it also demonstrated the quick thinking and problem-solving skills needed for such events. Ellie is being hailed as a hero for her bravery in protecting the infant from harm. In the aftermath of the incident, the presenter of the show has praised Ellie's quick thinking, and the studio staff has extended their support to the two. It is not clear whether Ellie sustained any injuries during her fall. However, she has received widespread praise for her bravery and her quick thinking in an unexpected and potentially hazardous situation. The incident has been a talking point on social media, with many praising Ellie for her bravery and maternal instincts during the incident. While accidental mishaps are not uncommon during live television segments, Ellie's quick thinking has been widely appreciated by viewers and fellow colleagues alike. This moment serves as a reminder of the importance of preparedness and quick thinking in a crisis, and a testament to the strength of the human spirit in the face of unexpected obstacles.","(436, 18)","By.

This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby was left red-faced after her co-presenter Phillip Schofield accidentally flashed his manhood live on air.
The 33-year-old mother-of-two, who is currently pregnant with her third child, was forced to cover her face with her hands in horror as she realised what had happened.
Phillip, 50, had been demonstrating how to put up a Christmas tree on the ITV1 daytime show when the incident occurred.
He said: ‘I’m going to show you how to put up your Christmas tree. I’m going to do it properly this time.’
Holly, who was sitting next to him on the sofa, replied: ‘That’s what you said last year.’
Phillip then proceeded to demonstrate how to put up the tree, which was decorated with baubles, tinsel and fairy lights.
However, as he bent down to pick up a bauble from the floor, his trousers slipped down to reveal his manhood.
Holly quickly covered her face with her hand as she realised what was happening.
She said: ‘Oh my God! Oh my God!’
Phillip, who was unaware of what had happened, carried on putting up the tree as if nothing had happened.
Holly, who is married to Dan Baldwin and has two children, Harry, six, and Belle, four, with him, said: ‘I can’t believe that just happened.’
Phillip said: ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’

It has long been an integral part of school chemistry lessons - and a revision
","It has long been an integral part of school chemistry lessons - and a revision nightmare for students the world over. Now there is one more element to add to the periodic table - and a 'super-heavy' one at that. Scientists in Sweden have confirmed the existence of a new chemical element, but its name may need some work. The 'super-heavy' man-made element has been temporarily named 'ununpentium' and refers to the element's 115th place in the periodic table. Scientists in Sweden have confirmed the existence of a new chemical element. The 'super-heavy' man-made element has been temporarily named 'ununpentium' and refers to its 115th place in the periodic table . Ununpentium will likely get a new name if the discovery is formally . approved by experts from the International Union of Pure and Applied . Physics and Chemistry. It presently has an . atomic symbol of Uup and is approximately 289 times heavier than hydrogen, which is the . lightest element. Researchers at Lund University in Sweden lead the research and said their find backs up claims by teams in Russia and the United States a decade ago that had remained unverified until now. The Swedish scientists say they conducted experiments which allowed them to detect the `fingerprint' of the short-lived but heavy element. The experiment was conducted at the GSI research facility in Germany. 'This was a very successful experiment and is one of the most important in the field in recent years', said Dirk Rudolph, Professor at the Division of Nuclear Physics at Lund University. Ununpentium will likely get a new name if the discovery is formally approved by experts from the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics and Chemistry. It presently has an atomic symbol of Uup and is approximately 289 times heavier than hydrogen - the lightest element . Besides the observations of the new chemical element, the researchers have also gained access to data that gives them a deeper insight into the structure and properties of super-heavy atomic nuclei. By bombarding a thin film of americium with calcium ions, the research team was able to measure photons in connection with the new element’s alpha decay. Certain energies of the photons agreed with the expected energies for X-ray radiation, which is a ‘fingerprint’ of a given element. Some people have claimed ununpentium is used by UFOs as a component in gravity wave generators, The Telegraph reported. The new element also makes an appearance in computer games including Tomb Raider and Call of Duty, where it is an energy source for weapons and teleporters. However, due to its unstable nature, its uses in the real world are likely to be few and far between. Livermorium, which has the atomic number of 116, is the most recent element to be approved and win a spot on the periodic table in May 2012.","(521, 25)","Ununpentium: The Heavy Element in Search of a New Name Ununpentium, the heavy man-made element currently placed at 115th on the periodic table, may soon have a new name if experts finally approve its discovery. The element, also known as element 115 or E115, was first synthesized in 2003 by a team of Russian and American physicists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. Like many other artificial elements, ununpentium is extremely unstable, with a half-life of only a few milliseconds. However, it is still of great interest to scientists, as its unique properties could potentially lead to the development of new materials with extraordinary properties. But ununpentium is not just a topic of discussion for physicists and chemists. It has also made appearances in popular culture, particularly in computer games such as Call of Duty. In the game, ununpentium is portrayed as a powerful energy source that powers advanced weapons and spacecraft. However, for some people, ununpentium is more than just a fictional element. Many conspiracy theorists and alien enthusiasts believe that the element has been used by extraterrestrial beings for advanced technology. They point to supposed accounts of ununpentium being recovered from crashed UFOs, as well as the fact that the element was allegedly mentioned in classified documents supposedly leaked by whistleblowers. Despite these claims, there is no concrete evidence to support the notion that ununpentium has any extraterrestrial origins or applications. But the search for a new name for element 115 is not just the result of conspiracy theories or pop culture references. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the organization responsible for officially recognizing new elements and approving their names, requires that elements be named based on certain criteria, such as honoring a person, a place, a property, or a mythological concept. For ununpentium, the current temporary name is simply based on its atomic number, which stands for the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. However, this name is not very practical, as it does not provide any information about the element's properties or origins. Several proposals have been made for a new name for ununpentium, such as moscovium, after the city of Moscow, where the element was first synthesized. Other suggestions include eka-bismuth, to emphasize the element's position as a member of the bismuth group, or after famous scientists or science fiction characters. But proposing a name for a new element is not an easy task, as the name must be agreed upon by experts in the field and undergo a thorough review process. For instance, the proposed name must not be duplicated with any other element or mineral name, and must not hold any political or commercial connotations. While the hunt for a new name continues, ununpentium remains an intriguing subject both for scientists and for those interested in the intersection of science, culture, and mythology. Whether it will ever become a staple of advanced technology or remain a curiosity of the periodic table is yet to be seen, but one thing is certain: element 115 will need a new name that does justice to its unique properties and place in history.","(591, 21)","It has long been an integral part of school chemistry lessons - and a revision
topic for A-level students - but now ununpentium, the 115th element in the
periodic table, has been officially recognised by the International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
The IUPAC is the global authority on chemical nomenclature, terminology,
standardised methods and atomic weights, and its approval means that
ununpentium can now be referred to by its official name, moscovium.
Moscovium was first created in 2003 by scientists at the Joint Institute for
Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, and the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California, USA. It was named after Moscow, the capital of
Russia, where the Dubna institute is located.
However, the IUPAC only recognises elements that have been produced in
sufficient quantities for their properties to be studied in detail. In the case of
moscovium, this meant that it had to be created at least 10 times before the
IUPAC would give it the green light.
This was achieved in 2016, when scientists at the RIKEN Nishina Center for
Accelerator-Based Science in Wako, Japan, created 20 atoms of moscovium
by bombarding bismuth-209 with zinc-70 ions.
The IUPAC's recognition of moscovium means that it can now be added to
the periodic table alongside the other 114 elements that have been
discovered so far. These include ununoctium, which was discovered in 2002
and is currently the heaviest element known to exist.
While moscovium may not be as well-known as some of the other elements
in the periodic table, it has still managed to make an appearance in popular
culture. For example, it is featured in the video game Call of Duty: Modern
Warfare, where it is used as a weapon by the game's protagonist, Captain
Price.
In addition, some conspiracy theorists believe that moscovium is used by
aliens to power their spacecraft. This theory is based on the fact that
moscovium has a very high melting point, which means that it can withstand
extremely high temperatures. However, there is no scientific evidence to
support this claim.
Despite its relatively recent discovery, moscovium has already made a
significant impact on the world of chemistry. Its recognition by the IUPAC is
a testament to the hard work and dedication of the scientists who
discovered it, and it is sure to inspire future generations of chemists to
continue exploring the mysteries of the periodic table.","(445, 16)","It has long been an integral part of school chemistry lessons - and a revision

electrons in its nucleus.
It is the first new element to be added to the periodic table since 2002,
when the IUPAC approved the discovery of element 114, dubbing it 'flerovium'.
The discovery was made by a team led by Lawrence Livermore National

The team, which included scientists from the University of California at
Berkeley and the University of Texas at Austin, used a particle accelerator
to smash together atoms of americium-243 and californium-249 to create
ununpentium.

However, it has also been suggested that element 115 could be used by
humans in the future to create a new generation of nuclear weapons.
The discovery of the new element has been welcomed by chemists and
scientists around the world.
'It's a great day for chemistry,' said Lawrence Livermore's chief
scientist, John B. Goodenough. 'We've been waiting for this for a long
time. It's been a long time coming, but it's worth the wait.'
'Element 115' is the latest in a long line of man-made elements to be
discovered in recent years.
In 1996, scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in
Dubna, Russia, created element 114 by smashing together atoms of californium
and americium.
In the same year, scientists at JINR also created element 113 by smashing
together atoms of curium and berkelium.
And in 2010, scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee
created element 112 by smashing together isotopes of the element 'californium'.
Element 113 was named 'ununquadium' and element 112 was given the name
'ununhexium'.

'I was hoping for a Williams to be between us, it didn't happen, but hopefully that can be the case tomorrow. 'My mindset now is I need to get the job done, to continue with the form I showed at the last race in Brazil. In any case I'm sure it will be a great race.'","(491, 22)","Abu Dhabi, UAE - Nico Rosberg secured pole position for the highly anticipated season finale at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Saturday. Championship leader and Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton will start behind him, almost four tenths of a second slower. Despite missing out on pole position, Hamilton only needs to finish in second place to clinch his third world championship, regardless of where Rosberg finishes. Hamilton looked confident during practice sessions leading up to the qualifying round, where he posted the fastest lap on Friday. However, Rosberg found his stride at the crucial moment and proved to be a difficult opponent to beat. Hamilton did his best to catch up, but he was unable to match Rosberg's pace, ultimately falling short by a considerable margin. Speaking after the race, Hamilton expressed his disappointment in failing to secure pole position but was confident that he still had plenty to fight for on Sunday. ""It's not the result that I wanted, but I have another opportunity to win this championship,"" Hamilton said. ""I'm here to win and that's what I'm going to try to do."" Hamilton's determination was evident in his post-qualifying preparations. After speaking with the press, he spent some time with famous American hit-maker Pharrell Williams, who is in the city for a gig. The two spent some time together discussing music and sports, with Hamilton eager to take his mind off the race and unwind. If Hamilton is to win the championship, he must overcome the high pressure of the Abu Dhabi race, which promises to be one of the most competitive and important in recent history. Hamilton's teammate, Rosberg, is just 12 points behind him in the championship standings, and will surely have an eye on the prize himself. One mistake from Hamilton and Rosberg could take advantage and steal the title from right under his nose. Despite the pressure and attention that both drivers will face on Sunday, they will have plenty of support from their teams and the thousands of fans expected to attend the race. Formula One in Abu Dhabi has been one of the highlights of the season, with a stunning track, star-studded crowds, and world-class drivers battling it out on the circuit. The 2016 championship decider promises to be one for the history books, and Hamilton and Rosberg will be looking to leave their mark on the sport. With the championship title in reach, Hamilton has everything to play for on Sunday. Despite starting behind Rosberg on the grid, he is confident that he has what it takes to clinch the championship and take his place in the pantheon of the greatest drivers in Formula One history. Only time will tell who will come out on top in Abu Dhabi, but one thing is for sure: it's going to be an action-packed and thrilling showdown between two of the very best drivers in the world.","(544, 21)","So, will Lewis Hamilton be Happy after Sunday’s Formula One season finale in Abu Dhabi?

LONDON, England (CNN) -- A U.S. company is offering a rare chance to holiday on
","LONDON, England (CNN) -- A U.S. company is offering a rare chance to holiday on a mega-yacht once used by a Hollywood star and her husband -- and thanks to the recession it's actually affordable. The 100-foot Katania normally would attract an additional $49,500 charter fee for a week's use. The 100-foot Katania was chartered by Hollywood star Hilary Swank and her husband, Chad Lowe. Seattle, Washington-based mega-yacht rental business CEO Expeditions usually charges around $100,000 a week to charter their 100-plus-foot yachts, but they have introduced a deal waiving the charter fees -- meaning guests will only need to pay for the running of the vessel. The move to make such vessels more affordable comes as the recession continues to put pressure on the luxury holiday and mega-yacht industries. Although the costs of crew and luxury food aren't extremely cheap, it is expected this move will open up the recession-strained market to many more potential holiday-makers. The Katania now costs less than $3,000 per day. Normally it would attract an additional $49,500 charter fee for a week's use. At the $2,950-per-day special rate, four people can stay on the Katania -- but with the maximum six on board ($450 extra per person) the cost per person is a slightly better $642. The price includes full crew, premium wines, gourmet food prepared by a private chef, amenities such as kayaks, hot tub, fishing/crabbing/shrimping equipment, and even a 30-foot whaler for guest use. According to the company, Swank said of her charter holiday: ""We had an absolutely enchanted time aboard the Katania. A more beautiful yacht does not exist."" There is one small catch with the deal -- the boat is based in the San Juan islands off the coast of Washington and British Columbia, and any cruises to other destinations will attract an additional charge to cover fuel costs. The company's owner, Bruce Milne, released a statement saying the deal was largely a result of the impact of the recession. ""Travel is down, agents and brokers need deals, so rather than just a few full-price charters, we decided to stay busy, put more people to work, and help island tourism by doing charters at cost. ""Since we started chartering 10 years ago, we have been looking for a chance to provide our 'Expeditions to the Extraordinary' in the San Juan Islands at a price any luxury traveler can afford -- this recession provides that opportunity,"" he said. Tim Wiltshire, director and sales broker at international yacht company Burgess Yachts, said the charter market isn't a complete disaster, so he was surprised to see such a discount. ""I wouldn't have expected to see that,"" he said. ""We are seeing discounts on average of about 25 percent. Although some people are trying interesting gimmicks to inspire new business."" Wiltshire said CEO Expedition's fleet isn't among the biggest or most luxurious on the market, and this deal appears to be clever marketing stunt. His opinion is that other larger vessels still warrant their greater price tags.","(584, 22)","In a move that surprised the boating community, a U.S. mega-yacht charter company has decided to waive its massive $50,000 charter fees for a limited time. The company, which specializes in luxury yachts, explained that the economic impact of the recession was the reason behind this discounted deal. The announcement came as a surprise to yacht enthusiasts, who often pay handsomely to spend time on one of these exclusive vessels. It is the perfect opportunity for those who were looking for a memorable experience, but were hesitant to spend too much cash. The discount has made it possible for those who can afford to splurge a bit, to experience a luxurious yacht rental at a price that seems almost too good to be true. Even a yacht chartered by a celebrity like Hilary Swank is now available for under $3,000 a day. Luxury yacht rentals are a popular way for the wealthy to enjoy their vacations. With state-of-the-art amenities and lavish accommodations, chartering a yacht is a surefire way to make a statement. However, the high costs associated with such rentals have made them inaccessible to many. The recession has hit the tourism industry hard, with businesses struggling to stay afloat in the face of a shrinking market. By offering these substantial discounts, the U.S. mega-yacht charter company is hoping to entice more people to rent their vessels and inject some much-needed cash into the industry. The news has generated buzz among the boating community, with many people taking advantage of the discounted deals. The yachts are reportedly filling up quickly, with eager clients looking to book a spot on these exclusive vessels. The company's decision to waive its massive fees has been met with mixed reactions. While some people see the discount as a smart business move, others feel that it devalues the exclusivity and luxury associated with yacht rentals. Despite the mixed reactions, the opportunity to rent a luxury yacht at such a discounted price is too good to pass up for many. It's an opportunity to experience the lifestyle of the super-rich, even if only for a few days. In conclusion, the U.S. mega-yacht charter company's decision to waive its massive fees has created excitement among yacht enthusiasts. The economic impact of the recession has made it more difficult for businesses to attract clients, and this move is an attempt to address that issue. While the decision has been met with mixed reactions, there's no denying that it's an opportunity to experience the luxurious lifestyle of the super-rich at a fraction of the original cost.","(473, 20)","LONDON, England (CNN) -- A U.S. company is offering a rare chance to holiday on

(CNN) -- If Manchester United rallies to win the English Premier League, it might look
","(CNN) -- If Manchester United rallies to win the English Premier League, it might look back at Thursday's Boxing Day clash at Hull as a turning point. United trailed 2-0 within 13 minutes against a side that had lost only one home game in the league all season but Wayne Rooney inspired a comeback and the Red Devils prevailed 3-2 for a fifth straight victory in all competitions. Rooney set up Chris Smalling, scored a stunner to make it 2-2 in the first half and was on hand to pressure James Chester as the defender headed the own goal winner in the second half. Chester -- briefly a United player -- had opened the scoring and was thwarted in injury time by keeper David De Gea as Hull pushed forward in the dying stages. United finished the game with 10 men after Antonio Valencia's late red. Defending champion United, once 13 points off the pace in the Premier League, moved to within five of leader Liverpool ahead of Thursday's later kickoffs. ""We had some poor results at the start of the season and we're showing some real quality in the last few weeks,"" Rooney told Sky Sports. ""We're having a go. We're fighting for each other, we're working hard and we're ready for the challenge. ""Hopefully we can surprise a few people."" Chester took advantage of slack marking in the United box on a corner to lash a shot into the roof of the net in the fourth minute and United defender Jonny Evans failed to clear in the 13th, allowing David Meyler to double the lead on a low effort that deflected off the Northern Irishman. ""It was my fault for the first one,"" said Rooney. But Rooney's perfect delivery teed up Smalling in the 19th minute and the England striker scored his 150th Premier League goal for Manchester United with a volley in the 26th minute. Alex Bruce -- the son of Hull manager and former United defender Steve Bruce -- struck the crossbar as United's defense wobbled again in the 63rd minute before Chester's gaffe from Ashley Young's dangerous cross in the 66th. Hull had more than a few opportunities to equalize in the final 10 minutes. Danny Graham's tame header went straight to De Gea, the Spaniard's poor punch led to panic and following Valencia's second yellow for kicking the ball away in the 90th minute, De Gea stopped Chester with his legs.","(457, 16)","Manchester United secured their fifth consecutive win in all competitions after a thrilling 3-2 comeback victory over Hull City at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon. United were stunned as they found themselves trailing by two goals within the first 13 minutes of the game. However, Wayne Rooney, who was starting his third successive match for the first time since August, sparked United's comeback. The captain assisted one goal, scored another and had a part to play in United's third as they completed a remarkable comeback win. The in-form hosts started the game poorly, with slack defending allowing Hull to take an early 2-0 lead courtesy of goals from James Chester and David Meyler. United's defence was caught out again as Hull threatened to add a third, but they managed to recover their composure and started to dominate possession. Rooney played a key role in United's equalizer, setting up Chris Smalling for the first goal, which gave the hosts a lifeline in the game. United continued to press and were rewarded when Rooney himself equalized with a brilliant curling shot from outside the box. With the momentum firmly in their favor, United continued to surge forward and were eventually rewarded with a wonderful third goal. This time, Rooney played a brilliant pass to Robin van Persie, who calmly slotted it past Allan McGregor in the 66th minute. Hull attempted to mount a comeback of their own, but United's defence held firm to secure all three points. It was only the second home defeat of the season for Steve Bruce's side, who were left to rue their missed opportunities in the early stages of the game. Speaking after the match, United manager Louis van Gaal praised Rooney's contributions and hailed his leadership qualities. ""Rooney showed great character and leadership today. He was the spark that ignited our comeback and I am proud of the way the team responded,"" van Gaal said. The victory took United to fourth place in the Premier League standings, just two points behind third-placed Arsenal. With Rooney in fine form and the team showing a newfound resilience, United fans will be hoping that their impressive run of form continues in the weeks ahead.","(408, 17)","(CNN) -- If Manchester United rallies to win the English Premier League, it might look

Police in Idaho were able to crack the mystery of the parked car burglar in a case that the Scooby Doo gang could have solved - by following the suspect's footprints. Police in the town of Idaho Falls said Mother Nature aided them in the arrest by blanketing the area with some Christmas Eve snow on Monday morning. At about 5:45am, police said they began following tracks in the fresh snow that were suspiciously going from car-to-car on Holbrook Drive. Nabbed: Police reportedly followed footprints to a nearby home where they found their suspect, 20-year-old Cade Thomas Dixon . KIFI-TV reported that the footprints led the officers straight to a nearby home where they found the suspect, 20-year-old Cade Thomas Dixon. Dixon was taken into custody and charged with burglary. Sgt Phil Grimes of the Idaho Falls Police Department told MailOnline: 'Snow is an officer's best friend when it comes to robbery, and the worst enemy of the robber.' Sgt Grimes said that Dixon was booked in the Bonneville County Jail, and bond was set at $15,000. A listing on the jail's website showed that Dixon is still being housed at the jail. Police accused Dixon of trying to enter more than 100 vehicles during his alleged Christmas Eve crime spree, but only two of them had been unlocked. From those vehicles, cops said a small amount of cash and a GPS unit were taken from those cars. Tracking device: Cops said they were able to catch up with the suspect, thanks to footprints left in the snow .","(312, 19)","A burglary suspect was arrested by the police after they followed the trail of footprints that led them to him.

The PanicMe app can send red, amber or green alerts to let up to 30
","The PanicMe app can send red, amber or green alerts to let up to 30 contacts know you are in danger . Smartphone users can now set off a personal panic button to alert family and friends that they are in danger. PanicMe fires off alerts of differing levels of importance to a chosen network of contacts if the user feels threatened or vulnerable. The sender's location is then pinpointed using GPRS and potential responders can see how close they are so they can put a plan of action in place. Offering a traffic light of options, a red alert tells contacts the sender is in imminent danger of being attacked or hurt, amber suggests you will need help soon, while green means you are in a low risk situation, such as being lost or breaking down. The alerts can be sent to up to 30 contacts and can be accessed by police, who are able to login when notified at their control room. Contacts are notified by pop-messages on their smartphones at regular intervals, with the space between the alerts depending on the panic button option. The alerts only stop once the alarm is deactivated by the sender. The app, which launches this week, was developed by experts at DataMe, who worked alongside local police forces to come up with a program to help people feel safer in their daily lives. Former Deputy Chief Constable David Lindley, who who acted as a consultant on the project, says: 'There may be any number of reasons and circumstances why people feel afraid or vulnerable. 'With so many people these days having a . mobile phone, apps such as PanicMe cannot only help to make those in . need feel much safer but can also give peace of mind to those who care . for them.' The alerts are delivered to your contacts' smartphones, using GPRS to pinpoint your location and showing them how close they are to you . Smartphone users can download a limited option of the PanicMe button for free, but it only offers a green panic alert. The complete version costs £14.99 and is available for the year on Apple, Android and Windows Smartphones. The app's release comes months after a survey by Ipsos Mori and Kings College London found that two thirds of adults did not believe that crime rates were falling, suggesting the public is more wary than ever about their personal safety. It's the latest smartphone add-on which can warn us of potentially dangerous situations - the recently unveiled MyWitness records video and audio to gather evidence during unexpected confrontations.","(473, 19)","PanicMe, a new safety app, is set to revolutionize personal safety across the globe. The app sends out red, amber or green alerts to up to 30 chosen contacts when the user feels at risk. PanicMe’s unique features make it easier than ever to find assistance quickly when needed. The app works by pinpointing the user’s location using GPRS and then sends out an alert to the user’s chosen contacts. The contacts receive information on the user’s location, the specific nature of the emergency, and a link to a live map that shows who the closest responders are. The app has been developed in close collaboration with local police forces, ensuring that users have access to the most appropriate and relevant support when they need it most. PanicMe’s founders, two tech entrepreneurs from London, were inspired by their own personal experiences with crime and the lack of support systems available. Andrew and Martin wanted to create an easy-to-use, reliable safety app that would provide reassurance and support to the general public. With its unique features and user-friendly interface, PanicMe is now available to anyone who needs it. The red alert feature is triggered when the user is in serious danger and needs urgent assistance. It notifies the user’s contacts of the emergency and provides a live location so that responders can be sent to the exact location quickly. The amber alert feature is triggered when the user is in a potentially dangerous situation and needs help. For example, if someone is being followed by a stranger or feels unsafe in an unfamiliar area. The alert sends the user’s location and a request for help to their chosen contacts. The green alert feature is for times when the user feels uneasy and wants to let their contacts know where they are. It sends the user’s location to the chosen contacts without raising the alarm level. PanicMe’s founders say that since the app’s launch earlier this year, it has already been downloaded over 100,000 times. They believe that the app’s unique features and collaboration with local police forces have contributed to its growing success. “We wanted to create an app that would help people feel safer in their everyday lives,” Andrew said. “From our own experiences, we knew that many people feel vulnerable when they are out and about, and we wanted to give them a tool that would make them feel more confident and secure.” The app has already been used successfully in several emergency situations, including assaults, car accidents, and lost children. The live map feature has been lauded by many users as a gamechanger, making it easier for responders to locate the user quickly and provide assistance faster. PanicMe is set to expand globally, with plans to launch in several countries over the next year. The app’s developers are keen to work with local police forces in each of these countries to ensure that the app is tailored to the unique needs and challenges of each region. In the age of Covid-19, personal safety is more important than ever before. PanicMe provides peace of mind for anyone who wants to feel safe and secure, whether they are out for a jog around the block or traveling to a new city.

Football has its first £1 billion man – but it’s not Beckham, Messi or Ronaldo.
","Football has its first £1 billion man – but it’s not Beckham, Messi or Ronaldo. The Mail on Sunday can reveal him to be ‘super-agent’ Jorge Mendes, who has masterminded transfers worth an eye-watering £1,068,370,548 over the course of his career. Portuguese Mendes, 48, a former nightclub owner who became a football agent 18 years ago, has negotiated £208.5 million worth of signings in the last two months alone. Scroll down for video . Jorge Mendes (pictured left) with Radamel Falcao (pictured right) has masterminded transfers worth more than £1bn over the course of his 18-year career as a football agent . With a typical ‘take’ of ten per cent commission per deal, the friend and adviser to Cristiano Ronaldo and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will have pocketed more than £20 million in this summer’s transfer window, and more than £100 million in commissions during his career. That figure doesn’t even take into account his earnings from the £6 million deadline-day loan fee paid by Manchester United to Monaco for striker Radamel Falcao. The transfer could eventually cost United £51.3 million – bringing another big pay day for Mendes. The power broker, who speaks five languages and has four mobile phones, is hailed by Ronaldo as a ‘fair and honest man’ who he trusts ‘completely’. The figure doesn’t even take into account his earnings from the £6 million deadline-day loan fee paid by Manchester United to Monaco for striker Radamel Falcao (pictured right) Mendes oversaw two of the summer’s three biggest transfers – of Angel di Maria from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and James Rodriguez from Monaco to Real Madrid . Chelsea manager Mourinho says Mendes encourages players to ‘respect their commitments’ to clubs, while former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson says Mendes is ‘the best agent I dealt with, without a doubt’. Mendes oversaw two of the summer’s three biggest transfers – of Angel di Maria from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and James Rodriguez from Monaco to Real Madrid. The son of a gas plant worker, Mendes grew up in Lisbon and had a modest career as a semi-professional footballer before running a nightclub and then becoming an agent. He now has 58 names on his client list.","(427, 14)","Jorge Mendes, a well-known Portuguese football agent, has been making waves in the football transfer market recently. In his 18-year career, Mendes has overseen transfers worth a staggering £1bn, and this summer has seen him negotiate deals worth £208.5m in just the last two months alone. These impressive figures do not even include Mendes' earnings from the £6 million loan fee paid by Manchester United to Monaco for the transfer of Radamel Falcao. It's clear that Mendes is a man who knows how to maximise his profits when it comes to transfers. But it's not just about making money for Mendes; he's also masterminded some of the biggest transfers in recent years. His notable clients include Cristiano Ronaldo, Jose Mourinho, and Diego Costa, to name just a few. He's also the man responsible for Angel di Maria's move from Real Madrid to Manchester United, as well as James Rodriguez's transfer from Monaco to Real Madrid. Mendes' influence in the football world is undeniable, so much so that he has been nicknamed ""The Super Agent."" He's a man who knows how to get results and can get top players to sign on the dotted line.  Mendes' success is not just about his business acumen, but also about the strong relationships he's built with clubs and players. His ability to negotiate favourable deals has earned him a reputation as one of the most powerful figures in the football world. Despite his success, there are some who question his motives and whether he has too much power in the sport. Critics argue that his involvement in multiple deals creates a conflict of interest, but Mendes has always maintained that his clients come first. Regardless of any controversy, it's clear that Mendes' influence will continue to be felt in the football world for years to come. His ability to make deals happen and attract top talent makes him an invaluable asset to players and clubs alike, and his reputation as ""The Super Agent"" is unlikely to fade anytime soon.","(382, 15)","Football has its first £1 billion man – but it’s not Beckham, Messi or Ronaldo.

","By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:45 EST, 28 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:20 EST, 29 March 2013 . The Chateau Laroze 2007 has been flying off the shelves of the German supermarket chain . It is not the first place you would think to go for fine wine – but budget store Lidl says it has been overwhelmed with demand for a £19.99 claret. The supermarket, perhaps  better known for discount lager than classy Bordeaux, is stocking a reputable St Emilion Grand Cru as part of a push for affluent  shoppers trying to bag a bargain. The Château Laroze 2007 is the most expensive wine ever sold by the German-owned chain. Lidl’s ‘Wine Cellar’ also includes a 2011 Châteauneuf du Pape at £12.49 and a 2011 Sancerre at £9.99. The wines were chosen by a panel including Master of Wine Richard Bampfield, who gave the Château Laroze an ‘outstanding’ score of 90 out of 100. The . current owners of Château Laroze, an obscure, St. Emilion classified . growth, are the Meslin family, who can trace their roots back to the . Gurchy family, who created the business in 1882, according to the Wine . Cellar Insider website. The 27 hectare Bordeaux vineyard of . Chateau Laroze is planted with 68 per cent Merlot, 26 per cent Cabernet . Franc and 6 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon. In the Chateau Laroze blog, the owner describes the wine as having sex appeal. Guy Meslin wrote in 2009: 'If any wine has sex-appeal, this one does. All the ingredients are melded and in place. 'The wood is nicely blended in and quite flattering, and nicely sets off the very fresh fruity hints. 'The tannins are not especially powerful, but contribute sheer silk and velvet. 'The finish prolongs all this with an emphasis on the aromatic freshness.' The supermarket launched its wine range after realising customers were willing to spend money on the finer things . He said: 'This is a Grand Cru Classé . which means it is at the top of the Bordeaux quality hierarchy and one . has to expect to pay more for it. 'This is very fine, showing the . fragrant aromas of St Emilion, a depth of flavour unusual for the . vintage and a wonderful long finish, the hallmark of a great Bordeaux.' Lidl is alone in selling the Château Laroze 2007 – it is only available from wholesalers otherwise. Lidl increased its share of the groceries market by 10 per cent between October and January. Aldi increased its share by 28 per cent and Iceland by 9.6 per cent over the same period. Ben Hulme, Lidl wine manager, said: .

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Piracy off the coast of Somalia can't be stopped until there is
","WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Piracy off the coast of Somalia can't be stopped until there is some authority to bring pirates to justice, according to the commander of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain. U.S. Vice Admiral William Gortney: Need to hold pirates off Africa's east coast accountable. Because there is no working government in Somalia and no country is willing to take captured pirates, bring them to trial and detain them, there is no deterrent for pirates to stop attacking ships, Vice Admiral William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing Thursday. ""The problem is there's not a way to -- until we have a mechanism [to hold them] accountable and try them for their actions, there's no way to -- to finish the problem,"" Gortney said. The United States is making a deal with a country in the eastern Africa region to hold and try pirates captured by the U.S.-led Combined Task Force 151, a new maritime anti-piracy mission started earlier this month. He said an official announcement would be made after the deal with the country is official. In the past three months, piracy attacks have averaged about 12 to 14 a month off the east coast of Africa. As of mid-January, the attack numbers are already at the average of the past three months, according to Gortney. ""That [number] should tell you that we're not -- we're not being 100 percent successful on the deterrence of the attempt. And that's where we have to go after,"" Gortney said. The United States is expecting other nations to join the anti-piracy task force, but at the moment, the United States is the only country in the task force with just three ships off of the waters of Somalia. There are ships from some European and Asian countries patrolling the waters independently as well, primarily guarding cargo ships from their own countries. Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  See how pirate attacks peaked in 2008 » . Pirating off of Somalia has increased during the past four to five years as fishermen from Somalia realize that pirating is more lucrative than fishing. Additionally, pirates are able to get away with the crimes because of the lack of government and overall lawlessness in the country. Gortney said statistically the chances of ships being pirated off of Somalia less than one percent, but it won't be stopped until piracy is ""disincentivized.""","(477, 17)","The United States Navy remains the only nation with ships dedicated to an anti-pirate task force in the waters surrounding Somalia, according to Admiral William Gortney. Speaking at a recent briefing, the admiral informed reporters that Somalia still ""does not have a working central government"" to deal with piracy issues, leaving other international ships with no official authority to detain and try accused pirates. As a result, the U.S. Navy continues to spearhead the fight against piracy in the region, with other countries supporting the effort through intelligence sharing and occasional patrols. ""We work very closely with our partners, sharing information, and they have ships that ... participate in task force operations when they're in the area,"" said Gortney. However, while the U.S. Navy may be leading the charge, other nations are not sitting idly by. According to Gortney, Asian and European countries have also deployed their own ships to patrol the waters independently. Though they lack the same official authority as the U.S., these vessels can still play a crucial role in deterring piracy and protecting ships passing through the region. Despite these international efforts, piracy remains a persistent problem in the waters off Somalia. Earlier this year, pirates hijacked an oil tanker off the coast, the first such attack in over five years. The ship was eventually released after a ransom was paid, though the incident served as a reminder that piracy is far from eradicated in the area. To combat these attacks, the U.S. Navy has deployed a variety of tactics and technology, including drones, helicopters, and armed security teams aboard vulnerable vessels. However, Gortney issued a reminder that no ship can ever be completely impervious to attack. ""It's not a question of if you'll be attacked, but a question of when,"" he said. As the threat of piracy continues to loom, it's likely that the U.S. Navy will remain a vital component of any anti-piracy efforts in the region. Though other nations may not have the same level of resources or authority, their solidarity and cooperation with the U.S. Navy can help to ensure that the waters off Somalia remain as safe as possible for international shipping.","(411, 15)","WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Piracy off the coast of Somalia can't be stopped until there is
a functioning government in the war-torn country, the top U.S. Navy commander in the
region said Tuesday.
Vice Adm. Bill Gortney, commander of the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, said
Somalia's lack of a central government has made it difficult for the United States and
other nations to work with the country to combat piracy.
""We don't have a government that we can work with,"" Gortney told reporters at the
Pentagon. ""That's one of the biggest challenges.""
Gortney said the United States is the only country with ships dedicated to an
anti-piracy task force in the Gulf of Aden and the waters off the Horn of Africa.
Asian and European nations have their own ships patrolling the region, but they are
independent of the U.S.-led task force, Gortney said.
Gortney said he would like to see other nations join the U.S. task force, but he
acknowledged that may not be possible.
""I'd like to see them join us,"" Gortney said. ""I don't know if that's going to
happen or not, but I'd like to see that happen.""
Gortney also said the United States will continue to use military force to stop
piracy in the region, but he acknowledged that the problem cannot be solved through
military means alone.
""We're going to continue to do what we're doing,"" he said. ""It's not going to be
solved militarily. It's going to be solved politically.""
Gortney's comments come as the United States and other nations are stepping up
efforts to combat piracy in the region.
Last week, the U.S. Navy seized a suspected pirate mother ship in the Gulf of
Aden. The seizure was the latest in a series of U.S. actions against piracy in the
region.
The United States has also been working with other nations to develop a plan to
combat piracy in the region. The plan, which is expected to be finalized in the next
few weeks, will include a mix of military and non-military measures to combat piracy,
Gortney said.
In addition to the United States, several other nations have ships patrolling the
region, including China, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea. However, these ships
are not part of a coordinated effort to combat piracy, and they often operate
independently of each other.
The lack of a coordinated effort has made it difficult to effectively combat piracy
in the region, according to Gortney.
""We need to have a more coordinated approach,"" he said.
Despite the challenges, Gortney remains optimistic that piracy in the region can be
stopped.
""I'm confident that we can get this under control,"" he said.
However, he acknowledged that it will take time and effort to achieve this goal.
""It's not going to happen overnight,"" he said.","(557, 27)","WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Piracy off the coast of Somalia can't be stopped until there is

","There's no ""Hey, baby, what's your sign?"" button. But if you have a friend with a mysteriously undefined love life, Facebook may have just become a little more like a singles bar at closing time. A new ""Ask"" feature lets you ping friends who haven't set their Relationship Status and ask them what's up. Facebook has been quietly rolling out the feature for testing in select countries, including the United States. Clicking on ""Ask"" brings up a dialogue box with the text, ""Let (your friend) know why you're asking for (his/her) relationship status."" It provides space to expand upon your request -- say, to invite them out for drinks. A Facebook spokeswoman said that similar ""Ask"" buttons have been available on mobile and Web for a few months for other profile information. ""This feature provides an easy way for friends to ask you for information that's not already on your profile,"" Facebook spokeswoman MoMo Zhou said in an e-mail. ""For example, a friend could ask where you work or for your hometown. If you choose to answer, this information is then added to your profile. By default, only you and your friend can see it, and you also have the option of sharing it with others, too."" Well, that sounds a little less like an overture from someone who's hitting on you. Or for that matter, a Poke. And, yes, even the relationship-status version presumably will have non-stalkery applications. A friend just checking in. Someone who was at your wedding and offering a gentle reminder for you to update your page. Or ... you know ... your mom, who remains convinced you're just not trying hard enough to find Mr. or Ms. Right. As noted, a user may reply to the person who sent the request without updating their status, though they are given an opportunity to do so. And it's surely not lost on Facebook that relationship status is a handy piece of information for advertisers trying to target their ads. Still, some commenters on Twitter found the new feature a little ... creepy. ""Are you single or taken? Facebook now lets you ask someone out in the most awkward way possible,"" said Ali Mostofian.","(440, 24)","Facebook has recently added a new feature to its platform, allowing users to inquire about their friends' relationships, job, or hometown.

The ""Ask"" feature provides users with a discreet and easy way to inquire about their friends' personal lives without needing to ask directly. Only friends on the platform can inquire, and the receiver of the inquiry may choose to reply privately, allowing for a more comfortable dialogue between friends.  Facebook's latest feature is poised to be a hit with a younger audience who are notorious for being curious about their friend's personal lives. The feature will also likely benefit those who are shy or uncomfortable asking their friends directly about personal topics. To utilize the feature, all a user has to do is click on the ""Ask"" button next to their friend's empty information field. The friend will be notified and can choose to respond privately to the inquiry. This feature will help users build stronger relationships with their friends and keep them updated on important life events. The ""Ask"" feature can also be used to inquire about a friend's job or hometown. For example, if a user notices that their friend has not filled out their job title, the user can click the ""Ask"" button and kindly inquire about their friend's occupation. Similarly, if a user sees that their friend's hometown is blank, they can click ""Ask"" and inquire about their friend's place of origin.

While the ""Ask"" feature may seem like a harmless way to learn more about your
friends, it's important to remember that anything you post on Facebook can be seen
by anyone. So if you're not comfortable sharing certain information, it's best to
leave it off your profile. And if you do decide to use the ""Ask"" button, be sure to
think carefully about what you're asking and why.","There's no ""Hey, baby, what's your sign?"" button. But if you have a friend with
a Facebook account, you can now ask them about their relationship status.
Facebook has added a new feature called ""Ask,"" which lets users inquire about
their friends' relationships.
""Ask"" appears next to information that isn't filled out, and only friends can
inquire.
Users can also ask about their friends' jobs or hometowns.
Facebook says the new feature is designed to make it easier for users to get
the information they want from their friends.
""We've heard from people that they want to know more about their friends, but
they don't always know how to ask,"" Facebook said in a blog post. ""So we're
making it easier for people to get the information they're looking for from
their friends.""
The new feature is part of Facebook's ongoing effort to make the social
networking site more user-friendly. Earlier this year, the company added a
""Like"" button, which allows users to express their approval of a post or
comment.
Facebook also recently introduced a feature that allows users to ""poke"" their
friends, which is similar to ""poking"" someone in real life.
The new features are part of a larger effort by Facebook to make the site more
user-friendly. The company has been criticized in the past for making it
difficult for users to find information on the site.
Facebook is also working on a new feature that will allow users to search for
friends based on their location. The feature is currently in beta testing, and
is expected to be rolled out to all users in the coming months.","(280, 12)","(323, 16)"

(CNN)Silicon Valley was once the only place to be for the world's hippest tech firms.
","(CNN)Silicon Valley was once the only place to be for the world's hippest tech firms. It's the region that gave birth to all-conquering behemoths like Google and Apple, after all. But fast forward to 2015 and the playground of global technology has moved roughly 60 kilometers (37 miles) north to San Francisco. ""Information is the new currency and that currency is gushing through the streets of San Francisco,"" said Alan Collenette, regional managing director of real estate firm Colliers International. According to Collenette, firms like Twitter are relocating to the City by the Bay because it offers a more attractive lifestyle to talented employees. ""If you're in your 20s (or) 30s, you want to live in a vibrant environment where you're surrounded by like-minded people. Where there's a lot of interesting cultural stuff to do,"" Collenette said. ""And with the great respect to the suburbs where Apple was born, there's a lot more cultural diversity and a lot more to do (in San Francisco) than there is there. Last year, commercial real estate in San Francisco was snapped up in large parcels. As many as 14 different companies signed leases for more than 9,000 square meters (97,000 square feet) worth of space and property. Among those leasing were tech heavyweights like Pinterest and Trulia. ""Now in 2015, 60% of all leases done in San Francisco are for technology companies,"" Collenette said. ""28% of the top space users who occupy more than 250, 000 square feet are technology users. That's up from 8% in the dotcom boom. That's how dramatic the shift's been."" These cash-rich tech firms are also changing the game by shying away from the offices of yesterday. Beer taps, foosball tables, and bike racks are now the norm at offices in the city. Primo Orpilla has seen the change first hand while designing spaces for the likes of crowd-sourced company review platform, Yelp, and taxi app, Uber. ""The offices of just three or four years ago, they're definitely more hierarchically set up,"" Orpilla said. ""You had fewer conference rooms, a lot of the work stations went to the middle. What we're seeing now, we're basically wanting to share that space. Share the light, flatten the organization."" Orpilla adds that old warehouses with high ceilings in the South of Market District have become particularly popular. But demand has driven prices up with rates climbing for both commercial and residential properties. In a city that spans just seven by seven square miles space will eventually run out. For now though, the outlook is rosy for those riding the tech wave. ""There has never been a time when the world's economy depended so much on the ideas and the work product that come out of one location,"" said Collenette. ""It's the golden age, this is an era that's just beginning and the light isn't just shining on San Francisco for a brief moment in time. I firmly believe this is going to last long into the future.""","(596, 29)","In recent years, San Francisco has become a tech hub, attracting some of the world's biggest tech firms. The dire need for office space in this city has led to a significant increase in commercial property development, with real estate firms providing modern workplace designs that suit the needs of tech companies. According to reports, 14 different tech companies signed leases for more than 97,000 square feet worth of space in the city in 2014 alone. This is a testimony to the growing trend of tech companies setting up offices in San Francisco, drawn to the diverse talent pool, vibrant culture, and convenient location. It is no surprise that tech firms are choosing San Francisco as their base of operation. The city has a wealth of resources, including top universities, and a talented youth population. This attracts start-ups and such giants as Google, Apple, and Facebook to set up shop in the city. San Francisco offers many advantages that draw tech firms to the city. The incredible public transit options are a significant plus, as most tech employees prefer environmentally friendly transport modes to work. Renting, leasing, or buying commercial space or property is more accessible than other cities, meaning start-ups can set up shop more easily. The excellent work and life balance offered by San Francisco is very enticing for tech employees, with city life, nature, and cultural offerings available in easy reach. Real estate firms functioning in San Francisco are offering unique, modern office designs that fit the needs of tech firms. In the past, many offices were closed and cramped, but there has been a transformation in commercial properties with open workspaces and playful designs that foster creativity, collaboration, and an enjoyable work environment. Tech companies from Silicon Valley are expanding into San Francisco to ensure access to a diverse talent pool. Start-ups and growing companies in San Francisco offer an appealing opportunity to enter the global marketplace. As a result, the city is morphing into a global business capital, with many international companies setting up offices in San Francisco. According to a recent report by CBRE, a Commercial Real Estate Company, commercial real estate spending in San Francisco was more than $2.5 billion in the first half of 2019. This rise in property development in San Francisco has been facilitated by the thriving tech sector, resulting in a massive economic boost for the city. In conclusion, San Francisco is a thriving tech hub that attracts the world's biggest tech firms. The diverse workforce, vibrant culture, convenient location, and fantastic talent pool have made it the clear choice for the tech industry's expansion. Real estate companies are responding to the needs of tech companies by creating innovative workspaces designed to promote creativity, collaboration, and vibrant work environments. San Francisco's status as a tech capital is only set to grow in the coming years, making it a city of opportunity for tech firms and entrepreneurs.","(549, 22)","(CNN)Silicon Valley was once the only place to be for the world's hippest tech firms.

(CNN) -- An asteroid the size of an aircraft carrier passed within the moon's orbit
","(CNN) -- An asteroid the size of an aircraft carrier passed within the moon's orbit Tuesday, the closest approach by an object that large in more than 30 years. Asteroid 2005 YU55 passed within 202,000 miles of Earth -- about four-fifths of the distance to the moon -- at 6:28 p.m. Tuesday, NASA said. Marina Brozovic, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said the space agency was able to train a great deal of high-powered instruments -- including the massive radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico -- on the asteroid as it approached. ""This is a rare event, and we learned a lot,"" Brozovic told CNN. Follow space and science news on Light Years . Though the space agency classified the asteroid as a ""potentially hazardous object,"" it posed no threat of a collision, according to NASA's Near Earth Object Program. If the asteroid had crashed into Earth, it could have caused a 4,000-megaton blast and a magnitude 7.0 earthquake, according to scientists at Purdue University. If it fell into the ocean, it could have caused a 70-foot-high tsunami within 60 miles of the crash site, the experts said. The last time a space rock in the same league as 2005 YU55 passed as close to Earth was in 1976, NASA said. The next similar encounter is projected for 2028, Brozovic said. Podcast: Asteroid close encounter . As the object neared Earth, NASA studied the asteroid with the Goldstone radar antennas in California's Mojave Desert. Goldstone antennas are very sensitive radio telescopes used to investigate quasars, radar mapping of planets and comets. Scientists plan to reconstruct the shape of the asteroid with a resolution as fine as 13 feet (4 meters) using the antennas. Share your view of the asteroid . The approach also provides a rare opportunity for amateur astronomers to directly observe an asteroid with optical telescopes. But because the object is so dark, NASA said stargazers would need a telescope with an aperture of 6 inches (15cm) or larger to see it. ""It's visible across North America in the ensuing hours, dim at 11th or 12th magnitude and moving fast,"" Sky & Telescope magazine said. CNN's Sean Morris contributed to this report.","(423, 19)","On Tuesday, asteroid 2005 YU55 passed within a relatively close distance of Earth, coming within 202,000 miles. While this might seem concerning, NASA promptly announced that there was no risk of a collision with the planet.  ""This is a rare event, and we learned a lot,"" one researcher said about the asteroid. Indeed, the close approach gave astronomers a unique opportunity to study the object up close. The asteroid is about 1,300 feet wide and is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid. However, despite its classification, there was never any danger of it hitting Earth on this occasion. NASA was closely monitoring the asteroid's trajectory as it approached Earth. One of their biggest assets in this regard was the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex, which captured radar images of the asteroid as it passed by. Scientists were able to learn a great deal from these images, studying features of the asteroid's surface in detail. Despite the excitement around the asteroid's close approach, NASA was careful to emphasize that there was no danger of it colliding with Earth. ""Asteroid 2005 YU55 poses no threat of an Earth collision over, at the very least, the next 100 years,"" said Don Yeomans of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office. While the asteroid's trajectory is not a threat to the planet, it is nevertheless being closely monitored by astronomers. 2005 YU55 passes Earth regularly - about every 14 years - and each time it does, scientists have a chance to learn more about it. Even though it wasn't in direct danger of a collision, the asteroid's close approach was still a rare and fascinating event that many astronomers will study for years to come. In conclusion, while asteroid 2005 YU55 made a close pass by Earth on Tuesday, there was never any danger of a collision with the planet. NASA used the opportunity to study the object up close, including taking radar images of its surface. While it remains classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid, there is no foreseeable threat of it colliding with Earth in the next 100 years.","(394, 17)","(CNN) -- An asteroid the size of an aircraft carrier passed within the moon's orbit

passed within 201,700 miles of Earth at 6:28 p.m. ET, according to NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. That's about 0.85 times the distance

Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the sun. They range in size from a few feet
across to more than 600 miles in diameter. Most asteroids reside in the main asteroid
belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but some come close enough to Earth to
be classified as near-Earth objects, or NEOs.
Yeomans said the asteroid will make its closest approach to Earth on November 8,
2011, when it will be about 324,600 miles away. That's about one and a half times
the distance between Earth and the moon.
The asteroid poses no threat of hitting Earth for at least the next 100 years,
Yeomans said. In fact, it won't get this close to Earth again for another 200 years,
he said.
The asteroid was discovered in December 2005 by astronomers at the Catalina Sky
Survey near Tucson, Arizona. Since then, scientists have been able to track its
orbit around the sun and determine that it poses no threat to Earth for at least
the next 100 years, Yeomans said.
The asteroid is traveling at about 29,000 miles per hour relative to Earth, Yeomans
said. At that speed, it would take the asteroid about 11 minutes to cross the United
States from coast to coast, he said.
Yeomans likened the asteroid to an aircraft carrier, which is typically about 1,000
feet long and 250 feet wide. He said the asteroid is about five times larger than
the Chelyabinsk meteorite that exploded over Russia in February 2013, injuring more
than 1,000 people and damaging thousands of buildings.

Pleaded for help: Prosecutors say Willie Robinson begged his mother and father to take him to the doctor . Preventable: Willie, 8, died of Hodgkin's lymphoma, which has a 96 percent survivability rate, if properly treated . But prosecutors say as Willie was . dying a horrible, but preventable, death, Hussing and Robinson paid $87 . to take their pit bull Petey to a veterinarian and have it treated for . fleas. After ignoring . his pleas for medical help, Willie collapsed at their home March 22, . 2008. It was then Hussing and Robinson finally took him to the hospital, . where he was diagnosed with cancer and died later that day. The coroner ruled his death, caused by cancer and pneumonia, a homicide, meaning it was the result of his parents' actions. Authorities say none of the couple's five other children, now 17, 16, 10, 9 and 8, received medical care. All of them have been removed from their parents and are living with an aunt. The parents also kept their children out of school. Willie never saw a the inside of a classroom in his short life, authorities say. Hogkin's Lymphoma is cancer of lymph tissue found in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver and bone marrow. Symptoms include: fatigue, fever and chills, loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss. It is the most common form of childhood cancer and the most treatable, with up to 96 percent of children surviving at least five years after the cancer goes into remission.","(584, 35)","Willie Robinson, a young boy in California, passed away from Hodgkin's Lymphoma in 2008. However, the circumstances surrounding his illness and treatment have recently come into question in court. According to prosecutors, Robinson's parents spent $87 on treating their pet dog Petey for fleas while their son was gravely ill. The prosecution alleges that Robinson's parents neglected to properly care for their son while diverting funds towards their beloved pet. The case has brought attention to the ethical complexities surrounding pet ownership in the face of serious health concerns. The family's lawyer, however, argues that the parents did everything in their power to care for their son but were simply unable to afford the necessary medical treatment. The funds spent on Petey's flea treatment amounted to a minor expense in the grand scheme of things. Regardless of the outcome of the case, it raises important questions about the prioritization of different forms of life. While it is natural for people to feel a strong attachment to their pets, serious illnesses like Hodgkin's Lymphoma require undivided attention and resources. Willie Robinson's death was a tragic loss for his family and community. Hodgkin's Lymphoma is a form of cancer that attacks the immune system and can have devastating effects if left untreated. The case highlights the importance of timely and effective medical care for those suffering from serious illnesses. In addition to the legal proceedings, there has been widespread public debate on the role of pets in our lives. Many argue that pets are an important part of our families and provide emotional support during difficult times. However, this sentiment is not universally shared, and some feel that pet ownership can distract from more pressing matters, especially when it comes to the health of loved ones. The Robinson case has brought these debates to the forefront, sparking conversations around the ethical implications of pet ownership and the proper allocation of resources. It is clear that there are no easy answers, but increasing awareness of these issues is an important step towards fostering a more thoughtful and compassionate society. In the end, Willie Robinson's legacy will be of a young boy whose life was tragically cut short by a devastating disease. While the circumstances leading up to his death may be controversial, it is important to remember that every life is precious and deserving of the best medical care possible. This case serves as a reminder of the difficult choices that families face when it comes to the health and wellbeing of their loved ones, both human and animal.","(473, 20)","A couple who failed to seek medical care for their cancer-stricken son because they said

By . Olivia Williams . This sporty goldfish is not afraid of hitting the back
","By . Olivia Williams . This sporty goldfish is not afraid of hitting the back of the net after being taught to play football like a pro. Span the footballing fish can deftly nudge a submerged ball along the bottom of its tank into a Subbuteo goal. Owner Peter Bettison, 80, has used an intensive training course to teach the talented fish how to score every time. Scroll down for video . Limbering up: Span fixes its eye on the goal in its tank in Devon, where it has been practising with coach and owner 80-year-old Peter Bettison . Swooping in: Span the footballing fish maintains its concentration as it nears the miniature goal . Tense moment: The ball looks as though it may hit the post at the last minute . It can also play netball, swim through rings and limbo under tiny bars in his tank - that comes complete with a miniature football pitch. Mr Bettison, of Exeter, Devon, honed Span's skills after sending off for a specialist fish training manual. He rewards the young shoal-scorer with a nugget of food every time it hits the net - similar to the 'positive reinforcement' method used to teach tricks to dolphins. Peter bought four-year-old Span - named after football legend Sir Stanley Matthews - in 2010 as a present for his wife Sheila who was in hospital. Crunch time: Span watches the ball rolling past the post . It scores: Span proudly watches the ball land safely in the net after months of hard training . He said: 'Basically you start gradually . using a reward system - a bit like footballers' pay but fish food for it . - to encourage the fish to first swim through a ring. 'Then gradually you work up to a six-inch tube for the fish to swim through, horizontal, then vertical. 'Then there is the limbo where it swims under a bar and finally you introduce the ball which is plastic and doesn't float. Unlikely footballer: Although Span does not have a streamlined body, it makes a surprisingly effective striker . Pride and Joy: Peter Bettison from Exeter with his talented fish . 'It has taken to it really well and seems to enjoy scoring goals. People say goldfish are not very bright and have no memory. 'What is slightly odd is that its is not built like an athlete, more like a swimming tennis ball.' Peter now uses the fish's skills to raise money for Hospiscare. Practice pitch: Span is able to put in hours of training with a scaled-down pitch that fits in its tank . Multi-talented: Not only can Span handle a football with skill, it can also play netball, swim through hoops and limbo thanks to Mr Bettison's guidance .","(507, 28)","In a world where humans are not alone in their love for sports, there is an extraordinary goldfish named Span who has become quite the athlete. Span, a four-year-old goldfish, has been named after one of the greatest football legends of all time, Sir Stanley Matthews.  Span's owner, Samantha, has been training the tiny fish to play a range of sports over the years. And to her astonishment, her efforts have paid off as Span is now able to shoot and score in its tank like a true pro. Samantha credits the intensive training that she has given to Span, including teaching the fish how to play netball, swimming through rings and even limbo under tiny bars.  Samantha revealed that Span's training began when the fish was just a few months old. At that time, Samantha saw how active and curious Span was and decided to harness that energy by teaching it various sports. Samantha started by placing small hoops and other toys in the tank to keep Span entertained. Eventually, Samantha began to notice that Span had started to perfect its skills and was ready for more complex training sessions.  Over time, Samantha introduced competitive elements to Span's training, which has helped the fish to develop its shooting ability. Samantha has even set up a series of obstacles to train Span to become more agile and dexterous, with the ultimate goal of turning the fish into a true all-rounder. Samantha explained that she has seen a marked improvement in Span's abilities across all sports. She believes that the training has not only stimulated the fish's cognitive abilities but also provided it with emotional needs that might have been absent if Span had remained in a bare tank.  Span has now become more than just a pet, but a true member of the family. Samantha said that she feels lucky to have such an intelligent and talented pet, and that it has been a joy to watch him develop over the years.  As news of Span's talents start to spread, Samantha has been inundated with messages from people who were amazed by the incredible fish's abilities. Many have asked for tips on how to train their own pets, with some even suggesting that Span should have its own YouTube channel or even a TV show. As for Samantha, she plans to continue the training with Span and is excited to see just what other remarkable accomplishments her goldfish can achieve. For now, Span is content playing sports in its mini tank while millions of people around the world watch in awe.","(477, 19)","By. Olivia Williams.

The heart-stopping moment when two men leap across New York subway platforms has been captured
","The heart-stopping moment when two men leap across New York subway platforms has been captured on video and uploaded to YouTube. The unidentified daredevils were on what appears to be an empty platform when they carried out the dangerous stunt. The life-risking jumps took place at the 9th Avenue and 39st stop in Brooklyn on the D line. Scroll down for video . In line of danger: A young man makes the risky decision of jumping over a subway stop platform in Brooklyn . Foolish: Two men risked their lives by jumping across subway platforms in Brooklyn, New York . The two men, who appear to be in their late teens or early twenties, begin the jump by standing at the very edge of the opposite platform which also opens on to a live track. The first boy runs at the gap and leaps across, landing heavily on the edge before taking a tumble towards the track on the other side. He is followed by his friend who has a similarly nerve-wracking close call all the while being filmed by a cameraman who can be heard howling with laughter over music. Life on the edge: One of the duo almost loses his balance and topples into the tracks on the New York subway . Challenge: The other jumper perches on the far away platform so he can have a good run at the track . The two boys then run off up the stairs on the opposite side. The video was posted on YouTube this weekend and has already attracted a host of negative comments about the dangerous antics. In April, horrifying footage was also posted online of a group of youths playing chicken with a subway train moments before it pulled into a Brooklyn station. Escape route: Laughing and running away, the two young men escape the near empty station . The Metropolitan Transport Authority condemned the stunt, saying that hundreds of people were seriously injured by subway trains every year. 'Playing on or near subway tracks is one of the most dangerous things anyone can do,' a MTA spokesman said. 'And while you can't outlaw stupidity you have to remember that 146 people were struck by subway trains last year and 47 of them died as a result.'","(408, 18)","The New York City subway system is known for its hustle, bustle and congestion, but a viral video posted on YouTube has caught the attention of many as it shows two individuals leaping over the tracks at a Brooklyn subway station.

The video has since gone viral and has been shared across various social media sites. The clip shows the two individuals running across the platform, before jumping over the tracks and landing back on the platform on the other side. It’s a moment that is both thrilling and also dangerous, given the potential risks involved in jumping across the subway tracks. The video has sparked a lot of conversation online, with many condemning the actions of the two individuals. Subway riders have expressed their concerns about the safety risks of pulling a stunt like this in a public place, not only for the stunt performers themselves but also for the safety of other commuters.  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which oversees the city's subway system, has released a statement condemning the incident and warning others against copying such dangerous things. The statement said, ""We strongly discourage anyone from attempting anything like this. Not only is it illegal, but it is also extremely dangerous and can cause major disruption to the subway service."" It's unclear from the video whether the individuals were arrested for their actions, but the MTA has said that they are investigating the incident. Since the video was posted, several other copycat videos have emerged, prompting a reminder from the subway officials to the public to not attempt such dangerous stunts on subway tracks. The MTA has released a statement urging subway riders to enforce safety rules and report any suspicious activity on the subway. Other subway riders have been advised to keep an eye out for anything suspicious and report their concerns to the authorities immediately.

not known if they were passengers on the train or if they were simply bystanders who were
caught up in the excitement of the moment. However, the incident has once again highlighted
the dangers of using the subway system, which is one of the busiest in the world.
Despite the dangers, the subway system remains a vital form of transportation for millions of
people in New York City. The MTA has implemented a number of safety measures in recent
years, including the installation of security cameras and the deployment of additional police
officers. However, these measures have not been enough to prevent incidents like the one that
occurred on Wednesday.
The incident has also sparked a debate about the safety of the subway system. Some people
argue that the system is too dangerous and that more needs to be done to protect passengers.
Others argue that the system is generally safe and that incidents like the one on Wednesday are
rare. Whatever the case may be, it is clear that the incident has captured the attention of people

The identity of the two men who leapt across the subway tracks has not yet been revealed. It is
not known if they were passengers on the train or if they were simply bystanders who were
caught up in the excitement of the moment. However, the incident has once again highlighted
the dangers of using the subway system, which is one of the busiest in the world.
Despite the dangers, the subway system remains a vital form of transportation for millions of
people in New York City. The MTA has implemented a number of safety measures in recent
years, including the installation of security cameras and the deployment of additional police
officers. However, these measures have not been enough to prevent incidents like the one that
occurred on Wednesday.
The incident has also sparked a debate about the safety of the subway system. Some people
argue that the system is too dangerous and that more needs to be done to protect passengers.
Others argue that the system is generally safe and that incidents like the one on Wednesday are
rare. Whatever the case may be, it is clear that the incident has captured the attention of people
around the world and has raised important questions about the safety of public transportation.","The heart-stopping moment when two men leap across New York subway platforms has been captured

President Barack Obama underwent a routine CT scan Saturday afternoon while visiting Walter Reed National
","President Barack Obama underwent a routine CT scan Saturday afternoon while visiting Walter Reed National Military Medical Center because of a sore throat, according to the White House and his doctor. The president's doctor said the CT scan was normal and that Obama's symptoms ""are consistent with soft tissue inflammation related to acid reflux."" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the President was not sedated, so no transfer of authority was necessary. However, Vice President Joe Biden and other senior White House staffers ""were kept up to speed,"" Earnest said. The doctor's visit was not on the White House schedule for Saturday and reporters hustled to join the president's motorcade to Water Reed in Bethesda, Maryland. The president left the hospital 28 minutes after arriving. Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, Obama's physician, issued a statement: . ""This morning, an ear, nose and throat specialist from Fort Belvoir Medical Center conducted a fiber optic exam, under my supervision, of the President's throat based on symptoms of sore throat over the past couple weeks. The exam revealed soft tissue swelling in the posterior throat and I, in consultation with the specialist, determined that further evaluation with a routine CT scan was prudent. ""The CT scan was conducted this afternoon purely as a matter of convenience for the President's schedule. The CT scan was normal. The President's symptoms are consistent with soft tissue inflammation related to acid reflux and will be treated accordingly."" CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said acid reflux usually can be easily treated. ""A lot of times, it may just be dietary changes,"" he said. ""Sometimes, you want to give medicines to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach."" Gupta said he thought the CT scan was done ""out of an abundance of caution."" ""They brought in an ears, nose and throat doctor into the White House and placed a scope down the mouth and looking at  the back of throat to see what was causing his discomfort,"" he said. ""Typically, you just do that by sort of putting an anesthetic spray in the back of the throat, sometimes a sedation as well. ... Based on what they found there, they were concerned enough to go ahead and get a CT scan."" Asked whether the President is still smoking, Earnest replied that Obama quit with the assistance of nicotine gum. Obama visited Jackson for his periodic checkup in May. Jackson described Obama's overall health as ""excellent."" The checkup information, released in June,  was the third medical report released by the White House during Obama's presidency.","(503, 23)","Former President Barack Obama recently visited the Walter Reed Medical Center for a sore throat. Concerns arose that he might be suffering from a serious illness or an urgent medical condition. However, the former president's doctor has confirmed that he is not sedated and that there is no need to transfer authority to someone else. The medical report indicates that Obama's ""symptoms are consistent with soft tissue inflammation related to acid reflux."" He initially received treatment for this condition on his own, but his sore throat persisted. As a result, his doctor ordered a CT scan, which came back completely normal.  The former president was admitted to the military hospital ""to consult with the ENT doctor regarding further treatment options for his symptoms,"" his spokesperson said in a statement. He was then released after a brief examination. Obama still maintains an active lifestyle and frequently travels around the world for speaking engagements and other activities. He has always been careful about his health and has a regular exercise regimen that he follows.  Many fans of the former president expressed their concerns on social media when reports of his medical visit surfaced. However, the medical report assures that he is in good health and there is no need for alarm. Despite his doctor's advice to rest, Obama is expected to continue with his scheduled public appearances in the coming days. He is even scheduled to attend an event with his wife Michelle Obama on Tuesday.  Obama remains a popular figure in American politics and his health is of great concern to many. His visit to Walter Reed Medical Center has been widely reported, but the medical report confirms that there is no reason to worry. In conclusion, former President Barack Obama visited Walter Reed Medical Center for a sore throat, and his doctor confirmed that he is in good health.

Ben Stokes put his World Cup disappointment to one side to help England Lions draw
","Ben Stokes put his World Cup disappointment to one side to help England Lions draw first blood in their unofficial one-day international series with South Africa A. The Durham all-rounder was controversially omitted from the national side's 15-man squad for the showpiece event in Australia and New Zealand, but responded by taking four for 22 in Bloemfontein as the hosts were all out for 172 after being asked to bat first. Stokes then contributed a valuable 31 with the bat before Samit Patel and Liam Plunkett put on an unbroken 39-run stand as the Lions won by four wickets. Ben Stokes during the England Lions' first One Day International against South Africa A in Bloemfontein . Stokes was one of five players to join the Lions following the drawn unofficial Test series against the same opponents, and he made an immediate impression on Sunday. After Harry Gurney and Boyd Rankin had made early inroads, Stokes struck with his first ball as Dean Elgar thumped to mid-off to depart for 21. Theunis de Bruyn made 19 before a top-edged pull gave Stokes his second wicket, while Justin Ontong was caught behind off Plunkett as the hosts fell to 88 for five. Wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow (left) celebrates with his team-mates as Harry Gurney (right) bowls a delivery . Dane Vilas and David Wiese put on 56 to stage a mini-recovery but the latter was caught behind off Gurney for 18 and the tail folded quickly. Wiese top-scored with 39 but his counter-attacking innings came to an end when he thumped to mid-off off Stokes, who cleaned up last man Marchant de Lange as the hosts were bowled out in 39.3 overs. Jason Roy and Alex Lees made a decent start in reply, putting on 43 for the opening wicket. Dane Vilas (pictured) and David Wiese put on 56 for the hosts but could not prevent a four wicket defeat . But Lees was dismissed for 12 while Lions captain James Vince made a duck as he was caught behind off De Lange, who had Roy lbw to end an entertaining innings of 41 off 44 balls. That left England wobbling on 67 for three and that became 88 for four when Jonny Bairstow edged Wiese to slip. Stokes restored some semblance of calm with a resolute 31 off 50 balls although he and Sam Billings departed before the Lions reached their victory target. Patel and Plunkett (22no) settled quickly, though, with the latter launching Eddie Leie for the first six of the match. Patel (17no) then struck the winning runs in the 35th over to give the Lions a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. Boyd Rankin takes a catch during England Lions' opening ODI victory over South Africa A on Sunday .","(497, 18)","Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes was overlooked from England's final 15-man team for the upcoming ODI World Cup. However, he doesn't seem to be letting that affect his game as he put on an impressive performance for the England Lions against South Africa A. Stokes came in with England Lions batting at 76 for 5 during the first one-day match at Canterbury. He hit a quick-fire 31 runs off 24 balls to take the team's total to 206 for 9. But it was his performance with the ball that really stood out. Stokes took four wickets for just 22 runs as he dismantled South Africa A's middle-order. His spell allowed England Lions to bowl out their opponents for just 172, securing a four-wicket victory. Stokes' performance will surely raise questions about his World Cup omission. He remains one of England's key all-rounders and has proven his worth time and again in both domestic and international cricket. Nonetheless, the selectors have opted for other options for the World Cup. The England Lions' win was a welcome one after they had lost their previous two T20 games against Pakistan A. The team showed good spirit and determination on the field, and will be hoping to continue their winning momentum in the next one-day game. South Africa A, on the other hand, will be left to rue missed opportunities. Their batting faltered against Stokes' lethal bowling, and their bowlers struggled to make significant inroads against the England Lions lineup. They will need to regroup quickly if they are to avoid a similar result in the next game. The England ODI World Cup squad announcement was made earlier this week, and it surprised many to see Stokes omitted from the squad. The selectors instead opted for the likes of Jofra Archer and Liam Plunkett as fast-bowling options. Stokes' absence will undoubtedly be a blow to the team, but they still have a strong batting and bowling lineup. England, as hosts, are one of the favorites to lift the trophy this year. Led by Eoin Morgan, the team will have their sights set on their first-ever ODI World Cup triumph. They have a number of talented players in their squad and will be hoping to peak at the right time. The one-day series between the England Lions and South Africa A will provide valuable game time for both teams ahead of the World Cup. It will also give Stokes and other omitted players the chance to prove their worth and potentially force their way back into the squad. The next game of the series takes place on May 23 at Blackfinch New Road.","(481, 23)","Ben Stokes put his World Cup disappointment to one side to help England Lions draw

(CNN) -- Thousands of people were evacuated from the coast of southern Spain on Friday
","(CNN) -- Thousands of people were evacuated from the coast of southern Spain on Friday as a wildfire menaced the wealthy resort town of Marbella, local authorities said. About 4,000 people were evacuated from the village of Ojen and an additional 2,000 people from the eastern part of Marbella, said Maria Jose Figueira, a spokeswoman for Marbella's government. The fire has been brought under control in Marbella but continues to rage out of control north of Marbella near Ojen and Coin, Figueira said. At least one person is feared dead after a charred body, thought to be that of an elderly man, was found in Ojen, she told CNN. An injured German couple has been admitted to the Carlos Haya Hospital in Malaga, she added. The wildfire started Thursday in Coin, to the north of Marbella, Figueira said. It was at its most intense at noon Friday near the villages of Ojen, Coin and Monda, Spain's Efe news agency reported. A racetrack in Marbella and a sports center in the Monda area have been set up as shelters for those forced to leave their homes, the news agency said. However, those previously ordered to leave their homes in Marbella can now return, Figueira said. The Costa del Sol, in Spain's Andalucia region, is popular with visitors for its Mediterranean beaches and sunshine, and is home to large numbers of expatriates, particularly from Britain. The UK Foreign Office said it was working with Spanish authorities. ""We estimate that several hundred British nationals have been evacuated, including some 300 who have been relocated to evacuation centers in the La Cala de Mijas and Calahonda areas,"" a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. Marbella, studded with luxurious villas, is known as a destination for the rich and famous. Monda and Ojen lie in the foothills of the Sierra de las Nieves, a mountainous area designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1995, according to the Costa del Sol Tourist Board.

The blaze broke out last Thursday to the north of the resort town and has been burning out of control for several days. Local authorities have confirmed that one charred body has been found and two people have been injured in the inferno. The cause of the fire is not yet clear, although officials believe that it may have been started accidentally. Strong winds and dry conditions in the region have helped the blaze to spread quickly, making it difficult for firefighters to bring it under control. Residents and tourists have been forced to flee their homes and hotels, seeking refuge in emergency shelters set up by the local authorities. Many have expressed concern for their safety, as the fire rages on and continues to spread. Despite the efforts of firefighters to contain the blaze, it has already caused significant damage to the local environment. Thick smoke has filled the air, making it difficult for drivers to see and causing respiratory problems for some people. Local authorities have urged people to stay away from the affected area and to avoid unnecessary travel. They have also called for patience and understanding from those who have been forced to evacuate, assuring them that everything possible is being done to bring the fire under control and ensure their safety. The Marbella area of the Costa del Sol is a popular destination for tourists from all over the world. Its beaches, restaurants, and nightlife attract millions of visitors each year, making it an important source of revenue for the local economy. However, the current forest fire is likely to have a significant impact on the region's tourism industry.

","By . Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 15:30 EST, 7 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:15 EST, 8 February 2013 . Hurtling down a mountain track on a mountain bike, with sheer drops awaiting careless riders, is a terrifying and thrilling way to spend your free time. But it's not adrenaline-fuelled enough for German extreme sports enthusiast Lutz Eichholz, who instead takes to some of the world's most rugged terrain on a unicycle. The 26-year-old, who has been unicycing since he was just nine, is a pioneer of extreme mountain unicycling and has travelled the world to indulge in his heart-stopping hobby. Scroll down for video . Eichholz pauses to survey the terrain before cycling his way down the Dolomite Mountains in Italy . Mr Eichholz, who is often joined by his friend Stephanie Dietze, recently took to the unforgiving Dolomite Mountains in Italy and the pair were filmed making their perilous descent, using an incredible amount of skill and physical fitness. The riders are often forced to bail on their one-wheeled machines, which have similar tyres to mountain bikes, as they take a spill during their hair-raising journey. Mr Eichholz has to 'bunny hop' down sheer rock faces, fight to maintain his balance on the treacherous shale beneath him and teeth-grindingly pedal up arduous steep slopes. His exploits have even earned him sponsorship from major sports brands. Eichholz (left) plunges down a slope as his friend Stephanie Dietze looks on . He is also the world record holder for the highest ever unicycle drop, landing a plunge from 6m of an overhanging rock in the Moroccan desert. Extreme mountain unicycling was pioneered during the 1990s on the West Coast of the United States, and has since attracted thousands of enthusiasts from around the world. 'People like the novelty of it,' Wendy Grzych, the president of the Unicycling Society of America,  told the New York Times. 'It’s a whole subculture, and a different makeup than your church friends or work buddies.' The pair won the support of Adidas sportswear, who sponsored their trip and provided a professional cameraman to record their unbelievably dangerous feats . Practitioners claim the sport is no more dangerous than mountain biking, despite the frequency of falls. 'We fall more often than mountain bikers, but we’re going slower so it’s not as bad. 'The same cliffs are out there,' said unicyclist Hans Van Koppen. 'Unicycling is by far much more exercise (than mountain biking),' Van Koppen added. 'You use every part of your body — arms, legs, stomach, back.' The sport has even spawned its own terminology for the many injuries it can cause, such as  'shindentations' (marks where rocks puncture the front of the legs) and 'calf tracks' (thin scars where the pedals cut into the back of the calves). Extreme unicycling is a niche sport but has grown in popularity, despite the dangers .","(554, 29)","German thrill-seeker, Lutz Eichholz, has taken unicycling to new heights by tackling the  most rugged and terrifying peaks on his uni-wheel. This unorthodox way of conquering mountains has earned him the title of an ""extreme unicycling"" enthusiast, and made him one of the world's most remarkable athletes.  Eichholz has been riding unicycles since the tender age of nine and has progressively excelled in the sport, becoming one of the industry's leading figures. He has harnessed his skills to climb some of the most challenging peaks around the world, from Mount Fuji in Japan, to climbing the 3000-meter Marmolada in the Italian Dolomites, an expedition that he considered one of his most challenging ones yet.  To complete the daring feats, Eichholz uses a customized unicycle which is robust enough to withstand the rugged terrain, often with no regard for the lack of balance or the danger that could arise if he stumbled or fell. However, the ""extreme unicycling"" enthusiast credits his intense fitness regime, and strict training schedule for allowing him to successfully complete such daunting climbs safely.   In an interview with BBC, Eichholz shared the backstory behind the conception of his unusual hobby, saying it began as a form of training for balancing sports. Eventually, his love for the sport grew stronger, and he began to push his limits. He explained that despite the dangerous and scary situations that he has found himself in, he finds satisfaction in challenging himself and pushing beyond what he thought was possible.  Notwithstanding the challenges he has overcome, Eichholz says the most difficult part of his climbs is often the beginning when he is attempting to find a starting point. He meticulously reviews maps, making sure he knows the terrain well, to limit the chances of being caught unawares. Nevertheless, he admits to experiencing doubts about whether he will be able to complete the climbs from time to time. Undeterred by these fears, Eichholz consistently sets himself ambitious goals: recently, he completed a climb to the top of a 3200-meter volcano in Chile, and plans to soon attempt to cross the Eastern Alps on his unicycle.  The thrill-seeker is also known to explore the limits of his sport in front of live audiences. He has competed in several extreme unicycling contests across Europe, and holds six world records for various driving disciplines, such as the speed record for the fastest timed distance covered non-stop, and the ascent world record for unicycling on paved roads. Eichholz's passion for mountain unicycling has also spilled over onto social media, where he has a dedicated following of unicycling enthusiasts. They stay social on his Youtube, Facebook and Instagram pages where he shares photos and videos of his climbing expeditions.  To conclude, Lutz Eichholz has made an impressive name for himself, pushing the boundaries of his sport and proving that anything is possible with determination and courage, along with the belief that it's okay to be a little different from the norm.","(551, 18)","By.

(CNN) -- Joey Barton, one of the most controversial footballers in the English Premier League,
","(CNN) -- Joey Barton, one of the most controversial footballers in the English Premier League, has been hit with a 12-match ban by the Football Association (FA). The Queens Park Rangers midfielder, who has 1.5 million followers on micro-blogging site Twitter, was found guilty of two charges of violent conduct during a tumultuous clash with Manchester City earlier this month. Barton was sent off for elbowing Argentina striker Carlos Tevez, then kicked Tevez's compatriot Sergio Aguero before appearing to aim a headbutt at City captain Vincent Kompany. The 29-year-old attended an FA hearing at Wembley on Wednesday where he was given a Â£75,000 ($117,000) fine in addition to his lengthy ban. Manchester City win Premier League as Barton sees red . In a statement on their official website the FA confirmed Barton would receive an initial four match ban for his dismissal and eight more games for his two further offenses. The FA said: ""There are rules of conduct that should be adhered to, and such behavior tarnishes the image of football in this country, particularly as this match was the pinnacle of the domestic season and watched by millions around the globe."" Barton's regular rants on Twitter, interspersed with quotes from philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and lyrics from songs of The Smiths, have gained him a huge following. He often tweets about visits to art galleries and his take on modern culture, and he's also been interviewed on UK political shows such as Newsnight. Barton's indiscretions at Manchester City are the latest in a long line of misdemeanors in what has been a checkered career to date. He was sentenced to six months in prison while a Newcastle United player for an assault in Liverpool city center and later transfer listed by the club after criticizing the hierarchy on Twitter. Prior to that, at Manchester City, he was fined for stubbing a cigar out in the eye of a youth team player and in a separate incident, was sent home from a tour of Thailand after an altercation with a 15-year-old Everton fan. After his red card at City he took to Twitter to try and explain his actions, stating: ""The head was never gone at any stage, once I'd been sent off, one of our players suggested I should try to take 1 of theirs with me."" His 12-match ban puts his future at QPR in doubt, the team having retained their Premier League status on the final day of the season despite his red card. A Rangers spokesman said: ""QPR will be making no comment in regard to the Joey Barton case. An internal investigation will begin in due course.""","(495, 16)","QPR midfielder Joey Barton has been hit with a 12-game ban from the English Football Association (FA), following his actions on the final day of the Premier League season. The 29-year-old was sent off during the match against Manchester City, after he kneed Sergio Aguero and appeared to headbutt Vincent Kompany. Barton's actions, in what was to be QPR's final game of the season, were shocking and completely unnecessary. The midfielder has had a history of disciplinary problems on and off the pitch, which make his latest outburst all the more disappointing. The FA has made it clear that they will not tolerate such behaviour, handing out a strict punishment to ensure that Barton is held accountable for his actions. The 12-game ban means that he will be unable to play for QPR again until November, which is a significant blow to the team's chances next season. QPR manager Harry Redknapp has publicly stated that he is disappointed with the outcome of the FA's investigation. Redknapp had hoped that Barton would be able to play a key role for QPR next season, but that now looks unlikely. Redknapp also made it clear that the team would need to find a suitable replacement for Barton, as they cannot afford to miss out on vital points during his absence. The club will need to bring in a player who can provide the same level of quality and experience that Barton has. The 12-game ban handed out to Barton is among the longest in Premier League history, but it is not the first time that he has been punished for disciplinary issues. In 2012, he was banned for 12 games after being found guilty of two counts of violent conduct during a match against Manchester City. Barton has also faced numerous issues off the pitch, including a six-month prison sentence for assault in 2008. Despite this, he has been able to continue his football career, but it remains to be seen whether he will be able to do so after this latest incident. Many football fans and pundits have criticized Barton's behaviour, labelling him as a thug and calling for him to be banned from football altogether. However, others have defended him, pointing out that he has a fiery personality and is passionate about the game. Whatever the case may be, Barton's 12-game ban is a clear indication that the FA is taking disciplinary issues seriously. It sends a strong message to all players that such behaviour will not be tolerated, and that they will be held accountable for their actions. QPR will now have to move forward without Barton, as they prepare for the upcoming Premier League season. It is a challenging task, but one that they must face if they are to achieve success in the league. Time will tell if they can find a replacement who can fill Barton's shoes and help lead the team to victory.","(539, 21)","(CNN) -- Joey Barton, one of the most controversial footballers in the English Premier League,

Harassed? 90s Playgirl model Daniel Sawka is suing his former employer ADP after he says
","Harassed? 90s Playgirl model Daniel Sawka is suing his former employer ADP after he says he suffered years of ridicule from employees because of his nude photos . A company that helps businesses handle personnel issues denies it forced one if its employees out of his job after it was discovered he had posed nude in Playgirl magazine. Daniel Sawka filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in May 2013 against Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Inc. alleging sexual harassment. The company responded in a court filing Monday. Sawka worked as a regional sales manager for ADP, which offers workforce management services, including payroll services and human resources management, for other companies and says it has more than 610,000 clients around the world. Sawka, who worked for ADP in Windsor and later in Milford, alleges he was subjected to constant jokes and ridicule at work after a woman in his office discovered he had posed nude in the early 1990s in a lumberjack-themed spread for Playgirl and found the photos online. Jokes included 'a comment about homosexual men viewing the photos and what they would be doing while viewing the photos,' according to the lawsuit. '(ADP) employees would say 'timber' or 'lumberjack' in reference to the plaintiff and the plaintiff's photos.' Sawka, 49, said his co-workers continued to download the pictures at work even after he implored them not to and to 'leave me alone.' He said company employees brought the issue up during a dinner in New York honoring Sawka for his job performance and during a company outing to a New York Yankees baseball game. He said he went to the company's personnel department in February 2011 and was promised the company would take appropriate actions. His body was joked about, reports ABC News, including his genitals' and one comment was made about 'what homosexual men viewing the photos would be doing while viewing the photos.' He alleges the company failed to end the ongoing sexual harassment and he was 'constructively discharged,' a legal term meaning the conditions were so intolerable he was forced to leave the job in March 2011. 'The sexual harassment ... that included managers participating in the sexual harassment, condoning it, and failing to stop it caused (Sawka) to be treated unequally when compared to similarly situated sales managers,' the lawsuit says. The company, in its response, denies there was a 'pattern and practice' of jokes, sexually charged comments and ridicule. It also says it 'exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any alleged harassing behavior.' Sawka, who lives in Durham, is seeking damages for lost pay and benefits and emotional distress. A telephone call seeking comment from his attorney on Monday was not immediately returned. Sawka is suing ADP for 'sexual harassment ... that included managers participating in the sexual harassment, condoning it, and failing to stop it' and wants back and front pay, bonuses, personal days, lost pension/retirement benefits, and emotional distress .","(554, 20)","A former employee has opened up about his experience of being sexually harassed at his workplace. Daniel Sawka, 49, claimed that he was subjected to constant ridicule and harassment following the discovery of his nude photos from the early 1990s, which were discovered by a female co-worker at ADP. According to Sawka, his colleagues continued to download and share the images even after he repeatedly pleaded with them to stop and leave him alone. He alleged that the harassment persisted, and the company failed to put a stop to it. Sawka eventually quit his job due to the ongoing trauma. In the 21st century, it is essential to understand that sexual harassment is a significant problem in the workplace. Organizations need to create a safe and conducive work environment for their employees, and take necessary measures to prevent any form of harassment. Employers must take stringent action against employees who indulge in harassing behaviors, regardless of their position in the company. It also crucial for employees to understand their rights and report any such incidents to the management. Sawka's accusations against ADP are a testimony to the critical need for such measures to be put in place. The persistence of harassment in the workplace is a serious concern that needs to be addressed by all employers. In Sawka's case, it appears that ADP failed to take the necessary steps to create a safe working environment for its employees. The lack of prompt action by the organization has resulted in distress for Sawka, which ultimately led to him quitting his job. It is vital for organizations to offer a harassment-free workplace, devoid of unwelcome advances, comments or behavior that creates an intimidating or hostile work environment. Such behavior can undermine employee dignity and productivity. Regardless of an employee's gender or position, every employee has the right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Employers need to proactively educate and create awareness among their employees, and set up a system through which employees can report incidents of harassment. The consequences of harassment in the workplace can be dire, not just for the employee, but also for the company, both legally and financially. It is therefore up to employers to take necessary actions and create a safe, respectful, and inclusive work environment. In conclusion, the case of Sawka raises significant concerns with regards to the measures taken or not taken by employers to create a safe and respectful work environment. Employers must put in place effective measures to prevent and curb sexual harassment in the workplace. Employees need to be made aware of their rights and encouraged to come forward in case of incidents that violate these rights. This will aid in fostering a safe and inclusive work environment and a more productive workplace.","(509, 23)","Harassed? 90s Playgirl model Daniel Sawka is suing his former employer ADP after he says

'leave me alone'. He alleges that the company failed to put an end to the ongoing sexual
harassment, which forced him to quit his job.
Sawka filed a lawsuit against ADP in New York State Supreme Court last week, claiming
that the company did not do enough to protect him from sexual harassment. He also
alleges that ADP violated the New York City Human Rights Law and the New York State
Human Rights Law. According to the lawsuit, Sawka began working for ADP in 2013 as a
sales representative. In 2014, a woman at the company discovered that Sawka had posed
nude for Playgirl magazine when he was in his early 20s. The woman then showed the
photos to her co-workers, who began to make fun of Sawka and download the photos at
work. Sawka asked the woman to stop showing the photos to her co-workers and to stop
downloading the photos at work. However, the woman continued to show the photos to
her co-workers and download them at work. Sawka also reported the harassment to his
supervisor, but the supervisor did not take any action to stop the harassment. As a result,
Sawka was forced to quit his job at ADP.
In his lawsuit, Sawka is seeking damages for emotional distress, lost wages, and other
damages. He is also seeking an injunction to prevent ADP from continuing to engage in
sexual harassment. ADP has not yet commented on the lawsuit. This case highlights the
importance of protecting employees from sexual harassment in the workplace. Employers
have a responsibility to create a safe and respectful work environment for all employees.

in the workplace, you can file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. The EEOC will

","Hull manager Steve Bruce has defended under-fire Wigan chairman Dave Whelan, insisting he is not a racist. Whelan has been accused of making anti-Semitic comments as well as claiming there was 'nothing bad' in calling a Chinese person a 'chink' during an interview with the Guardian. That comes on the back of his controversial appointment of Malky Mackay as Latics manager at a time when the former Cardiff boss is under investigation by the Football Association for allegedly exchanging discriminatory texts with then colleague Iain Moody. Malky Mackay was appointed Wigan boss this week, despite the text and email scandal . Whelan has come under fire and has faced accusations of being racist in some quarters . Whelan, 77, has since apologised for causing offence and Bruce, who managed Wigan on two occasions under Whelan's watch, is willing to stand as a character witness. 'Maybe sitting on the fence might be the easiest thing to do but I've worked under Dave Whelan twice - I know him very, very well,' said Bruce. 'There's no racism in him at all. Sometimes words can be said which can be misplaced, they can be out there in the public domain, but certainly when I've worked with him there's been no sign of racism. But Hull boss Steve Bruce has defended Whelan and insisted that he is not a racist . 'He is without question one of the best chairmen I've worked for. What you see is what you get.' Bruce also described appointing Mackay as Uwe Rosler's replacement prior to the FA verdict as a 'brave' call. 'It's a big brave decision by him,' added Bruce. 'But he thinks that's the best thing for his football club. Being Dave he'll be single-minded enough to see that through.'","(335, 16)","Hull City boss Steve Bruce has come to the defense of Wigan Athletic chairman Dave Whelan, amid the ongoing controversy surrounding his decision to appoint Malky Mackay as Latics manager. Whelan drew criticism after it emerged that Mackay had exchanged allegedly racist, sexist, and homophobic texts with his former colleague, Iain Moody. However, in an interview with BBC Radio 5 live, Bruce claimed that Whelan is not a racist himself and that he has been unfairly targeted by the media. ""I worked for Dave Whelan for two and a half years and he's not a racist, I can assure you of that,"" Bruce stated. ""He's made an unfortunate comment which people have jumped all over. But having worked for him, I can say he's not a racist. He's done so much for Wigan over the years and now this has overshadowed everything."" The comment Bruce was referring to took place during an interview Whelan gave to The Guardian, in which he defended Mackay's controversial references to Jews and Chinese people. ""I think Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else,"" said Mackay in a text message to Moody, while in another message he referred to the Cardiff City owner, Vincent Tan, as a ""chink."" In response to the controversy, Whelan claimed that Mackay's comments were merely a case of ""banter"" and not intended to be racist. Whelan has since apologized for any offense caused by his comments, but continues to stand by Mackay's appointment. ""Malky has made mistakes, he knows that,"" Whelan said. ""But he's a good man and a good football manager. He deserves another chance and that's what we're giving him.""

","By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 06:58 EST, 22 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:59 EST, 22 November 2013 . Marijuana use in one of London's most notorious jails was so rife that visiting officials carrying out an inspection noticed their clothes smelt of it, a shocking new report has revealed. Inmates of A and B wings in Brixton prison in south London are said to have smoked so much cannabis that its distinctive smell tainted the clothes of guards and visitors from the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB). The IMB report said the easy availability of illegal drugs in the Category C prison, which only had one sniffer dog, was a 'major concern' and was to blame for 'gambling, indebtedness, bullying and intimidation' amongst inmates. Cannabis use is so widespread at Brixton Prison, pictured, that visitors' clothes smelt of it, a new report says . Referring to concerns over bullying at the jail, it said: 'The fuel for much of the bullying was the availability of illegal drugs – much more noticeable than when Brixton was a local prison. 'Cannabis was sometimes being smoked so much on A and B wings that officers’ and IMB members’ clothes smelt of it.' The report said the drugs were largely being brought into the prison by men who had gone out on temporary licence - on day or overnight release - and said there had been a 'significant failure' by prison authorities to address this problem. It went on: 'A major concern for the Board this year has been the availability of illicit drugs, mobilephones, and other items of contraband. 'This has led to gambling, indebtedness, bullying and intimidation, resulting, in some areas, in a significant deterioration of the generally harmonious regime in the prison.' Other concerns were the availability of the synthetic marijuana drug known as Spice, and prisoners using home-made hooch. The independent report said cannabis was being brought into the jail by inmates who'd been on day release . The independent report concluded that a staff shortage at the prison was to blame. It said: 'Brixton is having to shoulder the burden of a significant headcount reduction. The prison’s staff complement fell about four per cent in the year covered by this report. 'By January 2014 there will be a 17% reduction compared with September 2012. This is bound to weaken further the regime’s effectiveness'. The report said there should be more searches of both prisoners and visitors, and said a second sniffer dog should be brought in to help.","(482, 24)","A new report has revealed the troubling prevalence of drugs at a Category C jail in the UK. Independent Monitoring Board visitors noted the smell of drugs on prisoners’ clothes in the A and B wings of the facility, prompting further investigation. The report goes on to highlight the various negative consequences of drug use within the prison walls. Cannabis in particular has been blamed for fueling incidents of bullying, gambling, debt, and intimidation amongst inmates. The drug is thought to have been brought in by men returning from day release. This alarming trend underscores the security challenges posed by prison drug use. Despite efforts to combat drug smuggling, prisoners continue to find ways to acquire and consume illegal substances. The shortage of staff at the Category C jail is cited as one factor contributing to the problem. The report suggests that more needs to be done to address the root causes of drug use, such as mental health issues and social exclusion. Additionally, it recommends increasing staffing levels to better monitor visitors and keep a closer eye on prisoners. While the report paints a grim picture of the state of affairs at the Category C jail, it also highlights some promising developments. For example, the prison has implemented a harm reduction program that provides inmates with clean needles and education on safe injection practices. These efforts are seen as an important step towards reducing the negative impacts of drug use within the facility. However, much work remains to be done to ensure the safety and well-being of prisoners and staff alike. The report’s findings serve as a call to action for prison authorities, policymakers, and the broader public to address the systemic issues that contribute to drug use in prisons. It is hoped that the report will spur greater investment in mental health services, education and training for staff, and more effective monitoring of visitors and prisoners. Only through a coordinated and collaborative effort can the scourge of prison drug use be successfully tackled.","(369, 17)","By. Harriet Arkell. PUBLISHED:. 06:58 EST, 22 November 2013. |.

Report on Category C jail says shortage of staff is partly to blame
Prisoners at a Category C jail have easy access to drugs because of a shortage of staff, a report has found.
Visitors from the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) noticed a strong smell of cannabis on the clothes of inmates at HMP Elmley, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.
The report, published on Thursday, said the drugs were thought to be brought into the prison by men who had returned from day release.
It also blamed the drugs for bullying, gambling and debt, as well as intimidation of inmates.
The report said: ‘There is no doubt that drugs are easily available in both A and B wings.
‘Visitors from the IMB have noticed a strong odour of cannabis on the clothing of prisoners on their return from visits.’
The report added: ‘It is widely believed that drugs are being brought into the establishment by prisoners returning from day release.’
The report also said there was a shortage of staff at the prison, which is run by private firm Sodexo Justice Services.
It said: ‘The shortage of staff is having an impact on the ability of the prison to operate effectively.

(CNN) -- A police officer jailed on a first-degree murder charge in a two-state shooting
","(CNN) -- A police officer jailed on a first-degree murder charge in a two-state shooting rampage was on his computer at the time of shootings and could not have committed them, prosecutors said Tuesday evening. Brian E. Dorian, 37, was to be released on his own recognizance Tuesday night, and charges against him will be formally dismissed Wednesday, Will County State's Attorney James W. Glasgow announced. ""I feel horrible that Brian Dorian went through this,"" said Glasgow, adding that evidence at the time and identification in lineups merited the charges. ""At no time did we stop looking for exculpatory evidence."" A forensic analysis of Dorian's home computer and its activity put Dorian at home at the time of the shootings, authorities said. The officer also told them he was watching sports programs and using e-mail. John Dorian, the officer's father, told CNN affiliate WLS he was ""relieved"" and ""never doubted his son."" Police now are looking at other leads in the shootings. Earlier in the day, Dorian appeared in court via a hookup from the Will County Jail. He did not speak but his attorney entered a not guilty plea, WLS reported. Several friends and relatives wore T-shirts bearing the message ""Free Brian."" ""There's an innocent man sitting behind bars and somebody else is running around out there knowing that he got away with it. It's not fair,"" Jill Aggen, a friend of Dorian, told WLS. ""No doubt in my mind. He's not capable of it."" Dorian, an officer with the Lynwood Police Department, was arrested Friday in the killing of one person and the wounding of three others in the spree, which occurred south of Chicago, Illinois. He was held on a probable cause warrant, and bail was set at $2.5 million. Dorian, who according to WLS has been on medical leave for an injured shoulder the past year, was taken into custody Friday at his residence, said authorities. The shootings began about 10:30 a.m. October 5 at a construction site near Beecher, Illinois. The gunman killed one worker at the site and wounded two others, police have said. An hour later and about 10 miles away in Lowell, Indiana, authorities believe the same gunman opened fire again -- this time on a local farmer. Keith Dahl was shot in the left shoulder, arm and elbow, and then was robbed. Dahl told Lake County (Indiana) Sheriff's Detective Robert Martinez that the gunman approached him on his farm and started a conversation about bees before beginning to shoot. The gunman was believed to be using a revolver -- possibly a Colt .38-caliber or .357 Magnum -- because no shell casings were found at either scene, Lake County Sheriff Rogelio ""Roy"" Dominguez said.","(534, 24)","A police officer who had been detained in connection with shootings in Illinois and Indiana is set to be released after a computer analysis showed that he was at home at the time of the crimes. Brian E. Dorian, a 37-year-old former police officer, had been held on a $2.5 million bail after being implicated in the shootings, which took place in the vicinity of Chicago. One person was killed and three others were injured in the shootings. Dorian, who had been employed as a police officer before being fired following the shootings, had maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal. He had argued that he was not present at the scene of the crime when the shootings occurred. After a thorough computer analysis, it was determined that Dorian was, in fact, at home at the time of the shootings. This information was instrumental in securing his release from custody. Dorian's lawyer, Jeffrey Tomczak, was pleased with the decision. ""We're grateful to the computer analysis that showed conclusively that Brian Dorian was at home when the crimes were committed,"" Tomczak said. The shootings took place over a period of several days in the south of Chicago, in areas such as Crete and Beecher. The attacks had initially been blamed on a police impersonator, which led to widespread fear and concern among the residents of the area. The shootings left one man dead and three others injured, including a farmer who was shot while working in his field. The shootings had caused a great deal of anxiety in the community until Dorian's arrest. While Dorian had been detained, he had maintained his innocence and had pleaded with authorities to investigate further in order to clear his name. His family had also been vocal in their support, insisting that Dorian had nothing to do with the shootings. Dorian's release comes as a relief to both him and his family, as well as to the community at large. The true perpetrator of the shootings has yet to be identified, but authorities continue to investigate the matter. In conclusion, the release of Brian E. Dorian after computer analysis showed he was at home during the time of the shootings south of Chicago, is a positive development for all parties involved. While the true perpetrator remains at large, Dorian can now return to his life outside of custody thanks to the advanced technology used in the investigation.","(448, 19)","(CNN) -- A police officer jailed on a first-degree murder charge in a two-state shooting

Brian E. Dorian, 32, was being held on a $2.5-million bail in the slaying of a man in
Indiana and the wounding of three people in Illinois.
Dorian, a 10-year veteran of the Calumet City, Illinois, police force, was charged with
first-degree murder and attempted murder in connection with the shootings that took place
within minutes of each other in Hammond, Indiana, and South Holland, Illinois, last month.
He was also charged with unlawful use of a weapon by a felon.
Hammond Police Chief John Doughty said Dorian's computer showed he was logged on to the

Dorian's attorney, Thomas Durkin, told CNN affiliate WLS-TV in Chicago that his client had
been set up by a disgruntled ex-girlfriend who wanted him out of the way so she could be
with her new boyfriend, a Hammond police officer.
Durkin said Dorian had no motive to commit the crimes because he had just been promoted to
the rank of sergeant and was making more money than ever before.
Dorian has been suspended from the police force without pay since his arrest. He is
scheduled to appear in court for a preliminary hearing on January 22.

By . Damien Gayle . A 90-year-old woman was locked away and left to starve
","By . Damien Gayle . A 90-year-old woman was locked away and left to starve to death by her own children, police say. Xiaoming Tsui survived a month of captivity in her bedroom by drinking water and eating a few porridge oats neighbours were able to throw in while her children were out. When police burst in at the end of last week to free her after a tip off posted online, her first words were: 'Please, feed me, feed me.' Horrific: Ninety-year-old Xiaoming Tsui is helped to wash after nearly a month in captivity with no food after her children allegedly hatched a plan to starve her to death because they were tired of caring for her . Her daughter and son are now facing charges of attempted murder after police accused them of 'a cold and calculating plan to get rid of someone they found expensive and tiresome to deal with'. A police spokesman said: 'The woman fell ill and to get rid of the problem of having to care for her, her children attempted to make her die from starvation in the locked room. 'They didn't send their mother any food, telling her it was so she didn't need the bathroom, and would allow no-one in to see her.' Neighbours in Yangjuan village in Hunan, China, who realised Mrs Xiaoming was not being given much to eat were able on several occasions to pass oatmeal up to her through an open window. Although they did not know that she was being given nothing, it is believed that one of them was the person who posted the anonymous online message which alerted police to her plight. Emaciated: Her daughter and son are now facing charges of attempted murder after police accused them of 'a cold and calculating plan to get rid of someone they found expensive and tiresome to deal with' 'There had been friction between the old lady and her children for some time,' said the police spokesman. 'She was becoming an increasing burden to them and so they decided to kill her by starving her to death. 'Then they planned to tell the authorities that she simply stopped eating.' The spokesman added: 'This is not just a family dispute, but calculated murder. Obviously, the selfish children wanted their mother to die to save them trouble of taking care of her.'","(436, 16)","In a heart-stopping incident, Xiaoming Tsui, a resident of a quiet suburban neighbourhood, narrowly escaped death after being thrown food by concerned neighbours. The 67-year-old woman was trapped in her apartment after her son and daughter allegedly attempted to murder her. The incident occurred on Monday night, when neighbours first noticed unusual sounds coming from Ms. Tsui’s apartment. They heard her cries for help coming from the window, and on investigating found that the door was locked from the inside. Fearing the worst, they immediately sought to help her. With no way to enter the apartment, the neighbours started throwing food to the window from the street below. They hoped to provide Ms. Tsui with sustenance as she waited for help, and to keep her alive until rescue services arrived.  Ms. Tsui depended on the kindness of neighbours who threw food up to the window in order to survive. Their efforts did not go in vain. An anonymous person eventually posted a tip-off online, and rescue services rushed to the scene. They were able to break the door down and rescue Ms. Tsui, who was weak and severely dehydrated after being trapped for several hours. The police immediately launched an investigation, and after interrogating Ms. Tsui’s son and daughter, they have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The details of the attempt are not clear, and it is not known whether this was a premeditated attack. The identity of the anonymous person who tipped off the rescue services is also unknown. The neighbourhood has been shaken by the incident, and many are praising the actions of the concerned neighbours who saved Ms. Tsui’s life. Social media has been buzzing with messages of support for Ms. Tsui and condemnation for the alleged attackers. Ms. Tsui was taken to a nearby hospital, where she is currently receiving medical attention. Her condition remains stable but the long term effects of her ordeal are yet to be determined. The incident highlights the importance of community and vigilance in keeping one another safe.  It is fortunate that the quick thinking actions of those in the community saved Ms. Tsui from a potentially horrific fate. The police have pledged to uncover the details of this crime and to bring justice to the victim. The incident also serves as a reminder of the importance of both iegal and moral obligations to seek help when a danger is sensed.","(445, 22)","By. Damien Gayle. A 90-year-old woman was locked away and left to starve
to death by her son and daughter, police in Hong Kong have said.
Xiaoming Tsui, who lived alone in a flat in the city’s Sham Shui Po district,
survived thanks to neighbours throwing food to her window.
She was only saved after a tip-off from an anonymous person posted online.
Her son and daughter, aged 50 and 48, were arrested on suspicion of
attempted murder, police said.
Tsui was found emaciated and malnourished when she was taken to hospital
last week. She weighed less than 30kg (66lb) and was unable to walk or
speak, according to the South China Morning Post.
Police said they had received a tip-off from a member of the public who
had seen a photo of Tsui on social media and recognised her as a neighbour
who had not been seen for some time.
When officers went to her flat, they found it in a state of disarray and
smelled a foul odour coming from inside.
They broke down the door and found Tsui lying on the floor in a pool of
urine and faeces. She was rushed to hospital where she remains in a
critical but stable condition.
A police spokesman told the SCMP that Tsui’s son and daughter had been
arrested on suspicion of “causing grievous bodily harm with intent”. They
were released on bail and are due to appear in court later this month.
Neighbours told the newspaper that Tsui had been living alone since her
husband died in 2015. They described her as a reclusive woman who kept to
herself and rarely spoke to anyone.
One neighbour, who gave his name as Mr Chan, said he had tried to visit
Tsui several times over the past few months but had been unable to gain
access to her flat.
“I knocked on the door but there was no answer,” he said. “I called out to
her but there was no response.”
Another neighbour, who gave her name as Ms Wong, said she had also tried
to visit Tsui several times but had not been able to gain access to her
flat. She said she had been concerned about Tsui’s welfare and had
reported her disappearance to the police.
“She was a very nice lady,” Ms Wong said. “I am very sad to hear what has
happened to her. I hope she will recover soon.”
The case has sparked outrage in Hong Kong, with many people expressing
shock and anger at the apparent neglect of an elderly woman by her own
son and daughter.
“Why did they do this to their own mother?” one person wrote on social
media. “They should be ashamed of themselves.”
Another person wrote: “This is so heartbreaking. I can’t believe this
happened in our city.”","(538, 26)","By . Damien Gayle . A 90-year-old woman was locked away and left to starve
A 90-YEAR-OLD woman was left to starve to death in her own home after her son and daughter locked her in and refused to feed her, a court has heard.
Xiaoming Tsui, 90, was only saved when a neighbour threw food through her window and alerted the police.
Her son and daughter, who are both in their 60s, have been charged with attempted murder after she was found emaciated and covered in her own faeces and urine.
The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have been remanded in custody and are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Monday.
Ms Tsui’s ordeal began in 2016 when her son, who lives with her, and his wife, who also lives in the house, began to refuse to feed her.
The court heard that Ms Tsui, who was born in China and moved to the UK in the 1960s, had been left with no food or water for up to 10 days at a time.
She was only able to leave her room to go to the toilet and was not allowed to leave the house, the court heard.
Her daughter-in-law, who is also in her 60s and lives in the same house, told the court that she had tried to help Ms Tsui but was unable to do so.
She told the court: “I tried to help her but I couldn’t. I tried to feed her but she didn’t want to eat.
“I couldn’t do anything for her.”
The court also heard that the couple’s daughter, who is in her 40s and lives with them, had also refused to feed Ms Tsui.
The daughter told the court she had been unable to help her mother because she was “too weak”.
She said: “She was too weak to get out of bed. She couldn’t get out of her bed.
“She couldn’t even get out of the bed. She was too weak.”
The couple’s son told the court he had been trying to help his mother but had not been able to.
He said he had tried to get her to eat but she had refused.
He also told the court his mother had been refusing to eat for a long time.
He added: “It’s been a long time since she’s been able to eat. She’s been refusing food for a long, long time.”
The daughter-in law told the court her daughter had been “very, very weak” and had been unable “to do anything” for her mother.
She also told the judge that her daughter had “been very, very ill” and had “had a lot of problems”.
The judge said Ms Tsui was “very frail” and “very weak” and that she had “not been able to do anything for herself”.
He said the couple had “done everything they could” to help her and that they had “tried to help her”.
He added that he had “no doubt” that the couple had been trying “to help” Ms Tsui and that “they had done everything in their power to help”.
He concluded: “They have done everything they could to help her.
They have tried to do everything they can to help her, but they have not been able.”

By . Tara Brady . A death metal band is living up to the type
","By . Tara Brady . A death metal band is living up to the type of music it creates by risking suffocation and playing in an airtight, soundproof steel box. The band, called Unfathomable Ruination, has been performing on the streets of London as part of a project called Box Sized DIE and they play until the oxygen runs out. The idea was the creation of Portuguese artist Joao Onofre which formed part of an exhibition called Sculpture in the City. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Art? The band called Unfathomable Ruination perform with the doors of the steel box open . Security guards close the door and lock members of the death metal band inside the box . This performance art involves one sound-proof steel cube and a metal band that plays inside until oxygen runs out . The band will be performing three times a week until August 1 in London's financial district and much like the offices around it, passers-by cannot hear or see what is going on inside. According to the musicians, conditions inside the cube are extremely hot, but they feel it is worth it all in the name of art. Daniel Herrera, Unfathomable Ruination’s guitarist, said: ‘These are extreme conditions and we play extreme music so this our connection.’ The band play first with the doors open and then with the doors closed. One band member wipes away sweat from his face after playing in the airtight steel box . The band told CNN that although conditions inside the cube are extremely hot they felt it was worth it . The band play first with the doors open and then with the doors closed until the oxygen runs out in the box . The idea was the creation of artist Joao Onofre (pictured) standing in front of the band . According to the artist behind the piece, the box is a symbol of the 'boxy' offices in the area where people work. Onofre said: 'In this corporate architecture you do not see what is going on inside. The same thing is happening here.' So how long can a death metal band play in an airtight, soundproof box - the band lasted 14 minutes the first time they played and have so far reached the 19 minute mark.","(416, 21)","Heavy metal band Unfathomable Ruination has taken to the streets of London to perform as part of an exhibition called Sculpture in the City.

The band has been performing daily since the start of the exhibition, and their performances have been drawing large crowds.

","Freda Murphy probably didn't think she needed to rely on a holy intervention to get the floor of her Birmingham home fixed. But that's exactly what she got. When the mother-of-five took a picture of her Erdington bathroom for insurers, she was stunned to discover the outline of a face she believes to be Jesus, with a tear falling from the right eye, present. But the spooky imprint is far from the first unexplained happening to occur at her 100-year-old home. Scroll down for video . Freda Murphy claims an image of Jesus appeared in a photograph she took at her Birmingham home . Mr Murphy says she can make out eyes, a nose, mouth, long hair and a beard in the imprint which appears in the photograph she took of her bathroom floor . Ms Murphy has been so rattled by things that go bump in the night, she’s called in a spiritualist. During her 19 years at the house, the 52-year-old and her family have encountered ghosts, heard babies cry in the night, and have even been prodded in their sleep. A baby is believed to have died at the property during the war. Ms Murphy said, on one occasion 'a mist, like a cloud, appeared above my head while I was hoovering. So much has gone on here. A lot of people have been frightened.' But she said the image of Christ is the strangest of the strange encounters the family have experienced. Ms Murphy explained: 'We’d just had the floor laid down and I was taking a picture for my solicitor. Ms Murphy says her family have encountered ghosts, heard babies crying and even been prodded in their sleep, in their haunted home . 'The floor was totally clear. When I looked at the image, it sent a shiver down my spine. I could makeout eyes, a nose, mouth, long hair and beard. A lot of people have said it looks like Jesus.' In another scene straight from a horror movie, Ms Murphy's sick soon claimed to have had a very personal encounter with the unknown. Ms Murphy said: 'As he lay in bed, massive beams of light bounced off the walls. He said he also felt something touching him.' She said the spiritualist had confirmed the family's suspicions about their house being haunted, saying, 'there was an awful lot of activity going on in the house'. Ms Murphy added: 'No one can explain it. And no one can tell us what it means.' Despite the scary happenings, Ms Murphy said she was 'not scared any more' and her family, including her children who are aged between 14 and 30, aren't going to move.","(516, 27)","A family in Birmingham, UK, has been left terrified after a spooky image appeared in a photograph taken for insurers. The picture, which was taken during a routine inspection of the property, seems to show a ghostly figure lurking in the background. According to the family, this is not the first time they have encountered ghosts in their home. They reportedly called in a spiritualist who confirmed that there was ""an awful lot of activity going on"" at the property. The family, who have asked not to be named, say they have experienced a range of spooky incidents since moving into the house seven years ago. These include doors slamming shut on their own, objects moving by themselves, and strange noises such as footsteps and whispers. The photograph was taken by an inspector from the family's insurance company, following a claim for water damage. The family say they did not notice the spooky figure in the background until they were reviewing the images later. ""It was really creepy,"" one family member told reporters. ""We showed it to our friends and they all noticed the figure straight away. It's definitely not something we expected to see."" The family's experiences have attracted the attention of paranormal investigators and ghost hunters, who are keen to explore the property for themselves. However, the family say they are not keen on the idea and just want to be left alone. ""We're all terrified,"" another family member said. ""We don't know what's going on in this house, but we know it's not good. We just want to find a way to get rid of whatever it is."" The spiritualist who visited the property said that there was ""a lot of negative energy"" present and that the family needed to take steps to protect themselves. This could involve cleansing rituals, such as smudging with sage or using protective crystals, as well as keeping the home clear of clutter and negative emotions. The family say they are willing to try anything to rid their home of the spooky goings-on. They have even considered moving out, but are worried that the problem may follow them to their new home. This is not the first time that Birmingham has been in the news for spooky goings-on. The city is home to a number of reportedly haunted locations, including the famous ""black monk"" of HMP Birmingham and the spooky corridors of Aston Hall. For now, the family are still living in their haunted home, trying to cope with the spooky incidents that seem to be a regular occurrence. Whether they will be able to rid themselves of their unwanted housemates remains to be seen.","(509, 24)","Freda Murphy probably didn't think she needed to rely on a holy intervention to get
her insurance claim approved. However, that's exactly what she had to do after a
ghostly apparition appeared in one of her family's photographs.
Murphy and her family have been living in their Birmingham home for over a decade,
but it wasn't until recently that they started experiencing paranormal activity.
One day, while taking a photo of her daughter, Murphy noticed a strange figure in
the background. At first, she thought it was just a trick of the light, but when
she looked at the photo more closely, she realized that it was actually a ghostly
figure standing behind her daughter.
Murphy immediately contacted a local spiritualist, who confirmed that there was
indeed an ""awful lot of activity"" going on at the property. The spiritualist
advised Murphy to perform a cleansing ritual to rid the house of any negative
energies, which she did. However, the ghostly figure continued to appear in
Murphy's photos, leading her to believe that the spirit was trying to communicate
with her.
Murphy decided to take matters into her own hands and try to contact the spirit
herself. She set up a Ouija board in her living room and asked the spirit to
identify itself. To her surprise, the spirit revealed that it was the ghost of a
woman who had lived in the house many years ago. The woman told Murphy that she
had died in a tragic accident and that she was now trapped in the house, unable
to move on to the afterlife.
Murphy was shocked by the revelation, but she was determined to help the spirit
find peace. She contacted a local priest, who agreed to perform an exorcism at
the house. The exorcism was successful, and the ghostly figure no longer appeared
in Murphy's photos.
However, Murphy's troubles were far from over. Shortly after the exorcism, she
received a letter from her insurance company informing her that her claim had
been denied. The insurance company claimed that the ghostly apparition was not a
valid reason for denying the claim.
Murphy was outraged by the decision and decided to take legal action against the
insurance company. She hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit, arguing that the
insurance company had discriminated against her based on her religious beliefs.
The case went to trial, and after much debate, the judge ruled in Murphy's favor.
The insurance company was ordered to pay Murphy the full amount of her claim, plus
interest and legal fees.
Murphy was thrilled with the outcome of the case, but she was also grateful that
she had been able to help the ghostly spirit find peace. She hopes that her story
will inspire others to stand up for their rights and to never give up, no matter
how difficult the situation may seem.","(535, 24)","Freda Murphy probably didn't think she needed to rely on a holy intervention to get

(CNN) -- China's Olympic adventure may be over, but new age chanteuse Sa Dingding is
","(CNN) -- China's Olympic adventure may be over, but new age chanteuse Sa Dingding is one global export that in many ways echoes the Beijing Olympic fantasy of ""One World. One Dream."" Sa Dingding's music should find a home on the iPods of millions of chill-out world music fans. Born to a Mongolian mother and Han Chinese father, she sings in Mandarin, Tibetan, Sanskrit, and the rare dialect of Lagu, while fusing chill-out beats and floaty instrumentation played on zither, horse head fiddle and bamboo flute. Already hugely popular in China, she has been finding similar success farther afield: Her first album sold 2 million copies in Southeast Asia, and she has appeared on MTV. Earlier this year she won a BBC Radio 3 World Music Award as well as performing at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Her linguistic skills and musicianship were honed from a young age. Born in Inner Mongolia in 1983, she spent three years until the age of 6 with her grandmother, living a nomadic life in northern China, where her imagination and creativity were allowed to roam free. ""We actually lived in a small city between grassland and the big city. In spring time, we move to the grassland. And in winter time, we moved back to the city,""she told CNN's Talk Asia. ""The whole memory of my childhood is in one word: Play. I just played everywhere on the grassland. And there a lot of interesting things happened which affected the ... life of mine."" Later she became a student of Buddhism and yoga as well as becoming a multi-instrumentalist, releasing her first album at the age of 18. Melding different musical cultures and ethnic influences, notably Tibetan, has also caused a certain amount of discussion, especially on her own position toward the status of Tibet within China. ""From a musician's point of view, Tibetan culture and its music cannot be seen as an isolated subject... lots and lots of other ethnicities have added their colors on the Tibetan culture. So I see the Tibetan culture nowadays as an integral part of the greater Chinese culture,"" she said. Aiming to avoid controversy, organizers of the Glastonbury festival dropped her from this year's lineup. ""I don't quite understand the reason behind [it]. To me, art and music really belong to the whole world and they shouldn't be limited by boundaries. So I really hope that I could join Glastonbury next year,"" she said. Until then further explorations in language and music beckon, and there have been recent collaborations with house music DJ Paul Oakenfold and French chill-out duo Deep Forest in Europe. ""It's very amazing because when I had to return to China, they drove me to the airport and told me: 'Life is full of miracles. When you first arrived here, these three songs didn't exist. But now you're leaving, and we have three wonderful new songs.'""","(571, 26)","A rising star in the music industry, a half-Mongolian, half-Chinese musician known for his unique blend of ethnic influences and chill-out beats has set the stage on fire. His debut album sold over 2 million copies in South East Asia and cemented his position as a talented musician with a flair for combining different styles of music. However, the musician's path to success has not been without controversy. He recently made headlines after being dropped from the lineup of the prestigious Glastonbury Festival, one of the biggest music festivals in the world, where he was slated to perform in front of a massive crowd. The decision to drop him was made due to concerns over the controversial nature of his music, which blends cultural elements from his Mongolian and Chinese heritage with electronic beats and modern instrumentation. Despite being disappointed with the decision, the musician has taken it in his stride, showing resilience and determination to continue pursuing his passion for music. In a recent interview, he stated that he was not surprised by the controversy surrounding his music, as he believes that his unique blend of ethnic and modern styles challenges people's preconceived notions about what music should sound like. Many of his fans have come out in support of him, calling the decision to drop him from the line-up ""disappointing"" and ""short-sighted."" They see his music as a celebration of diversity and an expression of his cultural heritage, and believe that he deserves a platform to share his talent with the rest of the world. The musician's success in South East Asia has not gone unnoticed, and many music critics have praised his ability to bridge cultural divides and create music that appeals to a diverse range of audiences. His debut album was a resounding success, featuring a range of songs that showcased his talent for blending traditional Mongolian and Chinese folk music with modern beats and electronic sounds. Despite the setback at Glastonbury, the musician is not deterred, and is currently working on a follow-up album that promises to be even more impressive than his debut. He has stated that he is keen to keep exploring the possibilities of fusing different styles of music together, and hopes to continue challenging people's ideas about what music should sound like. Overall, the half-Mongolian, half-Chinese musician is a rising star in the music industry, known for his unique blend of ethnic and modern styles. His debut album was a massive success, and despite facing controversy and setbacks, he remains determined to continue pursuing his passion for music and sharing his talent with the world.","(479, 15)","(CNN) -- China's Olympic adventure may be over, but new age chanteuse Sa Dingding is

British Airways is suspending all of its flights between London and two West African nations
","British Airways is suspending all of its flights between London and two West African nations for the rest of the year as the region struggles to contain the worst ever outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus. The airline initially said it was halting its service between Heathrow Airport and Liberia and Sierra Leone until the end of August due to ‘the deteriorating public health situation in both countries’, but it confirmed that it is extending the suspension until 31 December. The decision was announced by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office in an updated travel advisory for Britons. Grounded: British Airways has extended its flight ban for two countries dealing with an Ebola outbreak . In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, British Airways said: ‘The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will regularly reassess the routes in the coming months. ‘Customers with tickets on those routes are being offered a full refund or a range of rebooking options.’ British Airways, the national flag carrier for the UK, normally operates four flights a week between Heathrow Airport and Monrovia, Liberia, with a stopover in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Air France has suspended its flights to and from Sierra Leone, and the French government has urged French nationals to leave Sierra Leone amid concerns about the epidemic that has killed more than 1,400 people in four countries. Several airlines have stopped flying into and out of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria as they grapple with the worst outbreak since the virus was first detected in 1976. British Airways followed the lead of Emirates, which became the first major international airline to cancel flights, and African carriers Arik and ASKY. Epidemic: More than 1,400 have died during the worst Ebola outbreak since the virus was first detected . Kenya Airways and Korean Air Lines have also halted flights to the region. The current outbreak is believed to have started in Guinea last December. The World Health Organisation said the risk of transmission of Ebola virus disease during air travel is low and it does not recommend any ban on international travel or trade. The FCO is encouraging people to refer to the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s website before travelling to the affected countries, but it has not implemented any travel restrictions. The FCO issued a warning on its website: ‘You should carefully assess your need to travel to these countries. If you do decide to travel, you should make sure you have adequate arrangements in place for onward travel/exit and have adequate emergency health provision.’ Ebola is spread by close contact with organs or bodily fluids from an infected person or animal – living or dead – and there is no proven cure or vaccine. The highly transmissible virus causes haemorrhagic fever that kills as many as 60 per cent to 80 per cent of the people it infects in Africa.","(532, 17)","British Airways has announced that it has cancelled all its flights until the end of the year, citing the current global health crisis as the main reason behind the decision. According to reports, the airline will not be resuming its operations until December 31. This move comes as several countries continue to report a significant surge in COVID-19 cases. While the airline industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, carriers across the globe have been attempting to find alternative ways to operate safely. However, the decision to discontinue all flights has been seen as a necessary measure as countries continue to report rising numbers of coronavirus cases. In addition to British Airways' decision, the French government has also urged its citizens to leave Sierra Leone, a country that has been hit hard by the pandemic. Reports indicate that the West African nation has recorded over 1,500 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with several fatalities. In a statement released recently, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged its citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to Sierra Leone and advised those who are currently in the country to leave as soon as possible. The statement further noted that the French Embassy in Sierra Leone would provide assistance to its nationals who wish to return home. The World Health Organisation (WHO), however, has declined to recommend any ban on travel or trade despite the increasing number of cases being reported globally. The move by the WHO is in line with its previous guidance on travel restrictions and bans, which it has consistently said were not necessary in the fight against the pandemic. According to the WHO, the most effective way to combat the spread of the virus is through measures such as social distancing, hand hygiene, and wearing face masks. The organisation has called on governments across the world to focus on implementing these measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. The global health crisis has had a significant impact on the airline industry, with several airlines reporting significant losses in revenue due to the pandemic. The decision by British Airways to cancel all its flights until the end of the year is likely to add to the woes of an industry that has been struggling to stay afloat. While the pandemic continues to disrupt travel plans across the world, the airline industry is slowly coming to grips with the new reality. Despite facing significant challenges, carriers are exploring ways to operate safely amid the pandemic, with some implementing stringent measures such as mandatory face masks and temperature checks. In conclusion, the decision by British Airways to cancel all its flights until the end of the year highlights the severity of the current global health crisis. With several countries reporting a significant increase in cases, the move is seen as a necessary measure to curb the spread of COVID-19. While the WHO has declined to recommend any travel bans, it has called on governments to focus on implementing measures such as social distancing and hand hygiene, which are key to containing the virus.","(558, 20)","British Airways is suspending all of its flights between London and two West African nations
British Airways has announced that it will cancel all flights between London and Sierra Leone and Liberia until the end of the year. The decision comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a “public health emergency of international concern.”
The WHO has advised against non-essential travel to the affected countries, but British Airways says it will continue to operate flights to other destinations in West Africa. The airline says it is monitoring the situation closely and will provide updates as necessary.
The Ebola outbreak has killed more than 1,000 people in West Africa, and there are concerns that the virus could spread to other parts of the world. British Airways’ decision to suspend flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia is a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the virus.
The WHO has said that the risk of Ebola spreading to other countries is low, but it is important to take precautions to prevent the virus from spreading. British Airways says it is working closely with the WHO and other health authorities to ensure the safety of its passengers and crew.
British Airways is one of the world’s largest airlines, and its decision to cancel flights to two West African nations is a significant blow to the region’s economy. The Ebola outbreak has already had a devastating impact on the economies of Sierra Leone and Liberia, and the cancellation of flights will make it even harder for people to travel to and from these countries.
However, British Airways’ decision is also a sign of the seriousness of the Ebola outbreak. The airline is taking steps to protect its passengers and crew, and it is important that other airlines follow suit.
The Ebola outbreak is a serious threat to public health, and it is essential that everyone does their part to help prevent the further spread of the virus. By taking precautions and following the advice of health authorities, we can help to contain the outbreak and protect ourselves and our loved ones.
French government urges citizens to evacuate Sierra Leone
The French government has issued a travel warning for Sierra Leone, urging its citizens to leave the country as soon as possible. The warning comes in response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak, which has claimed over 1,000 lives in West Africa.
Sierra Leone is one of the countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic, and the French government is concerned about the safety of its citizens. In a statement, the French Foreign Ministry said that the situation in Sierra Leone is “deteriorating rapidly” and that the risk of infection is “very high.”
The French government has advised its citizens to avoid all travel to Sierra Leone, and to leave the country if they are already there. It has also set up a special hotline for French citizens in Sierra Leone who need assistance.
The Ebola outbreak began in Guinea in March, and has since spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. The virus is highly contagious and has a fatality rate of up to 90%. There is no vaccine or cure for Ebola, and the only way to prevent its spread is through strict isolation and quarantine measures.
The French government’s travel warning is a stark reminder of the dangers posed by the Ebola outbreak. It is essential that all countries take steps to contain the virus and protect their citizens.
The World Health Organization does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions
The World Health Organization has issued a statement saying that it does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade as a result of the Ebola outbreak.
The statement comes after several countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have imposed restrictions on travel to and from West Africa, where the outbreak is centered.
The WHO says that such restrictions are not necessary and could actually make the situation worse by preventing people from getting the help they need.
The organization says that the best way to prevent the spread of Ebola is through good hygiene and by avoiding contact with sick people.
The WHO also says that there is no evidence that Ebola can be spread through the air or through contaminated food or water.
The statement comes as the number of cases of Ebola continues to rise in West Africa. As of October 15, there have been more than 4,000 cases and more than 2,000 deaths.

","By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A quickly draining battery can be a pain for many iPhone users. But it turns out one of the most popular apps might be to blame. A former Apple Store Genius has unearthed evidence that the Facebook app is eating away at your phone’s juice. Is Facebook draining your battery? A former Apple Store employee has discovered that the popular third-party app runs processes in the battery that can decrease your phone's juice . According to Scotty Loveless from Overthought.org: 'I just got the iPhone 5s about two weeks ago, and thought my battery was draining a little too quickly. ‘Being the nerd that I am, I decided to run the app Instruments from Xcode, Apple’s developer tool, in order to see what the problem was. ‘During this testing, Facebook kept jumping up on the process list even thought I wasn’t using it. ‘So I tried disabling Location Services and Background App Refresh for Facbook.' Doing this, Loveless noticed that his battery percentage increased from 12% to 17%. Disable Background App Refresh for apps other than Facebook. Turn off push email. Stop push notifications from apps you don't use frequently. Turn on airplane mode when you haven't got a signal anyway. Stop closing apps, as your phone uses more battery each time it opens them again. ‘I have confirmed this behaviour on multiple iPhones with the same result,’ continues Loveless. ‘Bad, Facebook, bad.’ Fortunately, as Loveless points out, there is an easy fix. Navigating to Settings > Privacy > Location Services will enable you to turn off Location Services for Facebook. Then go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh to turn that functionality off for Facebook. One of the reasons for this might be that Facebook is introducing more features as it bids to become your number one communications service. This isn’t the first time Facebook has been caught causing phone users trouble, though . Previously in January MailOnline reported that the app was reading your texts, which the company claims is required for security reasons. You can turn off Location Services for Facebook within the iOS Settings menu to save battery life . Heading into your settings will also allow you to turn off 'Background App Refresh' for Facebook, saving more battery life but at the expense of not getting constant updates .","(450, 26)","A former Apple employee has discovered that Facebook may be the culprit behind your phone's quickly draining battery life. The social media giant's background processes on iPhones have been found to consume as much as 5% of your phone's battery, even when you are not actively using the app. While this feature keeps the app updated and enables push notifications, it may be worth disabling to help prolong your phone's battery life. The discovery was made by Matt Galligan, a former employee of Apple, who tweeted about his findings. He noted that he had disabled Facebook's background processes on his iPhone and found a significant improvement in battery performance. The background processes, also known as Background App Refresh, allow apps to update in the background even when you are not using them. This feature is convenient for keeping your apps up-to-date and receives push notifications when new content is available. However, these processes can also drain your phone's battery faster than usual. The issue is not exclusive to Facebook, and many other apps with background processes can have a similar effect on your phone's battery. Galligan, however, found that Facebook was one of the largest culprits responsible for draining phone batteries. Disabling Facebook's Background App Refresh feature is relatively easy to do. To turn off the feature, go to 'Settings' on your phone, then 'General,' and then 'Background App Refresh.' This will take you to a screen where you can either disable the feature for all apps or select specific apps to turn off. Disabling the feature may lead to longer battery life and a smoother performance of your iPhone. The discovery has come as a surprise to many iPhone users who have been struggling with the issue of fast-draining battery life. The ease with which this problem can be resolved has been well received by many, while others have criticized Facebook for not optimizing their app for better battery performance. In conclusion, Facebook's Background App Refresh feature has been responsible for draining the batteries of many iPhone users. Disabling the feature is an easy way to prolong your phone's battery life and can lead to better overall performance. It is a simple step that may help solve the problem of fast-draining batteries that trouble many iPhone users.","(426, 19)","By. Jonathan O'Callaghan. A quickly draining battery can be a pain for many
iPhone users, especially those who rely on their devices for work or other
important tasks. However, a recent discovery by a former Apple employee has
revealed that Facebook may be one of the culprits behind this issue. In this
article, we will delve into the details of this finding and explore how it
affects iPhone users.
According to the former Apple employee, Facebook's background processes on
iPhones are responsible for draining up to 5% of battery life per hour. These
processes keep the app updated and ensure that users receive push
notifications. While this may seem like a small percentage, it can add up
over time and significantly reduce the battery life of an iPhone.
However, turning off Facebook's background processes can help prolong the
battery life of an iPhone. By disabling these processes, users can prevent
the app from constantly running in the background and consuming valuable
battery power. This simple step can make a significant difference in the
overall performance and longevity of an iPhone.
It is important to note that disabling Facebook's background processes does
not affect the functionality of the app itself. Users will still be able to
use the app and receive notifications as usual. The only difference is that
the app will no longer be running in the background, which can help conserve
battery life.
In conclusion, a former Apple employee's discovery has shed light on how
Facebook's background processes can impact the battery life of iPhones. By
turning off these processes, iPhone users can extend the battery life of
their devices and avoid the frustration of a quickly draining battery. While
this may not completely eliminate the issue, it is a simple and effective
solution that can make a noticeable difference in the overall performance of
an iPhone.","(342, 17)","By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A quickly draining battery can be a pain for many

The NTSB continues to rule out mechanical causes in a deadly Bronx train crash while
","The NTSB continues to rule out mechanical causes in a deadly Bronx train crash while adding to the possibility that human error was involved. Federal safety investigators have all but eliminated mechanical problems as the cause of the December 1 derailment but added one more clue suggesting the engineer might not have been as attentive as he should have been. At 7:11 a.m. that Sunday -- about 11 minutes before the derailment -- the engineer did not dim the train's headlights as required when it passed another train, the National Transportation Safety Board said Monday. Engineer William Rockefeller Jr. acknowledged to investigators having a lapse in attention as the train approached a sharp curve, according Rockefeller's lawyer, Jeffrey Chartier, and his union representative.  The train's motion might have caused him to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed ""highway hypnosis."" Four people died and dozens were injured when the train, traveling at about 82 miles per hour, derailed on the curve, which has a 30 mph limit. The NTSB said Monday it believes that positive train control, a high-tech system that targets human error, could have prevented the crash.  The safety board has pushed the system for about 20 years.  Congress is requiring most major railroads, including Metro-North, to install the costly systems by the end of 2015. Railroad announces safety upgrades . The NTSB said it has completed its inspection of the train and found no anomalies. The ""dead-man"" switch -- a foot pedal that must be depressed to keep the train moving -- was also working, the board said.  Nor did it find problems with speed sensors, the brake control unit or the train's propulsion controller. The board reiterated that it found no problems with the tracks or the signal system. Finally, the board said it conducted a ""site/distance"" test and found no problems with visibility. ""As a result, at this time, the NTSB believes that if positive train control technology was installed on this line and train, it would have required the engineer to slow the train to an appropriate speed or stop the train in the event the engineer did not do so, likely preventing the derailment,"" the board said in a statement. Investigators are still awaiting results of crew drug tests and cellphone records, the board said, and it is continuing interviews with passengers, Metro-North employees who were riding on the train and first responders. Train crash victim was 'pure goodness,' widow says .","(464, 18)","Federal investigators looking into the tragic December 1 train accident in Washington have all but ruled out mechanical issues as the cause, according to a recent statement by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The accident, which left four people dead and dozens more injured, occurred when Amtrak's southbound train 501 derailed while traveling over a newly constructed section of track, sending several train cars plummeting onto a busy highway below. Since the incident, investigators have been working tirelessly to determine the cause of the derailment. While it was initially rumored that the accident may have been caused by a problem with the track, it has since been confirmed that there were no issues with the newly constructed segment. Now, after weeks of investigation, the NTSB has revealed that the cause of the accident can likely be attributed to human error. Specifically, they found that the train's engineer failed to follow standard protocol when passing another train on the same track. According to the report, the engineer failed to dim the train's lights, as required by industry regulations.  The failure to dim the lights may have temporarily blinded the engineer of the other train, causing the tragic derailment. As a result, the NTSB has announced that it plans to work closely with Amtrak officials to ensure that proper safety protocols are followed in the future. In the wake of the accident, Amtrak officials have expressed their condolences to those affected and have reiterated their commitment to safety. The company has also announced that it will be conducting an internal review of its safety policies and procedures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. Meanwhile, the families of those killed or injured in the accident have expressed their frustration with the investigation, noting that more needs to be done to prevent future tragedies. They have called on Amtrak officials to take more decisive action to address safety concerns and have urged lawmakers to pressure the industry to increase safety standards. As the investigation into the accident continues, it is clear that there are still many unanswered questions. However, one thing is certain - this tragic event has served as a stark reminder of just how important it is to prioritize safety in the transportation industry.","(416, 15)","The NTSB continues to rule out mechanical causes in a deadly Bronx train crash while

","By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:00 EST, 4 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:36 EST, 5 February 2013 . French airstrikes targeted fuel depots and bases of Islamist extremists in northern Mali yesterday, as the military intervention turns away from cities and toward the radicals’ desert outposts. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said on France-Inter radio yesterday that the strikes hit the Kidal region, near the border with Algeria, for the second night in a row. The extremists 'cannot stay there a long time unless they have ways to get new supplies,' he said. Intervention: A convoy of Malian troops makes a stop to test some of their weapons near Hambori, northern Mali, on the road to Gao, as the French led military operation continued, on Monday . Ready for action: French Troops dismount to secure a demining team clearing the road near Hambori, northern Mali, on the road to Gao, on Monday . French Mirage and Rafale planes also pounded extremist training camps as well as arms and fuel depots north of the town Kidal and in the Tessalit region. The French intervened in Mali on Jan. 11 to stem the advance of the al-Qaida-linked fighters, who had taken over much of the African country and enforced harsh rules on the population. After pushing extremists out of key cities, France is now pushing to hand over control of those sites to African forces from a U.N.-authorized force made up of thousands of troops from nearby countries. Frontline: French soldiers in a British made armored car lead a French supply convoy near Hambori, northern Mali, on the road to Gao, on Monday . Airstrikes: A convoy of French supplies reaches Gao, northern Mali, Monday, while French troops launched airstrikes on Islamic militant training camps and arms depots around Kidal and Tessalit in Mali's far north . 'In the cities that we are holding we want to be quickly replaced by the African forces,' Fabius said Monday. Asked whether the French could pull out of the fabled city of Timbuktu and hand it to African forces as soon as Tuesday, Fabius responded, . 'Yes, it could happen very fast. We are working on it because our vocation is not to stay in the long term.' But it is far from clear that the African forces - much less the weak Malian army - are ready to see the thousands of French troops, fighter planes and helicopters withdraw and take full responsibility, in case the Islamic extremists attempt a comeback from their desert hideouts.","(477, 22)","In a recent series of airstrikes in the desert region of the troubled country, fighter jets have targeted the remote outposts and fuel depots of violent extremists. According to reports, Mirage and Rafale planes have relentlessly pounded the training camps of radical groups.  The strikes, which have claimed multiple lives, were reportedly carried out in coordination with the local security forces. This comes as a significant blow to the rebels who have long operated with impunity in the vast, desert terrain.  Sources stated that the operation was specifically designed to disrupt insurgent activities and choke off their supply lines. The extremists have been using the desert outposts as a base to launch attacks against the state and civilian populations. With the destruction of their fuel depots, the rebels are now expected to face a significant challenge in sustaining their operations.  The Mirage and Rafale planes involved in the operation are known for their precision strikes and maneuverability, making them ideal for carrying out such missions. The use of modern technology and techniques in the operation also ensured minimal collateral damage and civilian casualties. Moreover, the operation has demonstrated the government's commitment to rooting out extremist elements in the country. The use of air power is a clear indication that the government has adopted a more aggressive stance against violent extremism. The airstrikes come at a time when the security situation in the country has been deteriorating, with a rise in attacks by insurgents. The rebels have been targeting government officials and installations, as well as civilian populations, in a bid to destabilize the country. The government has been grappling with this issue for years, and the latest operation is expected to provide a much-needed boost to the authorities. The operation has also sent a strong message to the rebels, indicating that the government will not tolerate any attempt to challenge the state's authority. The security forces have been put on high alert, and further operations are expected in the coming weeks to eliminate the remaining extremist elements. In conclusion, the recent airstrikes targeting the radicals' desert outposts and fuel depots have severely impacted the rebels' capabilities to conduct their operations. The use of advanced fighter jets and modern techniques in the operation has demonstrated the government's resolve to combat violent extremism. With the security forces on high alert, the government is expected to continue its crackdown on the insurgents in a bid to stabilize the situation in the country.","(449, 19)","By.

Airstrikes focused on radicals’ desert outposts, fuel depots and training camps in a bid to cripple the al-Qa’ida-linked group’s ability to carry out attacks in the region.
The strikes were carried out by Mirage 2000 and Rafale fighter jets from France and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Apache attack helicopters from the United States.
The airstrikes were carried out in coordination with the Algerian military, which has been battling militants in the region since 2007.
The Algerian military said the strikes targeted ‘extremist training camps’ and ‘fuel depots’ used by the militants.
Algeria’s state news agency APS reported that the strikes also targeted ‘desert outposts’ used by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).
AQIM has been blamed for a number of deadly attacks in Algeria in recent years, including the 2013 attack on the In Amenas gas plant in which 40 foreign hostages were killed.
The group has also been blamed for the 2011 attack on the U.S. consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.
French President Francois Hollande said in a statement that the strikes were ‘an act of self-defence’.
He added: ‘Algeria is a key partner in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel and the Maghreb.’
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said the strikes were a ‘coup de grâce’ to the terrorists.
He said: ‘These strikes are a coup de grâce to the terrorists who have been trying to destabilise our country for a long time.’
He added that the strikes would ‘contribute to stabilising the situation in the region’.
The strikes are the latest in a series of military operations against al-Qaeda-linked groups in North Africa and the Middle East.
The United States has carried out a number of drone strikes in the region in recent years.
In 2011, the United States launched a drone strike that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born al-Qaeda leader, in Yemen.
In December 2012, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution authorising the use of military force in Libya.
In January 2013, the U.N. Security Council authorised the use of ‘all necessary measures’ to protect civilians in Syria.","(428, 19)","By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 18:00 EST, 4 February 2013. |

The Royal Navy launched an unarmed warhead in an awe-inspiring display of Britain's powerful nuclear
","The Royal Navy launched an unarmed warhead in an awe-inspiring display of Britain's powerful nuclear deterrent. The Trident II was blasted into the sky by HMS Vigilant, a nuclear-powered Vanguard Class submarine, in the Atlantic just off the coast of Florida. The Navy has not test-fired a ballistic missile since 2009. Navy chiefs said the successful launch confirms the credibility of the UK's nuclear deterrent. Scroll down for video . Launch: A still taken from video of the missile firing from HMS Vigilant . Soaring: The missile streaks into the sky over the Atlantic Ocean . First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope said: 'The Royal Navy has for over 43 years continuously operated the UK’s nuclear deterrent to stringent safety standards and HMS Vigilant’s latest test firing before she returns to the patrol cycle reflects that successful deterrence is based upon strong determination. 'One of the core roles of the Royal Navy, the Continuous At Sea Deterrent remains an enduring strategic capability, underpinning our nation’s commitment to the preservation of peace in our uncertain world.' News of the launch comes at the same time Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced an additional £350M worth of funding for the next stage of design work for Successor, the future generation of UK nuclear-armed submarines. Ready: HMS Vigilant preparing to fire an unarmed Trident II. The launch was the first of its type in three years . Tension: The sub's weapons engineering officer pulling the trigger to fire the missile . He added that the investment will sustain 1,200 UK jobs and makes clear the Government’s commitment to maintaining a deterrence for future decades. The funding follows the initial £350M of design work announced earlier this year. The Vanguard submarines will be replaced from 2028 by the Successor, which is currently being designed by British companies. Britain's nuclear subs are based at Faslane on the River Clyde in Scotland and uncertainty surrounds its future should the Scottish vote for independence in 2014. The SNP wants to remove the subs from the site, bhe Royal Navy says all Royal Navy submarines will be based at Faslane by 2017, including the Astute and Trafalgar class attack submarines. The successful launch took place off the coast of Florida in the U.S. and used America's telemetry and tracking systems . Mr Hammond claims the site is secure. He said: 'We are confident that the Scottish people will choose to remain part of the United Kingdom. 'The Faslane complex is the largest employment site in Scotland with over 6,500 jobs underpinning the local economy. 'We have no plans to move the nuclear deterrent from the Clyde. On the contrary, we intend to move the Astute and Trafalgar Class attack submarines to Faslane, creating a further 1,500 jobs. 'The Scottish Government needs to explain how their policy would benefit Scotland’s economy and safeguard Scottish jobs.' VIDEO: HMS Vigilant fires an unarmed Trident ballistic missile during a test launch .","(543, 26)","The Royal Navy successfully conducted its first missile test in three years, confirming the credibility of Britain's nuclear deterrent. The test, which took place on a firing range in the Atlantic Ocean, was conducted using a Trident II D5 missile fired from HMS Vengeance.  The missile was launched from a submerged position off the coast of Florida, and successfully hit its target more than 4,000 miles away on the coast of West Africa. The successful test has been seen as a significant milestone in the Royal Navy's efforts to maintain its nuclear deterrent capabilities.  The test came amid growing concerns over the future of the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine base in Scotland. The base, which is located at Faslane on the Clyde, has been at the center of a political dispute between the Scottish National Party and the British government.  Despite the uncertainty over the future of the base, the Navy has underlined its commitment to maintaining its nuclear deterrent. In a statement following the test, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense said: ""The successful launch of a Trident II D5 missile by HMS Vengeance is a testament to the skill and professionalism of the Royal Navy. This test underlines our unwavering commitment to maintaining the credibility and effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent, and sending a powerful message to potential adversaries."" The test was also hailed as a significant achievement by senior military officials. Former Royal Navy Rear Admiral Chris Parry told BBC News that the test was a ""massive result"" for the Navy. ""It's been a difficult year for the Royal Navy, with budget cuts and concerns over the future of the submarine base in Scotland,"" he said. ""But this test demonstrates that the Navy remains a world-class force, capable of projecting power around the globe."" The test came just days after the Ministry of Defense announced that it had reached a deal with US firm Bechtel to manage the construction of a new nuclear submarine base in Scotland. The deal, which is worth around £500 million, is intended to ensure that the Royal Navy can continue to operate its nuclear deterrent from Scottish waters in the event that the Faslane base becomes unusable. Despite the positive news, the future of the Royal Navy's nuclear deterrent remains uncertain. The Scottish National Party has made it clear that it intends to seek independence from the UK, and has previously signalled its opposition to the presence of nuclear weapons on Scottish soil. However, the successful missile test has been hailed as a major boost for the Navy's morale and credibility. It is also likely to reassure the UK's allies and partners, who have expressed concern over the uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK's nuclear deterrent. Overall, the successful test launch of the Trident II D5 missile has underlined the Royal Navy's unwavering commitment to maintaining its nuclear deterrent capabilities. While the future of the Faslane base remains uncertain, the Navy has demonstrated that it is capable of projecting power and maintaining its position as a world-class force.","(567, 21)","The Royal Navy launched an unarmed warhead in an awe-inspiring display of Britain's powerful nuclear

sub base in Scotland, arguing that it would be incompatible with the country's commitment to nuclear
disarmament. The UK government, however, has argued that a new sub base is necessary to ensure that the
Royal Navy can continue to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent.
The debate over the location of a new sub base has been ongoing for several years, and the launch of the
Trident missile has only served to highlight the importance of the issue. The Royal Navy has made it clear
that it needs a new sub base in order to maintain its nuclear deterrent, and the UK government has argued
that Scotland is the best location for such a base. However, the Scottish government remains opposed to the
idea, and the issue is likely to remain a source of tension between the two governments in the coming years.

Japanese police investigating a so-called ""Black Widow"" who could be behind the deaths of six
","Japanese police investigating a so-called ""Black Widow"" who could be behind the deaths of six partners have found traces of cyanide in soil from her pot plants, reports said Friday. Chisako Kakehi, 68, who was arrested last month on suspicion of murdering her 75-year-old spouse, received one billion yen (£5.4million) in insurance and other payouts over 10 years following the deaths of husbands and lovers, media have said. Police believe she killed Isao - her fourth and most recent husband - with cyanide in December last year. Japanese woman Chisako Kakehi has reportedly received £5.4million over the last two decades -- in the form of insurance payments and other assets she received after the deaths of her seven partners . Investigators who tested plant pots she had taken to a recycling centre about six months after her husband died discovered a bag at the bottom of a planter. Lab results showed the presence of cyanide compounds, according to Kyodo News. Since the death from illness of her first husband in 1994, Kakehi had reportedly been involved with more than 10 men, six of whom had perished. Reports say that most were elderly or ill and she was deliberately targeting unattached wealthy men as part of a plan to get insurance payouts or to inherit their assets. Kakehi has denied murder. Cyanide was found in the body of at least one of the men she was involved with before her recent marriage. Police who earlier raided her home in Kyoto found traces of cyanide in the rubbish, media said. They also found paraphernalia for administering drugs and medical books at an apartment she kept south of Kyoto. Japanese police probing a so-called 'Black Widow' who could be behind the deaths of six partners have found traces of cyanide in soil from her pot plants.","(329, 13)","Chisako Kakehi, a 70-year-old Japanese woman, was apprehended by police last month on charges of murder. Investigators suspect that Kakehi poisoned her fourth husband, Toshiaki Suehiro, with cyanide last December. Police officials became suspicious of Kakehi after traces of cyanide were discovered in her garbage in 2013. The authorities' suspicion was validated when it was found that all of Kakehi's previous partners had died soon after tying the knot with her. Incredibly, she has been married to at least eight men, and seven have died under mysterious circumstances. Kakehi's motive for committing these heinous acts is financial gain, according to the authorities. She was nicknamed the 'Black Widow' by the Japanese media for her shady track record. Despite Kakehi's initial denial, she eventually admitted to killing her fourth husband. Kakehi said that she decided to kill Toshiaki Suehiro because of a conflict over finances. The police are investigating if Kakehi was involved in the deaths of her other partners as well. The investigation is centered around determining whether Kakehi had some direct or indirect involvement in the death of her former partners. The people of Japan were in shock following Kakehi's arrest. While it is not unusual for criminal networks to operate in the country, the case of Chisako Kakehi was different. People were astounded by the fact that someone could be so ruthless and manipulative, particularly someone who appeared to be a well-respected member of society. Kakehi is currently in police custody and is awaiting trial. The authorities are optimistic they will be able to piece together Kakehi's connections to investigate the matter thoroughly. The communities of Japan continue to grapple with the heart-wrenching reality that what appears to be fairy tale marriages often hide an ugly truth. Some citizens hope that Kakehi's case will stimulate more awareness about scams that target vulnerable people, particularly the elderly.","(345, 18)","Japanese police investigating a so-called ""Black Widow"" who could be behind the deaths of six

A simple saliva test was yesterday hailed as the holy grail in the early detection
","A simple saliva test was yesterday hailed as the holy grail in the early detection of deadly diseases such as cancer. It could also apply to dementia, Alzheimer’s, type 2 diabetes and auto-immune diseases, the researchers said. The study, the most comprehensive analysis ever conducted of a particular type of molecules in human saliva, reveals that saliva contains many of the same disease-revealing molecules that are in blood. A simple saliva test could be the best new way to test for early signs of cancer and other diseases, researchers have claimed (file image) Dentists may soon be able to take saliva samples to analyse for disease. The report’s lead author Dr David Wong, a dental expert at the University of California in Los Angeles, said the research could lead to self-diagnostic devices. 'If we can define the boundaries of molecular targets in saliva, then we can ask what the constituents in saliva are that can mark someone who has pre-diabetes or the early stages of oral cancer or pancreatic cancer - and we can utilise this knowledge for personalised medicine. 'If you don’t look in saliva, you may miss important indicators of disease. There seems to be treasure in saliva, which will surprise people. ‘This could indicate that wearable gear that informs you whether you have a disease – even before you have any symptoms – is almost here,’ he said. Many of the molecules visible in cancer patients' blood could be identified in saliva, researchers discovered (file image of a human cancer cell) Dr Wong's laboratory discovered that some of the same RNA that is inside human cells are also present in saliva and can be used to detect diseases - a surprising finding, he said, because enzymes in saliva can degrade RNA, making the mouth “a hostile environment. The new research involved analysing 165 million genetic sequences, details of which are published in the scientific journal Clinical Chemistry.","(363, 11)","A new study has found that certain molecules in human saliva can be used as indicators for various health conditions, including dementia, Alzheimer's, and type 2 diabetes. The research, conducted by a team of scientists at the University of Alberta in Canada, tested a particular type of molecule found in saliva and discovered that many of the same indicators found in blood are present in the mouth as well. The study involved examining the levels of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in saliva, which are small sacs containing molecules that can be exchanged between cells. The researchers found that these molecules can be used to track changes in inflammation, which is known to be a factor in a wide range of health conditions. By examining the levels of EVs in saliva, they were able to identify various health indicators and predict the progression of conditions such as Alzheimer's, dementia, and type 2 diabetes. The researchers believe that this new method of testing saliva could be a game changer in the diagnosis of these and other health conditions, as it is non-invasive and easy to administer. It could potentially replace the need for blood tests, which can be more expensive and require more equipment. Dr. Naweed Syed, a professor at the University of Alberta and co-author of the study, said, ""We believe that this new method of testing saliva could revolutionize the way we diagnose and monitor a wide range of health conditions. By examinig these molecules in saliva, we can quickly and easily identify potential health issues and take appropriate action."" There is still much work to be done in this area, as the researchers acknowledge that additional testing is needed to validate their findings. However, the potential benefits of this new testing method are clear. It could make it easier for healthcare providers to diagnose and monitor a wide range of health conditions, ultimately leading to better health outcomes for patients. In conclusion, this new research has discovered that particular molecules in human saliva can serve as indicators of health conditions, including dementia, Alzheimer's, and type 2 diabetes. This testing method is non-invasive and easy to administer, making it a potential game changer for the diagnosis and monitoring of various health conditions. While additional testing is needed, the potential benefits of this new method are clear, and it could eventually lead to better health outcomes for patients.","(444, 15)","A simple saliva test was yesterday hailed as the holy grail in the early detection

(CNN) -- Reactions to Miley Cyrus at the VMAs: People are still having them! Earlier
","(CNN) -- Reactions to Miley Cyrus at the VMAs: People are still having them! Earlier this week, we heard what both Britney Spears and Paula Patton had to say about the performance. (Spoiler alert: They think she's just being Miley.) But while both those stars were shrugging their shoulders, another music legend was sharpening her claws. ""I'm not old-fashioned,"" Cher told USA Today in an interview published Tuesday. ""She could have come out naked, and if she'd just rocked the house, I would have said, 'You go, girl.' It just wasn't done well. She can't dance, her body looked like hell, the song wasn't great, one cheek was hanging out. And, chick, don't stick out your tongue if it's coated."" EW: Paula Patton reacts to Miley Cyrus' VMAs performance . Ouch! It's one thing to slam Miley's choice of outfit or sexually-charged behavior; it's quite another to question the girl's talent itself. And coming from someone who knows a thing or two about rockin' it while wearing revealing outfits — not to mention clearly visible buttocks — that comment is harsher still. EW: Britney Spears defends Miley Cyrus on 'GMA', plus 4 other things we learned . Evidently, Cyrus is taking Cher's burn in stride. She hasn't responded to Cher's words on social media, choosing instead to keep touting the phenomenal success of ""Wrecking Ball,"" her latest single. (""#1 on Billboard. #1 on iTunes. #1 on Spotify. #1 on Streaming. #1 on Digital songs. #1 most added to pop radio. #1 on VEVO,"" according to Miley.) And maybe it was the young star's high-road tactics — not to mention a barrage of criticism about her criticism — that prompted Cher to backtrack on Twitter yesterday. ""What I should have said [is],""I didn't like it that much,but she's Pushing The Envelope,being an ARTIST !"" the Oscar winner wrote. ""She's Talented,& DIDNT COMMIT A FELONY[.]"" Good points all, Cher — though some might argue that ""flicking that tongue as deamons do"" should be grounds for at least a time-out. See the original story at EW.com.","(455, 29)","Pop icons Cher and Miley Cyrus have been making headlines over the past few days after Cher made comments at the 2019 Kennedy Center Honors that caused controversy. During her tribute to honoree Cyrus, Cher remarked, ""I just wanted to see what she was going to wear tonight. So I came in behind her, and I was dressed in something that was like a Bodysuit. And chain mail. And then she come out naked, and if she'd just rocked the house, I would've said 'yeah'"".  These comments were met with mixed reactions, with many fans of both women feeling that Cher's words were inappropriate and objectifying towards Cyrus. Some pointed out that Cyrus has been vocal about how her past experiences with being oversexualized have affected her, and that Cher's comments seemed to perpetuate that.  However, Cher has since taken to Twitter to clarify her remarks and show support for Cyrus. In a tweet posted on December 16th, the pop legend wrote, ""Re: Miley Cyrus I Think What I Think,&  I Say What I say! I'd  Rather Be  Hated For Who Iam Than  Loved For Who I'm Not‼️&  I’m  a  little  Scared Of  ppl Who R So Suportive they  R  scarry .😂. Everything  is Great Between Us 'SHE'S FABULOUS' .  Despite the controversy, it's clear that both Cher and Cyrus have a lot of respect for each other. During the Kennedy Center Honors, Cher spoke at length about how much she admires Cyrus, saying, ""I'm here to sing the praises, actually scream the praises, of...a woman who has been at the forefront of a fight, a fight for LGBTQ rights, for gender equality, and for the simple notion that we are all born naked and the rest is just drag."" For her part, Cyrus has also been vocal about how much Cher means to her. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, the ""Wrecking Ball"" singer talked about how she used to impersonate Cher as a child and how much it meant to her when the pop icon called her to collaborate on a song. ""She's always been very supportive of me,"" Cyrus said. ""She's always been there for me."" The controversy surrounding Cher's comments at the Kennedy Center Honors highlights the ongoing conversation around feminism and the male gaze in the entertainment industry. While some argue that Cyrus's choice to perform in provocative outfits is empowering, others feel that it perpetuates harmful stereotypes about female performers. Regardless of one's opinions on the matter, it's clear that both Cher and Cyrus are talented artists who have had a big impact on the music industry.","(513, 20)","(CNN) -- Reactions to Miley Cyrus at the VMAs: People are still having them!

However, there are a few areas where the article could be improved. First, it would be
helpful to provide more context for readers who may not be familiar with the VMAs or the
controversy surrounding Cyrus' performance. For example, it would be helpful to briefly
explain what the VMAs are and why they are significant in the music industry. Additionally,
it would be helpful to provide more background information on Cyrus herself, such as her
age, career, and personal life. This would help readers better understand the context of
her performance and the reactions to it.
Second, the article could benefit from more analysis and interpretation. While it provides a
detailed account of the events, it does not offer much in the way of analysis or
interpretation. For example, the article could explore the cultural and societal
implications of Cyrus' performance, such as how it reflects changing attitudes towards
sexuality and gender in popular culture. Additionally, the article could analyze the
reactions to Cyrus' performance from different perspectives, such as how they reflect
different values and beliefs in society.

","(CNN) -- An autopsy report issued Friday by Hillsborough County, Florida, cites cocaine as a contributing factor in the death of TV pitchman Billy Mays, who died in June at age 50. The Hillsborough County medical examiner's office said cocaine use contributed to Billy Mays' heart disease. ""Mays died from a lethal arrhythmia of the heart caused by hypertensive and arteriosclerotic heart disease,"" the county said in a statement attributed to Dr. Leszek Chrostowski, the associate medical examiner who conducted the autopsy. ""He further concluded that cocaine use caused or contributed to the development of his heart disease, and therefore contributed to his death,"" it added. The fact that toxicology tests detected only breakdown products of cocaine, not the drug itself, led Chrostowski to conclude that Mays had used cocaine ""in the few days prior to death but not immediately prior to death."" Cocaine is a stimulant that can raise blood pressure and thicken the wall of the left ventricle of the heart, one of the organ's four main pumping chambers. The autopsy also found low concentrations of ethyl alcohol ""consistent with social consumption of a few beverages"" as well as the narcotic drugs hydrocodone, oxycodone and tramadol. Mays had prescriptions for the drugs -- which were found in therapeutic or subtherapeutic concentrations -- to ease hip pain. In addition, the tests found evidence of two tranquilizers -- alprazolam (Xanax) and diazepam (Valium) -- which are commonly prescribed for a variety of ailments, including anxiety and insomnia. Both drugs were determined to be in therapeutic or subtherapeutic concentrations. Mays was found dead at his home near Tampa on June 28. Mays, with his booming voice, was famous for fronting products such as OxiClean and Orange Glo in TV commercials.","(333, 12)","Television pitchman Billy Mays' sudden death in June left millions of fans in shock. He was just 50 years old at the time of his passing. An autopsy report released on Friday has revealed that cocaine use played a role in his death. Although it was heart disease that ultimately claimed Mays' life, the report states that cocaine use contributed to his illness. The report further reveals that traces of cocaine were found in Mays' system at the time of his death. The autopsy also showed evidence of hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease, which can lead to sudden heart attacks or stroke. The report states that the excessive use of cocaine likely put a significant strain on Mays' heart and worsened his pre-existing heart condition. Mays' wife, who commissioned the autopsy, said in a statement that she hoped the report would help others learn from her husband's tragic demise. She urged people who struggle with addiction to seek help and get properly treated. Mays' passing sent shockwaves through the advertising industry, where he was a well-known and respected figure. He became a household name after appearing on several popular TV infomercials, most notably for OxiClean and Orange Glo cleaning products. He was known for his energetic and enthusiastic sales pitches, which made him a beloved figure to many. The news of Mays' drug use has saddened fans and colleagues alike, but it has also highlighted the dangers of substance abuse. The report underscores the need for more education and awareness about the risks of drug use, particularly for those with pre-existing health conditions. Mays' legacy lives on as a household name and a symbol of success in the advertising industry. However, his untimely death serves as a stark reminder that addiction can claim even the most successful and high-profile individuals.","(335, 16)","(CNN) -- An autopsy report issued Friday by Hillsborough County, Florida, cites cocaine as a

BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Protesters across Iraq Tuesday urged government authorities to free the TV
","BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Protesters across Iraq Tuesday urged government authorities to free the TV correspondent who threw his shoes at President Bush. TV reporter Muntadhar al-Zaidi, shown in a file photo, was jailed after throwing his shoes at President Bush. Hundreds of students at Diyala University in Baquba carried banners demanding the release of Muntadhar al-Zaidi -- described by demonstrators as an ""honorable Iraqi."" Smaller protests emerged in the Anbar province city of Falluja and in two Baghdad locations -- Baghdad University in the northern part of the city and western Baghdad's Ameriya district. In those events, students also took to the streets. Al-Zaidi threw his shoes at Bush while Bush and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki were holding a Sunday news conference after the president's surprise visit to Baghdad. The journalist was dragged to the ground, hustled out of the room and arrested. Shouting as he was dragged to the floor, the reporter called his shoe-throwing -- a traditional insult in Arab culture -- a ""farewell kiss"" to a ""dog"" who launched the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  Watch Muntadhar al-Zaidi throw his shoes at Bush » . Dhirgham al-Zaidi, the shoe-thrower's brother, said the journalist hated the ""material American occupation"" and Iranian influence in Iraq. Asked about the incident by CNN's Candy Crowley, Bush said, ""I didn't have much time to reflect on anything. I was ducking and dodging."" He said the journalist was ""looking for notoriety"" and that authorities shouldn't overreact in their treatment of him. TV networks across the world continue to air the shoe-throwing scene, which has touched a nerve in the Arab world, where there has been an outpouring of support for al-Zaidi -- a correspondent for the Egyptian-based Al-Baghdadia TV. The network, which has been airing rolling live coverage about the incident, is urging his release and has invited guests who support him into its studio.  Watch Arab reaction to the incident » . Its crawls include messages of support from Iraqis and foreigners. Iraqis have been receiving short text messages of support on their cell phones, and some of the notes are short poems. Al-Baghdadia reported Tuesday al-Zaidi called one of his brothers and said he was in the custody of judicial authorities and will appear Wednesday in Baghdad's Central Criminal Court. He asked his defense team to meet him there, the network said. Web sites and Facebook pages devoted to al-Zaidi have also been posted.","(459, 21)","Former US President George W. Bush has dismissed the actions of Muntadhar al-Zaidi, the Iraqi journalist who infamously threw his shoes at him during a press conference in 2008, as just an attempt to gain notoriety. Speaking with Fox News, Bush stated that al-Zaidi was ""just a guy that was trying to get on TV and he got on TV.""  Bush's comments were made in response to a recent gathering of hundreds of students in the streets of Baghdad, who carried banners calling for the release of al-Zaidi. The demonstrators described him as an ""honorable Iraqi"" who had simply expressed the frustration and anger felt by many in the country towards American influence.  However, al-Zaidi's own brother has now shed new light on the journalist's actions that day. In an interview with Reuters, Durgham al-Zaidi stated that Muntadhar had long harbored deep feelings of animosity towards both American and Iranian influence in Baghdad.  ""His point was not just about President Bush,"" said Durgham al-Zaidi. ""It was about the destruction of Iraq, about the humiliation of the Iraqi people. It was about the killing of innocent people.""  Muntadhar al-Zaidi's shoe-throwing incident quickly captured the attention of the world's media, and the journalist was hailed as a hero by many in the Arab world who saw the act as a symbol of resistance against American aggression.  Although al-Zaidi was initially sentenced to three years in prison for assaulting a foreign head of state, the sentence was later reduced to one year and he was released for good behavior after serving just nine months.  Many Iraqis continue to view al-Zaidi as a martyr for their cause, and his shoe-throwing incident remains a potent symbol of resistance against the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq.  Bush's dismissal of al-Zaidi's actions as attention-seeking drew criticism from some quarters. ""The fact that Bush would still try to dismiss al-Zaidi's actions as a publicity stunt just shows how little he understands about the suffering of the Iraqi people under his leadership,"" said one Iraqi commentator.  Despite the passage of over a decade since the incident, Muntadhar al-Zaidi remains a controversial figure, with many in Iraq continuing to view him as a symbol of resistance against foreign aggression.","(417, 15)","BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Protesters across Iraq Tuesday urged government authorities to free the TV

New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Dozens of police officers were involved in a gunbattle with
","New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Dozens of police officers were involved in a gunbattle with rebel Maoists in the rain-drenched forests of eastern India Wednesday, police reported. Security forces had been tracking the insurgents when a shootout erupted in Chhattisgarh state's Dantewada region, police spokesman Rajesh Mishra told CNN. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but reinforcements were rushed to the scene, Mishra added. India regards Maoist rebels as its gravest internal security threat. Until June this year, authorities blamed 1,103 violent attacks in the country on left-wing extremists. More than 200 officers and 97 rebels were killed during that period, federal home minister P. Chidambaram said last month. Police have also arrested at least 1,341 suspected Maoists. ""These figures underscore the gravity of the challenge posed by left-wing extremism,"" Chidambaram said. In April, more than 70 officers were killed in Dantewada in an ambush -- one of the deadliest attacks on Indian security forces by suspected guerrillas. Officials say Maoists aim to seize political power through what they call a protracted people's war. On their part, the insurgents have claimed since the 1960s to be fighting for the dispossessed. Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh conceded last year that the nation's fight with the rebels had fallen short of objectives. Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities but also among youth and the intelligentsia, officials suspect. ""We have not achieved as much success as we would have liked in containing this menace,"" Singh said last September. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call ""class enemies,"" the rebels are also believed to be attacking infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks. India says it has adopted a two-pronged strategy -- involving development and police action in Maoist strongholds -- to deal with the problem. Yet, Chidambaram in his statement in July this year accepted the planning has delivered mixed results. While forces stopped many attacks and apprehended key Maoist leaders, the guerrillas too have been successful in carrying out serious assaults in several instances, he noted.","(400, 18)","In a region where dozens of police officers lost their lives in April, a new fight has erupted once again. Gunfire could be heard echoing through the streets as militants battled against Indian security forces in a remote area of the country. According to reports, the gun battle lasted several hours but casualty figures are yet to be confirmed. Given the fact that this region has been a hotbed for militant activity, the latest skirmish highlights the challenges this country faces in its fight against extremism. India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been vocal in his pledge to eradicate terrorism from his country. However, he has recently admitted that the country has not yet achieved its desired level of success in its fight against militants. In a speech earlier this year, Modi said: ""Terror and terrorists continue to access funds, resources, and arms from across our borders."" These weapons and supplies continue to fuel the militant groups that have carried out numerous attacks across India over the years. The region where the latest gun battle took place is known to be a stronghold for a range of extremist groups, including militant groups from Pakistan. Despite the ongoing struggle, India remains committed to its fight against terrorism. The country has also called on the international community to work together to combat extremism around the world. In recent years, India has increased its counter-terrorism efforts significantly. It has also implemented new laws and regulations to help combat terrorist financing and other forms of support for extremist groups.

The gunbattle took place in Srinagar, the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir,

the safety and security of the people of the region.

police officers who were patrolling the area. The officers returned fire, and the
gunbattle lasted for several hours before the militants were able to escape.
No one was injured in the gunbattle, but the incident has raised concerns about the

recent months, and the government has been struggling to contain the violence.

Initially, they didn't take it seriously and joked that they were ""bringing the roof down"" with their performance. However, the scale of the accident became quickly apparent and it turned out to be a major problem. The band members shared their experience and claimed that they had ""no clue what had happened"" at first. According to the eyewitnesses, the ceiling started crumbling right above the stage, causing panic among the crowd. Fortunately, no one was injured during the incident. The band, who was in the middle of their set, had to immediately stop playing and evacuate the stage. The concert was abruptly ended and the audience was evacuated safely out of the venue. The incident also caused significant damage to the stage and equipment, leaving the venue's technical team to handle and assess the damage caused by the ceiling collapse. Following the accident, the venue's management extended their apology to the band and fans. They are also investigating the cause behind the collapse and have assured that they will take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of their patrons. Esperanza has not yet released any official statement about the incident. The fans and other musicians took to social media to express their relief about the lack of injuries and concern over the band's well-being. The incident has raised questions about the safety of music venues and the need for regular maintenance checks to ensure the building is secure for such events.

","By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:52 EST, 7 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:56 EST, 7 September 2013 . Online retail giant Amazon is considering offering its much-anticipated smartphone for free, it has been reported. The retailer is understood to be aiming to 'undercut rivals' and 'grab a meaningful market share' by tempting consumers using iPhones and Galaxy phones - which normally cost about $200 (£127) - to switch to their free version. However, it is thought the company, which is already behind the hugely popular Kindle e-reader, may require its smartphone users to sign up to services such as its loyalty programme, Amazon Prime. 'Apple's nightmare': If Amazon, which is already behind the popular Kindle e-reader (right) can conquer the market with free phones, Apple may be forced to lower the prices on its iPhone (left) Technology blogger Jessica Lessin claims that 'people familiar with Amazon's effort' confirmed the company was considering offering the smartphones for free. But it is expected to come with some strings attached. 'One of them is whether Amazon would require its smartphone owners to . pay for services such as Amazon Prime, the company’s loyalty program,' Lessin writes in her blog. 'But the people familiar with the matter said that Amazon wants the . device to be free whether or not people sign up for a new wireless plan . at the same time. (Wireless carriers typically discount the price of . devices if customers sign up for a one or two-year wireless contract.)' Cost: Smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy typically cost about $200 (£127) One of the sources says Amazon - which is yet to throw its hat into the smartphone game but is rumored to be interested in doing so - has been in communication with wireless service providers about offering the phone on other carriers. The phone, however, would be offered directly to consumers through a website. Lessin said the free strategy 'isn't set in stone - it depends on a few things that Amazon still needs to work out. For example, the company will need to figure out the financial arrangements with hardware suppliers who are actually manufacturing the phones - something one of Lessin's sources isn't entirely sure is feasible. Free? Amazon is rumored to be considering undercutting its competitors when it enters the smartphone market by offering free phones . Lessin claims that regardless of whether Amazon phones end up being free, or cost significantly less than other, similar phones, the mere fact that the company is considering the strategy indicates how it plans to get into the phone business: 'undercut rivals and grab meaningful market share.' If it works, other smartphone companies could potentially be forced to follow suit and offer their products for much lower prices, or even for free. Lessin described the scenario as 'Apple's Nightmare.'","(544, 28)","Amazon is reportedly gearing up to take on smartphone giants Apple and Samsung in the highly competitive smartphone market. According to industry experts, the e-commerce giant is planning to ""undercut rivals and grab meaningful market share"" in the smartphone market. As Amazon continues to diversify its product offerings, this move would mark the company's latest push into consumer electronics. While it is too early to say when Amazon's smartphone will hit the market, the company has reportedly been working on the project for some time now. If Amazon can successfully lure people away from Apple and Samsung technology, it could spell trouble for these tech giants. In response to Amazon's entry into the market, they may be forced to lower their prices to compete. The smartphone market has traditionally been dominated by Apple and Samsung, with other competitors struggling to even make a dent in their market share. However, with Amazon's vast resources and reach, experts believe that the company could break the current duopoly. Amazon's reputation for offering products at lower prices than its competitors is well-known. If the company can maintain this strategy with its new smartphone, it could potentially become a major player in the market. In addition, Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa, could differentiate its smartphone from its competitors. While Amazon's previous foray into the smartphone market with its Fire phone in 2014 was unsuccessful, the company has made significant strides in the consumer electronics space since then. The company's Amazon Echo smart speaker, which is powered by Alexa, has become an instant hit and has cemented Amazon's position as the leader in the smart home space. Amazon's entry into the smartphone market could also have implications for wireless carriers. Currently, carriers offer subsidies to make smartphones more affordable for consumers. If Amazon's smartphone is priced lower, carriers may be forced to rethink their strategy, which could have significant implications for the industry. It remains to be seen when Amazon's smartphone will hit the market and how it will be received by consumers. However, the company's track record in disrupting markets cannot be ignored. From bookselling to streaming video, Amazon has shown that it is not afraid to take on the biggest players in any industry. If Amazon can successfully undercut its rivals and grab meaningful market share in the highly competitive smartphone market, it could be a game-changer for the industry.","(452, 20)","By.

Amazon is planning to undercut rivals and grab a meaningful market share in the smartphone market, according to a new report.
The online retail giant is said to be working on a smartphone that will cost less than $250, which is significantly cheaper than the iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S4.
If Amazon can successfully lure customers away from Apple's and Samsung's technology, those companies could be forced to reduce their prices to compete.
According to a new report, Amazon is planning to enter the smartphone market with a device that costs less than $250. The online retail giant is reportedly working on a phone that will undercut Apple's iPhone 5 (left) and Samsung's Galaxy S4 (right), which both cost more than $600
According to a new research note from Topeka Capital Markets analyst Brian White, Amazon is working on a low-cost smartphone that will sell for between $200 and $250.
This is significantly cheaper than Apple's flagship iPhone 5, which starts at $649 without a contract, and Samsung's top-of-the-line Galaxy S4, which sells for $650 without a contract.
Mr White believes that if Amazon is successful in luring customers away from the iPhone and Galaxy S4, Apple and Samsung may be forced to reduce the price of their devices to compete.
'If Amazon is successful in entering the smartphone market, we believe it could have a meaningful impact on the industry,' Mr White wrote in a research note obtained by AllThingsD.
'This is because Amazon has the ability to undercut the competition on price, which could lead to a race to the bottom in terms of pricing.'
Mr White estimates that Amazon could sell as many as 20 million smartphones in 2014, which would make it the third-largest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung and Apple.
He also believes that Amazon could sell up to 50 million phones in 2015, which would put it in second place behind Samsung.
However, Mr White cautioned that Amazon's entry into the smartphone market is not a sure thing, and that the company could face significant challenges.
For example, Amazon would need to find a way to differentiate its phones from the competition, and it would also need to figure out how to make money from the devices.
Despite these challenges, Mr White believes that Amazon is well-positioned to succeed in the smartphone market.
The company already has a strong brand and a large customer base, and it has a proven track record of success in other areas such as e-commerce and cloud computing.
If Amazon is able to successfully enter the smartphone market, it could have a significant impact on the industry.
Apple and Samsung are currently the two largest smartphone makers in the world, but if Amazon is able to undercut them on price, it could force them to reduce their prices in order to compete.
This could lead to a decline in profits for both companies, and it could also make it more difficult for them to invest in new products and technologies.
In addition, Amazon's entrance into the smartphone market could also have a negative impact on other smartphone makers, such as HTC and LG.
These companies are already struggling to compete with Apple and Samsung, and they may find it even more difficult to do so if Amazon enters the market.
Overall, Amazon's plans to launch a low-cost smartphone represent a significant threat to the smartphone industry.
If the company is successful, it could shake up the market and force Apple and Samsung to change their strategies.
However, if Amazon is unable to successfully enter the market, it could simply fade into obscurity.

Amazon is also said to be in talks with wireless carriers AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile to sell the device.
The company is said to have been working on the project for more than a year.
The move would be a major shift for Amazon, which has traditionally focused on selling books, music and movies online.
It would also be a major challenge for Apple and Samsung, which have dominated the smartphone market in recent years.
Apple's iPhone is the world's most popular smartphone, while Samsung's Galaxy S4 is the best-selling Android device.
Both companies are expected to launch new smartphones later this year.
Amazon has not commented on the report.
If the company does launch a smartphone, it would be its first foray into the mobile phone market.
Amazon already sells a range of tablets and e-readers, as well as its Kindle e-book reader.
In 2011, the company launched its first smartphone, the Kindle Fire, which was followed by the Kindle Fire HD in 2012.
The Kindle Fire HDX was launched in 2013.
Amazon's move into the smartphone market could be a major boost for the company, which has struggled to compete with Apple and Samsung in the tablet and e-reader markets.
Apple and Samsung have dominated the tablet market, with Apple's iPad accounting for more than half of all tablet sales in the first quarter of 2013, according to research firm IDC.
Samsung's Galaxy Note 10.1 was the second-best-selling tablet in the same period, while Amazon's Kindle Fire HD was the third-best selling tablet.
Apple is expected to launch its next-generation iPad later this year, while Samsung is expected to unveil its Galaxy Note 3 later this month.
Both devices are expected to be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 processor.
The Wall Street Journal report said that Amazon's smartphone would be based on the Android operating system.
It is not clear whether the device would run on Google's Android or Amazon's own Fire OS.
The report said that the device would have a 4.7-inch display, a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera.
The device would also be powered by a quad-core processor, the report added.

It would also be a major challenge for Apple and Samsung, which have dominated the smartphone market in recent years.
Apple's iPhone is the world's most popular smartphone, while Samsung's Galaxy S4 is the best-selling Android device.
Both companies are expected to launch new smartphones later this year.
Amazon has not commented on the report.
If the company does launch a smartphone, it would be its first foray into the mobile phone market.
Amazon already sells a range of tablets and e-readers, as well as its Kindle e-book reader.
In 2011, the company launched its first smartphone, the Kindle Fire, which was followed by the Kindle Fire HD in 2012.
The Kindle Fire HDX was launched in 2013.
Amazon's move into the smartphone market could be a major boost for the company, which has struggled to compete with Apple and Samsung in the tablet and e-reader markets.
Apple and Samsung have dominated the tablet market, with Apple's iPad accounting for more than half of all tablet sales in the first quarter of 2013, according to research firm IDC.
Samsung's Galaxy Note 10.1 was the second-best-selling tablet in the same period, while Amazon's Kindle Fire HD was the third-best selling tablet.
Apple is expected to launch its next-generation iPad later this year, while Samsung is expected to unveil its Galaxy Note 3 later this month.
Both devices are expected to be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800 processor.
The Wall Street Journal report said that Amazon's smartphone would be based on the Android operating system.
It is not clear whether the device would run on Google's Android or Amazon's own Fire OS.
The report said that the device would have a 4.7-inch display, a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera.
The device would also be powered by a quad-core processor, the report added.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","(729, 28)","(503, 28)"

(CNN) -- A pregnant bartender says she is fighting to keep her job at a
","(CNN) -- A pregnant bartender says she is fighting to keep her job at a gentlemen's club in New York. Jennifer Paviglianiti, of Centereach, N.Y., claims her employer, Café Royale, discriminated against her because of her pregnancy. She filed a claim with the EEOC earlier this month. Paviglianiti says she feared how her boss would react to her pregnancy and wanted to wait a few months to tell him. However, John Doxey found out before she could tell him, and that's when Paviglianiti claims her job became threatened. Up until she became pregnant, the 29-year-old says she had been one of the club's most popular bartenders. Read the complaint . She says she ""bonused 9 times"" since August and it was only toward the end of her pregnancy that she asked for different hours. Due to the tough economy, Paviglianiti says she needed this specific bartending job and feared she'd soon be out of work. To protect herself, she decided to secretly record her boss on tape. On those recordings Doxey can be heard saying, ""Customers don't wanna come in and see a pregnant woman behind the bar!"" These recordings were also submitted in her EEOC discrimination claim. In other recordings, Doxey is heard suggesting that Paviglianiti's appearance is hurting business. ""Maybe they don't go there because the bartender is pregnant and doesn't look sexy."" Workplace attorney Robin Bond said it's within Doxey's right to do this if employees were informed that they had to maintain a specific ""sexy look"" to qualify for the job. In this case, that means Paviglianiti would have had to be hired as a ""model and a bartender"" and get a written agreement to this -- as is done in the casino industry, Bond said on HLN Prime News with Mike Galanos. When asked by Galanos if she signed any paperwork of that sort, Paviglianiti said, ""not at all ... nothing."" Paviglianiti was taken off the bartending schedule for a few weeks, during which she hired an attorney. She later returned to the club as a cashier but claims she made much less than she did as a bartender. However, Doxey's attorney says this proves she was never fired and her job duties were only adjusted to accommodate her pregnancy. ""My client declines to comment on pending legal action except to say it considers that Ms. Paviglianiti allegations are without merit,"" attorney Robert F. Milman said in a statement. ""Ms. Paviglianiti was not terminated from her employment, she presently is on maternity leave and she has the right to return to work upon the conclusion of her leave."" Paviglianiti is due to have a baby girl this week.","(515, 24)","A former employee of a popular restaurant chain has filed a complaint against her former boss, alleging that she was unfairly demoted and had her hours reduced because of her pregnancy. Jennifer Paviglianiti, aged 29, worked as a bartender at a location of the restaurant chain in Tennessee. However, shortly after she informed her boss that she was pregnant, she says that she was demoted to a cashier position and had her hours reduced significantly. As a result of this, Paviglianiti claims that she is now earning substantially less than she was prior to her pregnancy. In her complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), she alleges that her demotion and reduction in hours were discriminatory and violated federal laws that protect pregnant employees. In a recording obtained by local media, Paviglianiti's boss can be heard making disparaging comments about her pregnancy. ""Maybe [customers] don't go there because the bartender is pregnant,"" he said. The recording appears to corroborate Paviglianiti's claims that her pregnancy played a role in her demotion. However, the boss's attorney has defended his client's actions, stating that Paviglianiti's job duties were adjusted to accommodate her pregnancy. The attorney has also denied that her demotion was motivated by discrimination. Pregnancy discrimination is a form of sex discrimination that is prohibited under federal law. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 requires employers to treat pregnant employees the same as other employees with similar job duties and qualifications. This includes providing the same level of pay, benefits, and job security. According to the EEOC, pregnancy discrimination complaints have been on the rise in recent years. In 2019, the agency received 2,720 complaints alleging pregnancy discrimination, an increase of 3.5% from the previous year. Pregnant employees who believe they have been subjected to discrimination or retaliation have the right to file a complaint with the EEOC. The agency can investigate the complaint and, if it determines that there has been a violation of federal law, it can take legal action against the employer. In the case of Jennifer Paviglianiti, the outcome of her complaint has yet to be decided. However, her case highlights the ongoing struggle for pregnant employees to receive fair treatment in the workplace.","(419, 19)","(CNN) -- A pregnant bartender says she is fighting to keep her job at a
New York City bar after her boss cut her hours and put her on the
cash register because of her pregnancy.
Jennifer Paviglianiti filed a complaint with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission last month, saying she was demoted from her
bartending job at the Parkside Lounge in New York City's East Village
because of her pregnancy.
Paviglianiti, who is 29 weeks pregnant, told CNN that she has worked
at the bar for more than two years. She said that when she became
pregnant, her hours were cut from 40 hours a week to 20 hours a week,
and she was put on the cash register instead of behind the bar.
She said her boss told her, ""Maybe (customers) don't go there
because the bartender is pregnant."" Paviglianiti said her boss also
told her, ""I don't know if I want to have a pregnant bartender.""
Paviglianiti said she had no choice but to file a complaint with the
EEOC because she felt she was being discriminated against because of
her pregnancy.
""I didn't want to do this,"" she said. ""I wanted to work it out with
my boss, but she wouldn't talk to me about it.""
The Parkside Lounge did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
But in a statement to the New York Daily News, the bar's attorney
said that Paviglianiti's job duties were changed to accommodate her
pregnancy.
""Ms. Paviglianiti was never 'demoted' from her position as a
bartender,"" the statement said. ""Rather, her job duties were
adjusted to accommodate her pregnancy, and she continued to perform
those duties until she voluntarily resigned from her position.""
The EEOC declined to comment on the specifics of the case, but
spokeswoman Christine Nazer said the agency is committed to
protecting the rights of pregnant women in the workplace.
""The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 amended Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit sex discrimination on the basis
of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions,"" Nazer said
in an email to CNN. ""The law requires that employers treat women
affected by pregnancy or related conditions in the same manner as
other applicants or employees who are similar in their ability or
inability to work.""
Nazer said the EEOC enforces all of its statutes through voluntary
complaints filed by individuals who believe they have been
discriminated against. The agency does not comment on individual
complaints, she said.
According to the National Partnership for Women & Families, a
nonprofit organization that works to improve the lives of women and
their families, one in four women of childbearing age in the United
States is pregnant at any given time.
The organization says that pregnant women and new mothers often face
discrimination in the workplace, including being passed over for
promotions, being fired or laid off, or being forced to take
maternity leave before they are ready.
The group says that women who are pregnant or have recently given
birth are protected by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which
prohibits employers from discriminating against them because of their
pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions.
The act also requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for
pregnant workers, such as allowing them to take breaks to use the
bathroom or drink water, or providing them with a chair or stool to
sit on if they are unable to stand for long periods of time.
In addition, the act requires employers to provide pregnant workers
with the same benefits and privileges as other employees who are
similar in their ability or inability to work.
Despite these protections, many pregnant women continue to face
workplace discrimination. According to a survey by the National
Women's Law Center, a nonprofit organization that works to advance
the status of women and girls in the United States, nearly half of
pregnant women surveyed said they had experienced some form of
discrimination at work because of their pregnancy.
The survey found that pregnant women were more likely to be passed
over for promotions, denied raises or bonuses, or fired or laid off
than non-pregnant women. Pregnant women were also more likely to be
forced to take maternity leave before they were ready, or to be
required to return to work before they were physically able to do so.
The National Women's Law Center says that workplace discrimination
against pregnant women is a serious problem that needs to be
addressed. The organization is calling on Congress to pass the
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which would require employers to
provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers, such as
allowing them to take breaks or use the bathroom, or providing them
with chairs or stools to sit on.

True or false? Andrea Rossi, pictured, says he has built a machine achieving 'cold fusion'
","True or false? Andrea Rossi, pictured, says he has built a machine achieving 'cold fusion'  but scientists question if it is possible . An Italian physicist claims he has managed to achieve 'cold fusion' - a procedure that could solve the world's energy crisis by creating huge amounts of safe nuclear energy without dangerous radiation. Andrea Rossi says his new machine fuses nickel and hydrogen at room temperature creating almost unlimited energy. But there is one problem - many scientists claim it defies the very laws of physics. Several high-profile demonstrations of 'cold fusion' have been proven to be hoaxes in the past - and no one can adequately explain how or why it might work. The United States Department of Energy the U.S. Patent Office say the process is impossible because physics rules out the possibility of room-temperature nuclear fusion. But Rossi's E-Cat machine can allegedly do it, and he says he proved it worked during tests at the University of Bologna last month. 'With low energy, it's possible to give a heater a certain amount of energy and to get from the same heater a superior amount of energy,' he said. 'The heat is initiated by electrical resistance. The reactors then produce another 479kWh of energy for another three to four hours without needing that initial electrical input -- the low-level nuclear reaction continues on its own. Machine: Professor Rossi's E-Cat was tested last month and produced huge amounts of non-radioactive energy, he says . Key: Rossi says he has produced a pattern of triple track atoms, pictured, which is at the heart of the cold fusion theory . 'The test we made by the customer was to see if the process was working properly, and to control whether the energy was in an amount superior to the amount supplied to the system. 'We have nothing to say, just to make plans that work properly and let those facts win against the scepticism.' The idea of cold fusion was put forward by in the 1920s by Austrian scientists Friedrich Paneth and Kurt Peters. But despite several people saying they have done it, it has been dismissed by most physicists. An atom is a nucleus of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting around . Scientists say that Rossi's claims must be taken from his lab and analysed before he can claim he has done it. Energy consultant Jonathan Koomey said '[The E-Cat experiment] should be treated as a hoax until independent scientists are able to replicate these results,' But Sterling Allan, CEO of the alternative energy news agency Pure Energy Systems, told FoxNews.com he attended Rossi’s demonstration and the E-Cat is self sustaining. 'What Rossi demonstrated was 470 kilowatts of continuous output in self-sustain mode -- meaning the output was enough to keep the thing running on its own,' he said.","(524, 21)","Controversy has arisen in the scientific community after Andrea Rossi, an Italian physicist, claimed that he has found a way to fuse nickel and hydrogen at room temperature, potentially creating an unlimited source of energy. Rossi, who has been working on this technology for the past decade, asserts that his invention could provide a feasible solution to the world’s increasing energy demands. The concept of fusion energy is not new, and scientists have long been exploring the potential of fusion as a source of renewable energy. In traditional nuclear fusion, atoms are fused at very high temperatures and pressures, typically above 100 million degrees Celsius. However, Rossi's method is radically different, claiming to achieve fusion at a much lower temperature, purportedly at or near room temperature. The implications of Rossi’s claims are significant, as they would provide an alternative to traditional fossil fuels, which have been causing harm to the environment. But the scientific community has been cautious about accepting Rossi's claims. Many scientists reject Rossi's assertions, stating that they defy the very laws of physics and that there is no possible way to achieve nuclear fusion at room temperature. Rossi, on the other hand, has denied these claims and insists that his method, now called the “E-Cat SK,” is not only feasible but also reliable. Rossi’s E-Cat SK device has already been tested by several independent companies, including the national laboratory of the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA). According to Rossi, these tests have demonstrated the validity and feasibility of his technology. But skepticism persists. Some skeptics claim that Rossi's methodology is based on fraud and that his invention is nothing more than a scam. Others argue that the experiments were not conducted under appropriate settings and lack the necessary scientific rigor. Despite these criticisms, Rossi remains optimistic about the potential of his invention, and he continues to work on refining and improving the technology. Furthermore, Italian entrepreneur and inventor Sergio Della Sala has joined forces with Rossi, bringing his own knowledge and expertise to the project. The potential benefits of Rossi's invention are immense, and if his claims are true, the energy industry, as we know it, could be transformed. It could provide almost limitless energy and mark a new era in energy production, which is precisely what the world needs. In conclusion, Rossi's claims have generated a significant amount of interest in the scientific community, offering the tantalizing prospect of limitless, clean energy. However, given the controversial nature of these claims, further tests will undoubtedly be required before the E-Cat SK can be considered a game-changer in the energy industry. Until then, scientists will continue to study, examine and hypothesize about Rossi's findings.","(528, 21)","True or false? Andrea Rossi, pictured, says he has built a machine achieving 'cold fusion'
Andrea Rossi, an Italian inventor, claims to have built a machine that can create almost unlimited energy by fusing nickel and hydrogen atoms at room temperature.
Many scientists are sceptical about his claims, saying they defy the laws of physics. However, Mr Rossi says he has already sold more than 100 of the machines to customers around the world.
Mr Rossi's device is called the E-Cat, which stands for Energy Catalyser. He says it works by using a small amount of nickel powder and hydrogen gas to produce large amounts of energy.
The process is known as cold fusion because it takes place at room temperature, rather than the high temperatures usually required for nuclear reactions.
Mr Rossi says the E-Cat can produce up to 10,000 times more energy than it consumes, making it a potentially limitless source of power.
However, many scientists are highly sceptical of Mr Rossi's claims. They say that cold fusion is impossible because it would violate the laws of physics.
One of the main objections is that cold fusion would violate the law of conservation of energy. This law states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but can only be converted from one form to another.
If cold fusion were possible, it would mean that energy could be created out of nothing, which would violate this law.
Another objection is that there is no known mechanism by which cold fusion could occur. Nuclear reactions typically require high temperatures and pressures, which are not present in Mr Rossi's device.
Some scientists have tried to replicate Mr Rossi's results, but have been unable to do so. This has led many to conclude that his claims are simply not true.
Despite the scepticism, Mr Rossi remains confident in his invention. He says he has already received orders for more than 100 E-Cats from customers around the world, who are willing to pay up to $1 million each for the machines.
Mr Rossi says he plans to use the profits from selling the E-Cats to fund further research into cold fusion. He hopes that one day, his invention will help to solve the world's energy crisis.
However, until then, many scientists remain unconvinced by his claims. They believe that cold fusion is simply not possible, and that Mr Rossi's device is nothing more than a hoax.
Only time will tell whether Mr Rossi's claims are true or false. In the meantime, his invention continues to generate controversy and debate among scientists and the general public alike.

Congratulations! Your article is well-written and meets all of the requirements. It is clear, concise, and easy to follow. You have incorporated all of the key highlights into your article, and you have done so in a way that is both informative and engaging. Your article is also well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Overall, I am very impressed with your work. Keep up the good work!","(582, 32)","True or false? Andrea Rossi, pictured, says he has built a machine achieving 'cold fusion'
False. Andrea Rossi has not built a machine that achieves cold fusion. He has built an E-Cat, a device that uses nuclear reactions to generate heat. The E-Cat has not been proven to work, and there is no evidence to suggest that it will work in the future.
What is cold fusion?
Cold fusion is a type of nuclear fusion that occurs at room temperature. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers the sun and other stars. In nuclear fusion, atoms are forced together to form a new, heavier atom. This releases a huge amount of energy, which can be used to generate electricity.
Andrea Rossi claims that his E-Cat can achieve nuclear fusion at room temperature, but there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Nuclear fusion requires extremely high temperatures, so it is unlikely that the E-Cat will be able to achieve this.
Is cold fusion possible?
It is possible that cold fusion could be achieved in the future, but it is not possible at the moment. Scientists have been trying to achieve cold fusion for many years, but they have not been able to do so. There are a number of reasons why cold fusion is difficult to achieve. One reason is that it is very difficult to control the conditions under which nuclear fusion takes place. Another reason is that nuclear fusion requires very high temperatures, which are difficult to achieve in a laboratory setting.
Why is cold fusion controversial?
There is a lot of debate about whether or not cold fusion is possible. Some scientists believe that it is possible, while others think that it is impossible. The debate has been going on for a long time, and it is not likely to be resolved any time soon.
What are the benefits of cold fusion if it is achieved?
If cold fusion is achieved, it could have a number of benefits. One benefit is that it could provide a new source of energy that is clean and renewable. It could also be used to produce hydrogen, which could be used as a fuel for cars and other vehicles. Finally, it could be used to power nuclear reactors, which could help to reduce the need for fossil fuels.","(434, 27)","True or false?

(CNN) -- Tuesday's deadly suicide attack targeting Afghan Shia just didn't fit the pattern of
","(CNN) -- Tuesday's deadly suicide attack targeting Afghan Shia just didn't fit the pattern of what had come before in this troubled country. The police formed the usual cordon at the attack site -- this time a shrine in Kabul. Sirens pierced the odd moment of eerie silence, but the police chief's face was contorted with fury and confusion, like he'd seen something new and troubling -- even after decades of conflict here. Yes, the insurgency has specialized in hitting targets right in the city center, often meters away from key institutions. Yes, they are aimed for effect. But mass casualty attacks like we used to see in 2009 are rare these days. The insurgents prefer to hit strategic targets -- unless their roadside bombs are maiming civilians elsewhere. And no, the Shia simply weren't targets before. Sectarianism was seldom an issue here: Afghanistan has lacked the Sunni-Shia divide in Iraq that helped to keep Saddam in power but made his fall so bloody. It has been spared the brand of Sunni extremism in Pakistan, where ruthless attacks on Shia are a shocking part of the fabric. The question of who did it was quickly answered but unsatisfactorily. The interior ministry here points its finger at the Taliban, despite an effusive denial from spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid. It's arguable that an offshoot of the Lashkar-e-Janghvi movement, which reportedly rang in a claim from Pakistan, is capable of mounting a sophisticated, targeted and vicious attack in the very heart of Kabul without some assistance. If they are responsible, it does require some explanation as to how a small, rogue group of extremists -- which has links to al Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban -- could suddenly develop the capacity to penetrate the capital of a neighboring state. And are Pakistani extremists really operating freely inside Afghanistan now? Whether the culprits turn out to be the Pakistan-based Haqqani network -- the group blamed for recent high-profile and sophisticated attacks in the capital -- the Lashkar-e-Janghvi al Almi, or another complex part of Afghanistan's insurgency, fractured and complicated after 10 years, many Afghans place the blame at one source: Pakistan. That's the ""address"" that Kabul thinks the Taliban now resides under. That's who they blame for most of the ills here, despite simultaneously hoping they will come to the negotiating table and help. But we should not rush to attribute blame for one reason: The advent of Pakistani extremists trying to foment sectarian violence in Afghanistan at this late stage in the war is a prospect too terrifying to behold.","(478, 19)","In a country already ravaged by decades of violence and unrest, Afghanistan was once again rocked by a deadly suicide attack on Tuesday. The explosion, which occurred outside a military academy in the capital city of Kabul, left at least six people dead and over a dozen others injured.  What made this attack particularly unusual was that it did not fit the pattern of previous attacks that have plagued the country in recent years. While mass casualty attacks have been a frequent occurrence in Afghanistan, insurgents have largely shifted their tactics to focus on hitting strategic targets such as military convoys and government buildings.  Despite the change in tactics, the Afghan interior ministry has pointed the finger at the usual suspect: the Taliban. The insurgent group, which is currently negotiating with the Afghan government in an effort to end the conflict, has swiftly denied any involvement in the attack.  Many Afghans, however, are placing the blame on a different source entirely: Pakistan. The relationship between Afghanistan and its eastern neighbor has long been fraught, with each accusing the other of harboring militants and supporting cross-border attacks.  Afghanistan has long accused Pakistan of providing safe haven for Taliban fighters, allowing them to regroup and launch attacks across the border. In recent years, the two countries have engaged in a series of peace talks and negotiations, but progress has been slow, and mistrust runs deep on both sides.  The latest attack has only heightened tensions between the two countries, with Afghan officials openly accusing Pakistan of being behind the suicide bombing. Pakistan, for its part, has denied any involvement in the attack and has called for greater cooperation between the two nations in the fight against terrorism.  Despite the finger-pointing and accusations, the reality on the ground in Afghanistan remains grim. The country continues to be plagued by violence and insecurity, with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict. Many Afghans remain skeptical that the peace talks with the Taliban will lead to any real change, and the latest attack only underscores the challenges that lie ahead.  As the Afghan government and its international partners struggle to find a way forward, the people of Afghanistan continue to suffer the grim toll of a seemingly endless conflict. With no easy solutions in sight, the country remains trapped in a cycle of violence and instability that shows no signs of abating anytime soon.  In the wake of Tuesday's attack, the question on everyone's mind is the same: when will the violence end, and what will it take to finally bring peace to Afghanistan? Only time will tell, but what is clear is that the road ahead will be a long and difficult one, with many challenges and obstacles to overcome.","(506, 19)","(CNN) -- Tuesday's deadly suicide attack targeting Afghan Shia just didn't fit the pattern of

There is always a group of children waiting to hand the Queen the customary posy
","There is always a group of children waiting to hand the Queen the customary posy of flowers when she walks out of morning service. But yesterday Prince Philip was also given his own treat when the couple emerged from a church in West Newton, Norfolk. As Her Majesty smiled as she looked on, the Duke of Edinburgh appeared equally delighted to receive a bag of sweets from a young well-wisher outside the church in the heart of the Sandringham Estate. Sweet treat: Prince Philip was given a bag of Morrisons chocolate éclairs by a young girl, left, after attending a church service in West Newton, Norfolk . Inedible gifts: As has become tradition, the Queen accepted bouquets of flowers from waiting children . The sweets - an 89p bag of own-brand chocolate éclairs from Morrisons - were later spotted on the Prince's lap as he was driven away. Parents crowded round with camera phones to capture the moment as their sons and daughters bravely stepped forward to meet the monarch - while some hung shyly back. The bouquets are often tactfully placed in a separate car by one of the Queen's security team. But the éclairs seemed to find a special place in the Prince's heart, and was spotted still on his lap as the Royal car pulled away. The Royal pair had attended a service at the Church of St Peter and Paul, which is on the Sandringham estate. Happy and glorious: The Queen beamed as excited parents and children crowded round in the sunshine . Spectators: During the service, the Queen and Prince saw a Biblical play performed by Sunday school children . According to local media, the Queen and Philip had just enjoyed a performance of a Biblical play - Whither Thou Go'est - performed by children at the church's Sunday School. The monarch often accepts flowers after morning service when she is staying at Sandringham, although in recent weeks the practice has become a little haphazard. Last week the Queen dashed straight to her waiting car because of heavy rain, following successive Sundays in which she has accepted bouquets of flowers. She had refused to accept flowers from children for two Sundays over Christmas and New Year, reportedly because she had to collect so many on Christmas Day she was late for lunch.","(420, 16)","Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, made a visit to West Newton, Norfolk on Sunday where they attended a church service. The Queen was met by a group of children who lined the entrance of the church and were eager to give her the traditional gift of bouquets of flowers. However, it was the Duke of Edinburgh who ended up receiving a special treat during their visit. A young girl, in a gesture of kindness, presented the Duke with a pack of sweets from a brand which carries her name. The Duke of Edinburgh was visibly pleased with his unexpected gift and even showed his appreciation by opening the packet and trying one of the sweets. The couple's visit to the church in West Newton, which is about 100 miles northeast of London, was a part of their stay at Sandringham Estate. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh often spend their time at Sandringham Estate in Norfolk during the Christmas holidays. The royal couple's visit to the church was not just another regular visit, as it was said to be a special occasion in the local community. Church officials had even arranged additional seating for those who had come to catch a glimpse of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh has been married for over 70 years and have a long history of supporting the Church of England. The Royal Family is known to frequently attend church services and has been attending the Church of England since its establishment. The Queen was dressed in a light green outfit and a matching hat, while the Duke of Edinburgh wore a navy blue suit with a purple tie. The couple, both in their nineties, appeared to be in good spirits during the visit and seemed to enjoy the warm welcome they received from the local community. As the visit came to an end, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were seen leaving the church, waving at the gathered crowd as they made their way towards their car. For the young girl who gave the Duke of Edinburgh the packet of sweets from her own brand, it will surely be a moment she won't forget anytime soon.","(411, 15)","There is always a group of children waiting to hand the Queen the customary posy

delighted to receive the gift. He thanked the young girl and took the bag of
sweets with him as he made his way into the church.

Ireland.
The Queen’s reign has been marked by a number of significant events, including
the end of the Second World War, the decolonization of the British Empire, and
the establishment of the European Union. The Queen has also played a key role in
the development of the Commonwealth, which now includes 54 member states.

the throne in 1952. She is also the oldest reigning monarch in the world, having
celebrated her 90th birthday in 2016.
Despite her advanced age, the Queen continues to carry out a busy schedule of
engagements, both in the UK and abroad. She is widely respected for her
dedication to her duties and her commitment to the people of the UK and the
Commonwealth.
The Queen is also known for her sense of humor and her ability to put people at
ease. She is often seen laughing and joking with members of the public, and she
has a reputation for being down-to-earth and approachable.
The Queen is a symbol of stability and continuity in a world that is often
characterized by change and uncertainty. She is a reminder of the values and
traditions that have shaped the UK and the Commonwealth over the centuries, and

","(CNN)Protesters gathered at Kiev's Independence Square Sunday to march for peace, while fighting in Ukraine's east claimed more victims. Ukraine's President and prime minister were among those who attended the rally that had as its slogan ""I am Volnovakha,"" in memory of the 13 passengers who died near the city of Volnovakha after their bus was hit by artillery shelling on January 13. ""We will remember every Ukrainian hero who gave (life) for the sake of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" said Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. ""We will not give up a single meter of our land."" Meanwhile, fighting in the east continued. Government forces and pro-Russia rebels have been battling for control of eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions since April, after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region the previous month. The Ukrainian army was able to regain full control of the Donetsk airport, military spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko said Sunday. Over the last 24 hours, four Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 32 were wounded, the spokesman said. A 7-year-old boy and a 16-year-old were killed when a missile struck a house in the town of Vuhlehirsk, in Donetsk, said Donetsk's regional police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin on his Facebook page. A young girl was seriously injured. A ceasefire deal was reached on September 5 in Minsk, Belarus, following talks between representatives of Ukraine, Russia and rebel leaders. A subsequent agreement on September 19 set out more measures, but there has been little sign of progress as all sides blame each other for the bloodshed. The United Nations issued a statement Sunday, calling on all parties to exercise restraint. ""The Secretary-General is alarmed by the severe escalation of fighting for control of Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine, which has already caused numerous casualties and threatened to completely unravel a hard-won September 2014 cease-fire,"" it read. The statement continued: The Secretary-General stresses that further deterioration of a situation that has led to heavy loss of life and civilian suffering must be avoided at all costs. The United Nations stands ready to support all efforts toward de-escalation and the resumption of a genuine peace process to restore Ukraine's stability and territorial integrity."" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","(428, 17)","After a fierce battle that has been lasting since April, the Ukrainian army has finally regained full control of the Donetsk airport. According to a spokesman of the military, the government forces have pushed out all the pro-Russia rebels that have been occupying the airport complex. The airport complex has been one of the major flashpoints in the ongoing conflict between the Ukrainian government and the pro-Russian separatists in the eastern region of Donetsk. The pro-Russian rebels have controlled the airport since they first seized it in 2014, but the Ukrainian army has been making concerted efforts to take back the airport for several months. The battle for the airport has been one of the bloodiest engagements in the entire conflict. The fighting has been intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. However, the government troops have gradually gained ground in the airport complex in recent weeks, and have now finally managed to get the upper hand and regain full control of the airport. The recapture of the airport is a significant victory for the Ukrainian government, as it restores control of a strategically important location that was once a major transport hub. The airport was a key asset for pro-Russian separatists, as it provided them with a vital supply line for weapons, ammunition, and troops. The Ukrainian government has said that it will now use the airport as a base for launching further operations against the rebels in eastern Ukraine. The army is reportedly preparing to launch a major offensive against separatist-held territory in the coming weeks. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has already claimed the lives of more than 13,000 people and displaced over 1.6 million since it first erupted in 2014. The fighting has intensified in recent months, with both sides blaming each other for the escalating violence. However, the recapture of the Donetsk airport is expected to give a boost to the Ukrainian army in their ongoing efforts to defeat the pro-Russian rebels and bring peace to the region. The Ukrainian government has said that it remains committed to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict, but will not hesitate to use force if necessary to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The international community has called on both sides to end the violence and resume peace talks, but with so much bloodshed on both sides, it remains to be seen whether a lasting peace agreement can be reached anytime soon.","(436, 16)","(CNN)Protesters gathered at Kiev's Independence Square Sunday to march for peace, while fighting in Ukraine's

(CNN) -- Mobile users who have gotten used to chatting with their friends via Facebook
","(CNN) -- Mobile users who have gotten used to chatting with their friends via Facebook will soon have to make sure they've downloaded the social-media giant's app designed specifically for that. Facebook has begun notifying mobile users that they'll no longer be able to text via its core app. Instead, they'll need to download Messenger, the dedicated texting app Facebook rolled out in 2011. The company started notifying some users last week. The update will roll out first to Android and iOS users in a handful of European countries, according to a Facebook spokeswoman. ""Messenger is a much faster and better experience and we've found that people get replies 20% faster on Messenger than on Facebook,"" the spokeswoman said in an e-mail. ""Taking messages out of the Facebook app also lets us focus on making Messenger even better for everyone rather than working on two separate Facebook messaging experiences."" In November, after Facebook launched Messenger 3.0, the company discontinued messaging in the core Facebook app for people who already had Messenger. The good news for people still using just the Facebook app is that they'll be able to message friends in much the same way they do now. Once both apps are installed, tapping the ""message"" icon on the Facebook app will simply send the user to Messenger. They'll be able to return via a ""return to Facebook"" icon. Facebook and mobile messaging have been linked in many folks' minds since last month, when the company shelled out a staggering $19 billion for WhatsApp, a texting app far more popular overseas than it is in the United States. Despite speculation, Facebook said at the time that it has no plans to merge WhatsApp, which lets users send unlimited messages for no more than 99 cents a year, with Messenger. Both are part of a maturing set of apps that are marginalizing cellular plans that charge for texting. Unlimited texting is already standard with many mobile plans in the U.S., but not so much in places like India, Africa and South America, where WhatsApp is most popular.","(396, 15)","Facebook has made the decision to require users to utilize its separate texting app, Messenger, for sending messages. The social media giant started notifying users of the change last week, and the new requirement is expected to take effect in the coming months. This news may come as a shock to some users who have become accustomed to sending messages from within their Facebook app. If you don't already have the Messenger app downloaded, you will need to do so in order to send messages going forward. Previously, users could perform all messaging functions within the Facebook app, but this will no longer be the case. If you already have both apps, then you will not experience any changes. According to Facebook, the new requirement is a part of an effort to simplify and streamline messaging for users. Messenger is currently packed with features that are not available within the traditional Facebook app, and the company is hoping that requiring its use will help users discover the benefits of the platform. Some users have expressed concerns about privacy, as Messenger requests access to information such as the camera, microphone, and contacts on a user's smartphone. However, Facebook has made assurances that the app is secure and that users' information is protected. The company has also pointed out that most messaging apps require similar access. Many users have already made the switch to Messenger and are enjoying the app's features. The platform offers real-time chat, voice and video calls, games, and other interactive features. Additionally, users can easily share photos, videos, and other content with each other on the app. It remains to be seen how users will react to this change, but it seems likely that the vast majority will eventually make the switch to Messenger. Facebook has made a calculated decision in requiring the use of the app, and it will undoubtedly lead to increased usage and engagement. In conclusion, users of Facebook's messaging platform will soon be required to use the Messenger app for sending messages. This change is part of an effort to streamline messaging and offer users new features and benefits. Although some users may experience privacy concerns, Facebook has stated that the app is secure and protected. If you haven't already done so, it's time to download Messenger and start enjoying its many benefits!","(440, 20)","(CNN) -- Mobile users who have gotten used to chatting with their friends via Facebook

(CNN) -- Bubba Watson secured his first World Golf Championship title and first win outside
","(CNN) -- Bubba Watson secured his first World Golf Championship title and first win outside of the United States Sunday -- but in typical fashion took his own very individual route to an unlikely victory. The two-time Masters champion held a two-shot lead with three holes to play in the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai before going bogey-double bogey to trail by one playing the 18th at the Sheshan International course. His hopes looked over when his second shot to the par-five found a green side bunker but the 36-year-old American had one more moment of magic left in his locker. He blasted the ball onto the green and then watched as it rolled 25-feet into the cup for an eagle three. That left him tied on 11-under 277 with South African Tim Clark and a playoff followed over the same 18th hole. A pumped up Watson was not to be denied and a 20-foot birdie putt was enough for him to secure his seventh career victory and third of 2014, including the Masters at Augusta. ""For me this is the big one,"" Watson told the European Tour website. ""It's very big because I always wanted to win outside the U.S."" Watson said the his wonder shot on the final hole of regulation play came as a surprise even to him. ""It was such a tough bunker shot you are not really thinking about making it, but I told my caddie it's been a wild day, a wild couple of holes, but if we can make this it changes everything and it went in like a putt."" Overnight leader Graeme McDowell, who had been at the head of affairs since the first day, saw his chances disappear with a final round 73 to end in a tie for third with American Rickie Fowler and Hiroshi Iwata of Japan. All three also had chances on the final hole of at least joining the playoff, but Fowler found the water while McDowell and Iwata could not make the requisite birdie. U.S. Open champion Martin Kaymer was another in the mix, but he found the water on the 18th with his second shot and made a double bogey seven to finish in a tie for sixth on eight under with England's Ian Poulter and Thorbjorn Olesen of Norway. World number one Rory McIlroy did not take part in the tournament while Watson will rise to third in the rankings after his latest victory.","(443, 13)","Bubba Watson secured his first World Golf Championships (WGC) and overseas tournament victory by winning the WGC-HSBC Champions at China's Sheshan International course on Sunday. The win came after a dramatic sudden-death playoff against Tim Clark, which Watson won with a birdie on the first extra hole. The American golfer had been trailing overnight leader Graeme McDowell, but the Irishman suffered a poor back nine that saw him shoot a three-over 75, finishing in a group one shot behind Watson and Clark.  Watson, who had been sitting in a tie for third place going into the final round, shot a final-round 71, finishing with a 11-under 277 total, tying Clark who had posted a three-under 69. Watson expressed his gratitude towards his caddy, who played a major role in his victory.  Speaking to the media, Watson said, ""I hit some bad shots, but my caddie was there to talk me through it, and he kept me focused. I knew that if I put it in play off the tee, I would have a chance to make birdies, and that's exactly what I did. To win a WGC and an overseas event is something special, and I'm grateful to have done it."" Watson's success in China completes an outstanding year for the 36-year-old, who has now won twice on the PGA and European Tours in 2014. He also contributed significantly to Team USA's Ryder Cup victory in September. For Clark, his play-off defeat was a bitter pill to swallow. He had led by two strokes with two holes to play but bogeyed the 17th to give Watson a chance to tie for the lead. Despite the disappointing end, Clark's position will give him confidence for the rest of the season. McDowell, on the other hand, will rue his missed opportunity to win the tournament. The 35-year-old had been in great form throughout the week, but it all fell apart in the final round. He will no doubt be disappointed with his third-place finish, having led for much of the tournament. Nevertheless, it was an exciting tournament with plenty of action going down to the wire. Watson's impressive play in the sudden-death playoff secured the win, and he will now head back to the US with his head held high. His win also marks a good start to the new season ahead of him.  Overall, the tournament will be remembered for Watson's outstanding performance, and his triumph in Shanghai will be talked-about for years to come.","(472, 20)","(CNN) -- Bubba Watson secured his first World Golf Championship title and first win outside

","By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 12:11 EST, 2 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:21 EST, 4 February 2013 . Eric Schmidt has written a book predicting the future of technology . Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, has predicted China will be the world's most 'sophisticated hacker' in his new book predicting the future of technology. His new book 'The Digital Age' co-written by Jared Cohen, who runs Google Ideas, the search giant’s think tank, believe that China, is 'the most sophisticated and prolific hacker of foreign companies'. They also say that the country is the 'the world's most active and enthusiastic filterer of information', highlighting how China strongly censors information from outside, carefully selecting what its population can access. The Wall Street Journal, who reviewed the book, say that the book concentrates on how China's government and state companies are willing to use cyber crime - giving the increasingly powerful state 'an economic and political edge'. The Google pair examine how China's readiness to commit cyber crime is a 'difference in values' from other countries such as America - meaning the country will spy on big businesses compared to other states that crack down on such activity. The duo predict that China will only continue to grow in terms of influence, as their technological firms become more competitive and more advanced. According to the Wall Street Journal, the book predicts how other countries might follow China's lead in terms of hacking, so as to compete in terms of political and economical gain. Chinese authorities and Google have had a fraught relationship since January 2010, when the company said it may shut down Chinese operations due to a 'sophisticated and targeted' cyber attack. Google said at the time that it was no longer willing to censor its Chinese search engine. Rocky: Google and China have had a fraught relationship over the nature of censorship . The company began to redirect search queries from mainland China to its Hong Kong website. In December last year the ruling Communist party announced moves to force internet users to fully identify themselves to service providers, raising fresh concerns about freedom of speech in the country. Tensions over censorship highlight Beijing's complicated relations with global technology companies. The communist government wants to boost incomes by promoting high-tech industry but insists on controlling access to information. Beijing promotes Internet use for education and business and has the world's biggest population of Internet users, with 513 million people online as of December, but tries to block politically sensitive material.

The figure is a nod to pi, an irrational number that has intrigued mathematicians for thousands of years.","(535, 28)","A new book published by a group of cybersecurity experts has claimed that many countries will resort to hacking to compete with China. According to the authors of the book, hacking will give powerful countries a political and economic edge over China. The rise of China as a superpower in recent years has put pressure on other nations to find ways to compete. The country's rapid growth in technological advancements and economic power has made it a formidable competitor on the global stage. The authors of the book argue that many countries are now turning to hacking as a way to level the playing field. Hacking is not a new phenomenon, but its use as a tool of statecraft has become increasingly common. Governments have been accused of using hackers to carry out cyber espionage and cyber attacks on other nations. The authors of the book claim that this trend is set to continue, with countries using hacking to gain an edge over China. One of the key arguments put forward in the book is that hacking is a low-cost, low-risk way for countries to gain an advantage. Unlike traditional forms of espionage or military action, hacking can be carried out without the need for physical presence, making it more difficult to detect and respond to. This makes it an attractive option for countries who want to compete with China but are unwilling or unable to do so using traditional methods. The authors of the book also claim that hacking can be used to influence political outcomes, giving countries a strategic advantage. By gaining access to sensitive information, countries can use it to influence elections or sway public opinion. This can have a significant impact on a country's political and economic future. The book has sparked controversy, with many experts criticizing the authors' claims. Some argue that hacking is illegal and unethical, and that any country caught using it would face severe consequences. Others point out that the use of hacking in international relations is already well-established, with countries like the United States and Russia accused of using it against each other. Despite the controversy, the authors of the book believe that hacking will continue to be used by countries looking to compete with China. They argue that as technology advances, the use of hacking is likely to become even more prevalent, making it an essential tool for countries seeking political and economic power. China has not responded to the claims made in the book, but it is likely that the country is already aware of the threat posed by hacking. The Chinese government has been accused of using hacking as a tool of statecraft in the past, and it is likely that the country is taking steps to protect itself from similar attacks. The book is likely to fuel debate about the role of hacking in international relations. While some may view it as a necessary tool for countries to compete with each other, others will see it as a dangerous and unethical practice that should be discouraged. Either way, the use of hacking is likely to remain a contentious issue for years to come.","(571, 24)","By. Anna Edwards. PUBLISHED:. 12:11 EST, 2 February 2013. |.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Up to 80,000 items at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library are unaccounted
","WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Up to 80,000 items at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library are unaccounted for, probably because of haphazard record-keeping and inventory procedures, officials said Thursday. An audit found ""significant breakdown in internal controls"" at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. An audit completed last month by the National Archives and Records Administration's inspector general looked at the management of presidential artifacts at six presidential libraries. It ""cites particular issues at the Ronald Reagan Library. ... We acknowledge that problems exist in inventory control at the Reagan library,"" said a statement from Allen Weinstein, national archivist. Inspector General Paul Brachfield was more blunt. A ""significant breakdown in internal controls"" was found at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, California, he said in a statement Thursday. The audit results prompted the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation to urge the National Archives -- which is responsible for maintaining the artifacts -- to move quickly to fix the problems. The chairman of the board of trustees has contacted Weinstein ""to express the serious concerns and disappointment on behalf of the Reagan Foundation and Mrs. Reagan,"" the foundation said. Library officials told auditors that ""the collection contained approximately 100,000 items, yet the library systems only had information to locate and account for approximately 20,000 items,"" Brachfield said. ""This does not automatically mean the approximately 80,000 remaining items are missing. The vast majority may very well be safely located within the library's storage facilities. ... Some of these items may be missing or stolen, or none of these items may be missing or stolen."" Control deficiencies at the library created an environment that could potentially have been exploited, Brachfield said. Although Congress has a copy of the audit, it has not yet been made public because of the ongoing investigation into the whereabouts of the items. The count of 100,000 was an estimate taken from the original Reagan White House Gift Unit database, Weinstein said Thursday, but was never meant to be used as a concrete inventory control number. The Reagan library has already begun implementing recommendations from the audit, he said. It has upgraded its management inventory software, is hiring additional trained museum staff, has begun a comprehensive inventory and is addressing storage issues by reshelving artifacts and taking steps to protect artifacts in case of an earthquake. ""Like all of the presidential libraries, the Reagan library stores their gifts in a locked vault, which is protected by a security camera,"" Weinstein said. The audit examined management of artifacts at the Reagan library; the Franklin D. Roosevelt library; the John F. Kennedy library; the Gerald R. Ford library; the George Bush library; and the William J. Clinton library, Weinstein said. ""Early collections of artifacts came to presidential libraries with few controls and incomplete information relating to the collections,"" he said. E-mail to a friend .","(539, 23)","In a startling revelation, a recent report by the inspector general has found that out of 100,000 items held by library systems, only about 20,000 are locatable. This has naturally caused widespread concern, as the remaining 80,000 items are unaccounted for. However, the inspector general has stressed that this doesn't necessarily mean the unaccounted-for items are lost. In fact, the report acknowledges that many of these items may be safely located within the library's storage – though without proper tracking, there's no way to be sure. The report has already drawn criticism from some quarters, with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation expressing ""serious concerns"" about the state of library systems. The foundation's representative, Brian Burch, was quick to point out that proper record-keeping is crucial to ensuring the safety and preservation of historical documents. ""It's not enough to simply say that items are 'safely located',"" Burch said. ""Without proper tracking and organization, there's a real risk of losing or damaging irreplaceable historical artifacts."" Burch's concerns are shared by many in the library community, who are well-aware of the challenges of managing large collections. While modern tracking systems and database tools have made it much easier to keep track of items, there are still many older items that simply haven't been cataloged according to modern standards. Furthermore, many libraries struggle with a lack of resources, both in terms of funding and personnel. Without dedicated staff to oversee the management of collections, there's a real risk of items falling through the cracks or getting lost in the shuffle. Despite these challenges, many library systems are taking steps to improve their record-keeping and management practices. Some are turning to digitization as a way of ensuring that even the oldest and most fragile items can be cataloged and tracked. Others are investing in modern tracking and database tools, which can automatically flag missing items and help librarians quickly locate them. Many are also working to streamline their storage systems, in order to make it easier for staff to access and manage collections. Ultimately, the inspector general's report serves as a wake-up call to the library community – a reminder of the crucial importance of proper collection management and preservation. While the challenges are significant, the rewards are even greater – preserving our cultural heritage for future generations to come.","(441, 18)","WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Up to 80,000 items at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library are unaccounted

(CNN) -- It is 1a.m. at the Manila offices of VXi and nearly everyone is
","(CNN) -- It is 1a.m. at the Manila offices of VXi and nearly everyone is on the phone. Hundreds of employees, each wearing a headset, are answering calls from thousands of miles away, providing technical advice and sales services to customers of some of the United States' best-known companies. VXi is at the center of one of the Philippine's greatest economic success stories of the last decade: call centers. Industry experts estimate that the industry here has grown to $11 billion and employs over 600,000 workers. That's even more than in India. ""You'd be hard pressed to find families that don't have one person in their families employed in the call center industry,"" says Eppie Titong, senior site director at VXi's Manila office. While the Philippines has struggled to grow other industries such as manufacturing or tourism, the country has found it is uniquely positioned to excel in the call center business. Thanks to historical ties to the United States, the Philippines has a large, English-speaking population, with an accent that many consider light or easy for the American ear. Most Filipinos are also familiar with American cultural exports, ranging from American Idol to Krispy Kreme donuts. This informal bond, employers say, makes it easier for them to relate to Americans over the telephone. Philippine culture is also known for its hospitality. ""We are friendly,"" says call center supervisor Audison ""Ives"" Tan Dejos. ""We do care. We have the empathy."" On the economic front, the Philippines is an affordable place to do business. An entry-level call center employee can make about $470 a month, which is a very good salary for the Philippines but far less than their counterparts are paid in the U.S. or Europe. The influx of outsourced jobs is a major gift for a country that struggles to put its more than 90 million people to work. The official unemployment rate is around 7% and many people are forced to settle for part-time jobs. Not that the call center industry is going to fix all the country's employment problems. 600,000 is a drop in the bucket compared to the size of the population and these jobs are targeted primarily at those with a college education. ""Who can provide jobs for moderately skilled workers like high school graduates or less educated workers?"" asks Norio Usui, Senior Country Economist at the Asian Development Bank. ""The Philippines has plenty of such workers also."" For Tan Dejos, whose wife also works at VXi, the work is stressful at times but it allows them to comfortably support their three children. He doesn't mind the night shift, he says, and he likes the challenge of being in an emerging industry. Would he want his kids to work at a call center? ""I would,"" he says without hesitation. ""It's really up to them.""","(550, 29)","The Philippines has surpassed India in the number of call center workers, according to industry experts. This is not only a significant milestone for the country's economy, but also for the call center industry as a whole. With an estimated worth of $11 billion, the business has become a significant contributor to the Philippine economy. One of the reasons why the Philippines has become a popular destination for call center outsourcing is the soft accent and historical ties to the United States. American companies prefer this option as it helps improve customer experience, since callers can have better communication with agents who can understand them more easily. In addition, Filipino call center agents also provide excellent customer service, making them highly favored and professionals in the field. In recent years, the Philippine government has supported the growth of the call center industry, leading to a surge in employment opportunities in the country. According to the Philippine Call Center Industry, there are over 1 million full-time equivalent (FTE) employees in the industry. This is a huge leap from the 2,400 FTE workers who were employed in the country's first call center operation back in 1999.  The outsourcing boom in the Philippines started during the early 2000s when call center firms discovered the country's untapped, English-speaking talent pool. Notably, the country's low-cost environment had helped entice businesses that wanted to save on operating expenses but still provide quality customer service.  The rise of the call center industry in the Philippines has been a game-changer for the country's economy. It has contributed significantly to the creation of jobs, boosting the country's GDP, and increasing foreign investment in the economy. Moreover, the Philippines traditionally has a strong business relationship with the US, only strengthened by the outsourcing boom. Today, most of the country's call center clients are US-based corporations. The industry has enabled the Philippines to leverage its geopolitical relationships with the US and provided stability and growth to an ever-expanding global market. At present, the call center industry accounts for over 7% of the Philippines' gross domestic product (GDP) and is one of the significant drivers of the country's economy, competing with exports such as semi-conductors and remittances from overseas workers. Furthermore, the country's government's continued efforts to promote the growth of the outsourcing industry have led to the creation of more business opportunities and increased competitiveness among international firms. In conclusion, the rise of the Philippines' call center industry is a testament to the country's continuing economic growth and its ability to compete globally. With its loyal team of English-speaking agents, a low-cost operating environment, and support from the government, it has become a key player in the international outsourcing market. Undoubtedly, the industry's success is one of the best things that happened to the country and has given Filipinos the opportunity to showcase their world-class talent and skills in customer service.","(545, 21)","(CNN) -- It is 1a.m. at the Manila offices of VXi and nearly everyone is

A blind woman has spoken of her anger after an Uber taxi driver refused to
","A blind woman has spoken of her anger after an Uber taxi driver refused to pick her up apparently because she was with her guide dog. Amy Dixon says she ordered a cab through the firm's app in her home town of Darien in Connecticut on Tuesday. But when she went to open the door, she claims the driver sped off, leaving her and her dog Elvis stranded. 'Flabbergasted': Blind woman Amy Dixon claims an Uber taxi driver refused to pick her up because she was with her guide dog Elvis . She said: 'I was flabbergasted. I'm screaming at him, waving my arms like crazy thinking maybe he made a mistake because I was hoping it wasn't what I thought it was.' But her fears were confirmed around ten seconds later when she received a text saying the driver had cancelled the pick up, it was reported by NBC New York. Mrs Dixon, who lost her vision around seven years ago, managed to get another Uber car to take her home. Uber said it had fired the driver. 'Built to expand transportation options for all': Uber said it had fired the driver after being told of the incident . In a statement, it said: 'The Uber app is built to expand access to transportation options for all, including users with visual impairments and other disabilities. 'It is Uber's policy that any driver partner that refuses to transport a service animal will be deactivated from the Uber platform, which has been done in this case.' Mrs Dixon welcomed the response, but said all drivers needed to be educated about service dogs. She added: 'As soon as they sign a contract to be an Uber driver, they have to obey the law, plain and simple.' Uber is a ride-sharing service that allow users to request taxis through an app which are then dispatched to drivers. Uber drivers aren't employed by the company, but instead work on a freelance basis.","(371, 16)","A woman in Glasgow, Scotland claims that a driver for a popular ride-hailing service drove away as she attempted to enter his vehicle. Amy Dixon, 24, says she was left ""flabbergasted"" as the car accelerated away from her, making it clear he wasn't going to wait for her to get in. Dixon says she had simply been trying to open the door of the taxi when the driver sped off. ""I was flabbergasted and thinking maybe he had made a mistake,"" she said. ""But no, he was gone."" Dixon says she was left stranded and had to find an alternative mode of transport. What's more, Dixon later received a text message from the driver saying he had cancelled the pick-up. She says she was left confused by the message, as she had not asked for the ride to be cancelled. The ride-hailing service in question has come under fire in the past for the treatment of its drivers and the conditions they work under. However, this is one of the first incidents to be reported of a passenger claiming mistreatment by a driver.
 
The incident has reignited the debate around the regulation of ride-hailing services and passenger safety. Some have called for tighter regulations around driver behavior and passenger safety, while others argue that the current system is already sufficient. The ride-hailing service says it is ""extremely sorry"" for Dixon's experience and says it is investigating the matter. However, Dixon says she wants more to be done to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. She has called for stricter regulations and better training for drivers in order to ensure passenger safety. This is not the first time ride-hailing services have come under scrutiny for safety issues. In 2019, a woman in South Carolina was killed after getting into the wrong car, while in 2018, a woman in Arizona was killed after being hit by a self-driving car operated by a ride-hailing service. Overall, the incident shows the need for continued scrutiny and debate around the safety of ride-hailing services and their drivers, and the need for better regulation to ensure passenger safety. It also highlights the importance of ensuring that drivers are properly trained and held accountable for their behavior.","(418, 19)","A blind woman has spoken of her anger after an Uber taxi driver refused to

(CNN) -- The Arctic as we know it may soon be a thing of the
","(CNN) -- The Arctic as we know it may soon be a thing of the past. Musk ox in the Arctic check the spread of shrubs to the High Arctic, but promote grass growth. That's the message from Eric Post, lead scientist of a new report into the effects of climate change on life in the Arctic. Published in ""Science"" magazine, Post and his team of international scientist conducted the study during the fourth International Polar Year that ended in 2008. ""It seems no matter where you look -- on the ground, in the air, or in the water -- we're seeing signs of rapid change,"" said Post in a press statement. The report found that flora and fauna of the Arctic are responding in various ways to the region's changes in climate over the last 150 years, and more recently the 20 to 30 years where seasonal minimal sea ice coverage has declined by 45,000 square kilometers per year. With the decline in sea ice and snow, animals usually seen at lower latitudes are being found in more northerly regions, including red foxes that have been displacing native Arctic foxes.  View the gallery of Arctic life affected by climate change » . The report found that some native Arctic species have also benefited from climate change, including wild reindeer on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. With less snow cover and a longer growing season, these non-migratory reindeer have taken advantage of the increased plant abundance, with the result that reindeer populations and their ability to reproduce are up, while mortality is down. But other animals are not adapting well to rising temperatures and the effect on delicate ecosystems. Migratory caribou in low Arctic Greenland and elsewhere are declining in number as they have not been able to keep their calving season in synch with changes in plant growth. With the decline in caribou comes a knock-on effect to native Inuit hunters, according to the report's authors. Hotter summers could result in more insects and parasites that prey on the caribou, which could then also reduce the annual caribou harvest by local indigenous peoples. ""Inuit hunters at my study site in Greenland have all but given up on hunting caribou there. What will be the next component to disappear from their traditional lifestyle, a lifestyle that has worked for thousands of years?"" said Post. Iconic Arctic animals dependent sea ice, including Pacific walrus, ringed seal, hooded seal, ivory gull, narwhal and polar bear, are faring especially badly, said the report. The researchers found that polar bears and ringed seals, both of which give birth in lairs or caves under the snow, lose many newborn pups when the lairs collapse in unusually early spring rains. These species may be headed for extinction, said the report.","(521, 20)","A new study on climate change in the Arctic has found that the region has experienced dramatic changes in temperature, with some animals and plant life benefiting from rising temperatures while others are threatened by the decline in sea ice. The study was conducted during the Fourth International Polar Year, which ended in 2008, and was recently published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. It examined data collected over several decades and found that the Arctic has warmed at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world. The study found that some animals and plants in the Arctic have benefited from the warming temperatures, including certain types of birds, insects, and shrubs. These species have been able to thrive in areas that were previously too cold to support them. However, the decline in sea ice is threatening iconic species like the polar bear. The study found that polar bear populations have declined by more than 40 percent in some areas over the past decade, largely due to the loss of sea ice. The polar bear relies on sea ice for hunting, and as the ice melts, the bears are forced to spend more time on land, where they have a much harder time finding food. The decline in sea ice also has other far-reaching consequences. It is contributing to rising sea levels and changing ocean currents, which in turn affect weather patterns around the world. It is also making it easier for shipping companies to access previously inhospitable parts of the Arctic, which could have a huge impact on the region's ecosystem. ""We are seeing the Arctic change before our very eyes,"" said Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center and one of the authors of the study. ""And these changes will have a profound impact not just on the Arctic, but on the entire planet."" The study's authors say that urgent action is needed to address the challenges posed by climate change in the Arctic. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting key habitats and species, and promoting sustainable development that takes into account the unique needs of the region. ""Climate change in the Arctic is not just an environmental issue, it's also a social and economic issue,"" said Scambos. ""And if we don't act soon, the consequences will be dire not just for the Arctic, but for the entire planet.""","(452, 17)","(CNN) -- The Arctic as we know it may soon be a thing of the

","(CNN) -- A Marine lost at sea after bailing out of a MV-22 Osprey when it appeared it might crash in the Persian Gulf is believed to be the first American military casualty in support of U.S. operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Cpl. Jordan L. Spears, 21, was declared dead after search and rescue efforts to locate him were unsuccessful, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said in a statement released Saturday. Asked how Spears death will be classified, Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters the question was still being decided. ""Clearly, that squadron and that ship were in the Gulf, supporting Central Command operations. Some of those operations included operations in Iraq and Syria, at least tangentially, through at least some tangential way, support to those missions,"" Kirby said, according to a transcript. ""So there's no question that -- that this Marine's death is related to the operations that are going on, in some form or fashion."" Even so, he said he did not know whether the Marine's death would be formally classified as such. The branch of service typically determines how a service member's death is classified. The military has not detailed the Osprey's mission at the time of the incident, which remains under investigation. The Osprey, a tilt-rotor aircraft, was deployed as part of the Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group ""supporting operations in Iraq and Syria and throughout the region,"" the statement said. Spears, a crew chief, went missing Wednesday when the Osprey lost power shortly after takeoff from the USS Makin Island and dropped toward the water, according to the Navy. Spears and another crew member went into the water when it appeared the Osprey was about to crash, the Navy said. The pilots managed to get control of the Osprey and land it safely, according to the statement. Search and rescue crews found one crew member in the water, but were unable to locate Spears of Memphis, Indiana, it said. ""U.S. forces in the North Persian Gulf suspended a search and rescue operation for Spears Oct. 2, after efforts to locate him were unsuccessful,"" according to the statement. Spears was assigned to Marine Tiltrotor Squadron 163, Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Aircraft Wing with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California.","(447, 18)","Marine Cpl. Jordan L. Spears, a 21-year-old serving in the US military, has been declared dead by the Navy after an extensive search and rescue operation failed to find him. Spears vanished on Wednesday while on duty in Iraq, raising concerns about his safety and the nature of his disappearance. There is no doubt that Spears' death is related to ISIS operations, said John Kirby, the Pentagon's press secretary. Kirby emphasized that the Marines were operating in a volatile and dangerous area, and that troop safety and security was of the utmost importance. He also offered his condolences to Spears' family and friends, saying that their sacrifice would never be forgotten. Spears' death has not yet been classified, Kirby said. The investigation into his disappearance and subsequent death is ongoing, and officials are working to gather information about what happened. The US military has vowed to leave no stone unturned in its efforts to uncover the truth and bring anyone involved in the death of a US Marine to justice. The loss of Cpl. Spears is a tragic reminder of the high stakes and risks involved in military operations in the Middle East. The US military has been involved in the fight against ISIS for several years, and the battle shows no signs of ending soon. Spears is the latest American service member to die in the conflict, and his death underscores the challenges that the military faces in ensuring the safety of its personnel in a dangerous and unpredictable environment. For Spears' family and friends, the news of his death is heart-wrenching. He was a dedicated and respected member of the military, and his loss will be felt deeply by those who knew him. The Navy is offering support to his loved ones during this difficult time, and his memory will be honored and respected by all who knew him. The US military will continue to do all that it can to protect its members and ensure their safety in the face of threats from ISIS and other terrorist groups. The loss of Cpl. Spears is a tragedy, but it will not deter the country from fighting for peace and stability in the region. The memory of those who have given their lives in this cause will be honored, and their sacrifice will never be forgotten.","(428, 20)","(CNN) -- A Marine lost at sea after bailing out of a MV-22 Osprey when

","New York (CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced Thursday he has reimbursed the state of New Jersey for the cost of using a state police helicopter to travel with his wife to his son's high school baseball game. The Republican has come under fire from opposition lawmakers and the public since he touched down Tuesday near the ball field in Montvale, about 80 miles from Trenton, the capital. After initially refusing to reimburse the state, Christie has repaid $2,151 to cover the cost of his flights to the game, Christie said in a news conference. ""What I know about this business is, perception matters,"" Christie said. ""I'm not going to allow the media and the hacks of the Democratic power to ... get away from the matter because they want to have a circus."" Christie claimed he was using the helicopter to balance his responsibilities as a father with his busy schedule as governor. ""I'm governor 24/7, every single day, but I'm also a father,"" he said. Christie, who has taken 33 helicopter flights since assuming office last January, said he has been far more ""judicious"" in his helicopter use than other recent governors, citing Govs. Jim McGreevey, Thomas Kean and James Florio. ""If you look at the way I use this helicopter, it's not like I'm using it as a perk of office,"" he said. The Republican budget hawk added that according to the State Police, the travel does not cost taxpayers money, because as the pilots need the flying time in order to be certified. When asked, the governor reiterated that he will not be running for president in the coming election but has refused to ""rule out"" 2016. The GOP paid for a portion of the helicopter rides, $919, to cover the cost of Christie's flight from the ballgame to Princeton, where he met with GOP contributors visiting from Iowa, according to Andy Pratt of the New Jersey Treasury. Still, some Democrats were not swayed. ""To use these vehicles to shuttle between both a personal and a political activity is an outright abuse of taxpayer dollars,"" said Democrat Assemblywoman Joan Quigley. The former federal prosecutor, who earned a reputation for battling corruption, was elected on a platform of fiscal discipline and eliminating government waste and abuse. During his first year in office, Christie helped to pass a $29 billion budget, narrowing an $11 billion deficit with cuts in public-sector spending, including employee pensions and benefits. The governor has since called for some $200 million in tax cuts. He has focused on spending reductions on public unions -- particularly the state's powerful teachers' unions -- who often have said the governor has used them as an excuse for the state's broader financial troubles.","(537, 20)","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has made headlines yet again, this time over a helicopter ride he took to his son's baseball game in 2012 that cost taxpayers $2,151.

And so when I have an opportunity to go see my son pitch in a baseball game...I'm gonna go see my son pitch in a baseball game,"" Christie said during a press conference on Thursday. However, the story does not end there. It has also been reported that the state Republican party covered the cost of the governor's helicopter ride to a political event in Princeton that occurred after the baseball game. The state GOP paid $919 for the flight. This issue has caused controversy, especially among Democrats. Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle, a Democrat from Bergen County, called it an ""outright abuse of taxpayer dollars"". ""New Jerseyans should not be footing the bill for the governor's helicopter joyrides to political events,"" Huttle said in a statement. Christie's office has stated that the governor has only used the state helicopter for official business or personal reasons related to his role as governor. They also stated that the governor's use of the helicopter has decreased significantly since he took office in 2010. However, this news brings up the issue of politicians using taxpayer money for personal or political expenses. This has been a common critique of politicians in various levels of government, with some being accused of misusing funds or taking unnecessary trips on the dime of American taxpayers. While some may argue that Christie's use of the helicopter was justified due to the nature of his role as both a governor and a father, others argue that his use of taxpayer money for a personal event and then for a political one is not acceptable. As of now, the issue has sparked conversation and criticism, but it remains to be seen if any further action will be taken. It serves as a reminder that politicians must be careful with how they use taxpayer money and prioritize the needs of their constituents over personal or political interests.","(418, 17)","New York (CNN) -- New Jersey Gov.

","By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A Swiss designer has created a silk scarf which very closely resembles a meaty rasher of bacon. Entitled, the Fou Lard, its name plays on the French term for a thin scarf or handkerchief, 'Foulard', and also the French for bacon, which is simply: 'Lard'. Digitally printed on delicate silk, the hyper-realistic bacon scarf - not cheap at $165 - is admittedly a mouth-watering thing to behold, with detail all the way down to its 'crispy' black rolled hem. Introducing the Fou Lard: Swiss designer Natalie Luder designed this unusual silk scarf, which is digitally printed and costs $165 . The scarf's designer, Natalie Luder, writes on her website: 'My work is often inspired by topics of the realm of food culture. The comparison of appearance and reality, nature and culture, as well as the discussion about good and bad taste are fascinating aspects to me.' A quick glance through some of her other projects reveals a rather morbid fixation with dead animals. A necklace hung with moths, another made from 'horse teeth' and the ceramic recreation of an edible organ for example. Bacon style: The 100 per cent silk scarf appears to be keeping this woman nice and warm as she poses in arctic conditions . Almost edible: Even the blackened 'crispy' edges of the rolled hem closely resembles a delicious rasher of bacon . Swanky: Ms Luder released a limited number of the scarves in 2011, but they are yet to sell out . Bacon lover: Supermodel Cara Delevingne (pictured) has enjoyed a very public love affair with her favorite meaty snack, even tweeting herself in her very own pair of bacon-themed socks (left) Describing her unusual fares, Ms Luder writes: 'The wearer overtakes the qualities of the slaid animal and blazons himself with the heroic hunting story[sic].' You might assume the Fou Lard to be a fast-food fashion anomaly, but there appears to exist something of a bacon-themed clothing sub-culture in today's America. BaconFreak.com sells an entire line of bacon-inspired clothing. And supermodel of the moment Cara Delevingne regularly sings the praises of her favorite meaty snack, even joyously acquiring a pair of bacon-decorated socks for herself not too long ago. The Fou Lard was first issued by Ms Luder as a limited edition item in 2011, however, they are yet to sell out.","(451, 18)","Fashion lovers rejoice!

By . Marcus Townend For Mail Online . Roger Charlton is to run Al Kazeem
","By . Marcus Townend For Mail Online . Roger Charlton is to run Al Kazeem in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot a week on Saturday. The six-year-old, a three-time group one winner in 2013, has raced three times since returning to training this summer after encountering fertility problems at stud, winning the 10-furlong Group Three Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor before finishing fifth to The Grey Gatsby in the Irish Champion Stakes last time out. Charlton, whose dual Group Three winning miler Captain Cat tries to win his first Group Two prize in the Joel Stakes at Newmarket on Friday, said: ‘The step up in trip and step down in class is just Al Kazeem needs.’ Al Kazeem will run in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot a week on Saturday . Roger Charlton believes the step up in trip and step down in class is just what Al Kazeem needs . The Cumberland Lodge Stakes was an option for Jeremy Noseda’s Grandeur but the gelding, who has run three times without luck across the Atlantic this summer, will again be on his travel with a shot at the $1million Canadian International at Woodbine on October 19. The five-year-old won the Listed Foundation Stakes at Goodwood for the second year running but Noseda will be have to look for a new jockey in Canada. Wednesday’s rider Ryan Moore should be needed for Sir Michael Stoute-trained Hillstar, a winner at Newbury on Saturday. Noseda’s Newmarket colleague Roger Varian may have just won his first Classic with Kingston Hill in the St Leger but there was one surprising omission from his CV. Until Andre Atzeni-ridden 15-8 favourite American Artist passed the post first in the British Stallions Stud Maiden Stakes, Varian had never had a winner at Goodwood from 50 runners in his four-year training career. Varian confirmed that Kingston Hill was on course for a crack at the Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on October 5, saying: ‘It is all systems go – I have been very pleased with his since the Leger.’ Roger Varians says Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Cursory Glance might run again this season . Varian also refused to rule out the possibility that his Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Cursory Glance might run again this season. Moore was also successful on his father Gary’s Good Luck Charm. That stretched his title race lead to five (142-137) over Richard Hughes, who also picked up a two-day whip ban on runner-up Shadow Rock.","(460, 15)","Former champion racehorse Al Kazeem is set to take a step down in class after a brief hiatus caused by fertility problems. The six-year-old stallion has raced just three times since encountering the issue, and most recently finished fifth in the Irish Champion Stakes. Trainer Roger Charlton has acknowledged the challenges that Al Kazeem has faced in recent years, but insists that the horse is in good shape and ready for a fresh start. Speaking to reporters, Charlton expressed confidence that a step down in class is just what the stallion needs to regain his form and competitive edge. ""Al Kazeem has had some setbacks, including fertility issues that kept him off the track for a while,"" said Charlton. ""But despite these challenges, he's still a top-class racehorse with plenty of ability. I think that dropping down a level and competing against less challenging competition will be just what he needs to find his stride again."" Charlton's comments come after Al Kazeem's less-than-stellar performance in the Irish Champion Stakes, which saw the stallion finish behind several highly-rated competitors. While some analysts have questioned the horse's ability to compete at the highest levels of elite horse racing, Charlton remains confident that Al Kazeem has what it takes to succeed. ""Al Kazeem may not have won the Irish Champion Stakes, but he still put in a solid effort and showed that he's capable of competing against the best horses in the world,"" said Charlton. ""With a bit of fine-tuning and some time to adjust to the lower level of competition, I'm confident that he'll be back to his winning ways in no time."" While details of Al Kazeem's next race have yet to be confirmed, rumors suggest that the stallion may compete in the upcoming Group 3 Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot. This would be a step down from Al Kazeem's recent outings, and could provide the perfect opportunity for the stallion to regain his confidence and dominance on the racecourse. Regardless of where he next competes, Al Kazeem remains one of the most highly-regarded horses in the world of horse racing. With his impressive pedigree, formidable athleticism, and determined spirit, there's no doubt that he'll continue to captivate audiences and inspire awe-inspiring performances for years to come.","(427, 15)","By.

","By . Hannah Roberts . EU funding intended to help disaster victims has been diverted to the Mafia, according to a report by the European Parliament. Money for relief and reconstruction efforts following a devastating earthquake in the Italian city of L’Aquila were ‘misused’ and relayed to companies with links to organised crime, it warns.

The central Italian city of L'Aquila was devastated by a 5.9 magnitude . earthquake in 2009. Now it has been revealed that EU cash for disaster . relief and reconstruction may have fallen into the hands of the Mafia . Subcontractors were required to have mafia-free certification. But in a draft report on the effectiveness of this aid, Danish MEP Soren Bo Sondergaard reported serious allegations that part of the money was paid to companies with 'direct or indirect ties' to organised crime. Wanted criminals were even discovered at one premises rebuilt with EU funds, it found. The report also highlighted allegations by Anti-mafia prosecutor Olga Capasso that the funding had made L'Aquila the country's greatest challenge in combatting the mafia. Victims: Nearly Euro 500 million in EU solidarity funds went to L'Aquila . after the massive earthquake which destroyed thousands of homes . Some 10,000 buildings were destroyed by the quake while the medieval . centre of L'Aquila, which remains uninhabitable, is expected to take 25 . years to rebuild . She said: ‘Among the problems related to combating organised crime, Aquila is one of the biggest problems at national level'. The document also criticised work carried out as faulty, dangerous and unhealthy with poor quality or flammable building materials used. The highly critical report accuses the European Commission of negligence and of allowing fraud to take place on its watch. According to the report, wanted criminals were even discovered at one premises rebuilt with EU funds, it found . But the Commission rejected the allegation of misuse and insisted their distribution had been 'monitored carefully'. The huge quake killed more than 300 people and left thousands homeless.

In the aftermath of the disaster, the government and international organizations offered reconstruction funds to help rebuild the city and the lives of its people. However, a recent investigation has revealed that some of these funds were routed to firms with links to organized crime. According to the report, some of the work carried out by these firms was found to be faulty, dangerous, and even unhealthy. The investigators uncovered a number of cases where substandard materials were used, while safety regulations were ignored, putting the lives of workers and residents at risk. The report goes on to reveal that even wanted criminals were discovered at one of the premises that was rebuilt using EU funds. This news has reignited the conversation about the misuse of funds and the need for better accountability and transparency in the reconstruction process. The revelation has caused outrage among the citizens of L'Aquila and the broader Italian public who feel that they have been victimized twice - once by the earthquake and then by unscrupulous contractors who took advantage of the situation. There have been calls for an immediate investigation into the matter and for harsh penalties to be imposed on those responsible for fraudulently obtaining and misusing the funds. The Italian government has already promised to take swift action and punish those responsible. In a statement, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that ""this is a serious matter that cannot be ignored. We are determined to hold those involved accountable for their actions and ensure that the victims of the earthquake receive the assistance they deserve."" The L'Aquila earthquake is a tragic reminder of the importance of proper oversight when it comes to reconstruction efforts. The situation serves as a warning to other parts of the world that may face similar challenges in the aftermath of natural disasters. The international community must work together to ensure that reconstruction funds are used properly, for the benefit of those who need them the most.","(377, 15)","By. Hannah Roberts.

","The Confederation of African Football (CAF) will begin discussions on Tuesday over whether to find new hosts for next year’s African Nations Cup finals or cancel the tournament. CAF’s executive committee will meet in Cairo to decide what to do having rejected host Morocco’s request for a postponement. It insists on going ahead with the planned January 17 to February 8 dates even though the north African country wants a postponement over fears of a possible spread of the Ebola virus. Nigeria celebrate their 2013 triumph but the 2015 edition is in doubt after Morocco refused to host . CAF is sure to strip Morocco of the hosting rights and might begin disciplinary proceedings which could severely affect their participation in future African competitions. But CAF must also find a solution to the hosting of its showpiece event or face a heavy financial blow if the tournament has to be called off. Effectively, by ruling out moving the 16-team finals from its scheduled dates, CAF would have to find a new host. On Monday, Ghana joined the list of countries turning down the opportunity to stage the event. “The representation we have received from people in the health sector (means) it doesn’t look (like) Ghana is in a position to accepting hosting the tournament and we have conveyed this message to CAF,” said sports minister Mahama Ayariga . Egypt and South Africa have also issued a public ‘no’. CAF president Issa Hayatou is adamant that the tournament should go ahead this winter as planned . But CAF executive committee member Constant Omari suggested on Monday there was a plan to ensure the tournament would go ahead. “The financial damage and the consequences for CAF and its marketing partners would be too severe to call it off,” he told French radio. CAF media director Junior Binyam said a statement that CAF’s decision would be communicated only after the conclusion of the executive committee meeting, which could stretch into Wednesday. Morocco’s sports minister Mohamed Ouzzine told Reuters on Monday they had not heard from CAF since sending the regional governing body a letter on Saturday repeating their request for a postponement and had no idea what CAF’s decision would be.","(412, 15)","The Confederation of African Football's (CAF) executive committee is set to gather in Cairo to discuss the fate of the Africa Cup of Nations tournament. The upcoming tournament is scheduled to take place between January 17 and February 8, but Morocco has requested to postpone it due to fears over the Ebola virus. CAF rejected Morocco's request, citing the fact that the World Health Organization has not recommended any travel restrictions related to the virus, which has killed over 5,000 people in West Africa. CAF has stated that they will not postpone the tournament, but will consider moving the location of the games if necessary. Morocco's request for a postponement came as a surprise to many, as the country has not recorded any cases of Ebola. However, the Moroccan Football Federation argues that the large influx of visitors to the country during the tournament poses a significant risk. Moroccan authorities have reportedly taken measures to prepare for the tournament, including installing temperature scanners at airports and major ports, but CAF has stood firm on their decision to go ahead with the original dates. The potential impact of moving or postponing the tournament is significant. The Africa Cup of Nations is one of the biggest events on the continent, with millions of fans eagerly anticipating the chance to watch the best football teams in Africa compete. The postponement or relocation of the tournament would also have significant financial implications for CAF and the countries involved. Despite the concerns over Ebola, CAF has emphasized that they have taken every precaution to ensure the safety of players, officials, and fans. CAF's decision to go ahead with the tournament has received support from many African countries, including Guinea and Liberia, who hope that the tournament will help bring a sense of normality to countries affected by the virus. The executive committee's meeting in Cairo is expected to be a tense affair, with members of the Moroccan Football Federation hoping to convince CAF to reconsider their decision. However, given the financial and logistical challenges involved in changing the dates or location of the tournament, it seems unlikely that CAF will reverse their decision. The upcoming Africa Cup of Nations tournament promises to be an exciting event, with some of the most talented footballers in Africa preparing to showcase their skills. It remains to be seen how the Ebola outbreak will impact the tournament, but one thing is for sure - the eyes of the world will be on Africa in January and February, eagerly watching as the continent's best football teams compete for glory.","(473, 16)","The Confederation of African Football (CAF) will begin discussions on Tuesday over whether to find

Cameroon was awarded the right to host the AFCON in 2014, but since then, the country has been
plagued by political instability and violence. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it even

postpone the tournament until 2022.

president Ahmad Ahmad said, ""We are fully committed to organizing the AFCON in Cameroon as
planned. We have been working closely with the Cameroon government and the local organizing
committee to ensure that the tournament is a success.""
Ahmad also said that CAF is confident that Cameroon will be able to host a safe and successful
tournament. He added, ""We are aware of the challenges that Cameroon is facing, but we believe that
with our support, they will be able to overcome them.""

COVID-19 pandemic.

A substitute teacher at a Chicago school addressed a group of 13-year-olds using the N-word
","A substitute teacher at a Chicago school addressed a group of 13-year-olds using the N-word and referring to them as 'slaves'. Mea Thompson and three of her friends say the teacher at first referred to them as 'African-American', which the girls objected to as they are not of African heritage. The female teacher then used the N-word, which the group claim she then repeated throughout the class, referring to them as 'slaves'. Shocked: Eighth-grade-students Mea Thompson and Zaria Daniel say the substitute teacher called them the N-word during a social studies class at their school in a Chicago suburb . The incident took place at a middle school in Carol Stream, a suburb to Chicago, earlier this week. Four students, all 13, say they were busy working on a project about the Cold War during a social studies class headed by the teacher. The students say the teacher approached them and referred to them as ‘African-American’ ‘All four of us that were sitting there got offended because none of us are from Africa. I’m Jamaican. So we said, “Can you please not call us that?”’ Mea Thompson told NBC. ‘She continued to call us that and said, “It’s the politically correct term.” Then she said, “Well, back then you guys would be considered the N-word”.’ Following complaints, the substitute teacher was interviewed about the incident and confirmed the girls claims were true . According to Thompson and classmate Zaria Daniel, the teacher used the N-word throughout the class and referred to the group as 'slaves'. The girls say one student left the classroom in tears. Following the girls’ complaints, the substitute teacher was interviewed about the incident and confirmed that what the girls claimed was true. A spokesperson for the school district has said the teacher will not be asked back to the school. Carol Stream Police also said they are aware of the incident and are investigating.","(369, 15)","A substitute teacher at a Chicago school has sparked controversy after referring to a group of teen girls as African-American, despite at least one of them having Jamaican heritage.

The girls, who are all students at the school, say they were shocked and upset by the teacher's comments. ""I couldn't believe what I was hearing,"" one of the girls told reporters. ""She kept calling us African-American even though we told her that wasn't accurate. And then when she started using the N-word, it was just unbelievable."" The girls say they confronted the teacher about her use of the N-word, but she continued to use it and make references to ""slaves."" They reported the incident to school administrators, who launched an investigation. In a statement to the media, Lincoln Park High School condemned the substitute's behavior and said she would not be asked back to the school. ""We take this matter very seriously and have launched a full investigation,"" the statement read. ""We will not tolerate any instances of racism or discrimination at our school. The substitute teacher involved has been informed that their services are no longer required."" The incident has sparked outrage among students and parents at the school, with many calling for the substitute to be banned from teaching altogether.

""We need to hold our educators to a higher standard and make sure that incidents like this never happen again.""

","By . Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 10:21 EST, 24 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:05 EST, 24 October 2013 . A grandfather from Louisville, Kentucky is in the best shape he's ever been in his life - but just a few years ago he was overweight and couldn't walk without a cane. Fitness group BarStarzz introduced Robert, 64, to the world on its YouTube channel. The buff senior says he only began exercising when he was 56 years old and was introduced to his latest fitness obsession, calisthenics, less than two years ago. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Before and after: At 56, Robert was overweight and had difficulty working, and now he feels like a teenager . Fitness friends: Robert (center) with some of his Barstarzz buddies . Waving the flag: Robert says everyone can get fit if they devote an hour or two to exercise every day . 'I discovered calisthenics watching BarStarzz on YouTube about a year and a half ago and I decided I would give it a whirl and fell in love with it,' he says. In the video, Robert performs exercises a man half his age would have difficulty with, such as the 'flag', where he holds himself horizontally from a pole. 'Stuff people says I can't do, I'm proving them wrong, that I can do this stuff,' he says. Robert explains how in his mid-fifties, he was badly out of shape. Unhappy: Robert was unfit and wanted to change his life when he began going to the gym . Better than ever: Now, the grandfather feels healthier and happier than ever . 'At 56 years old, I was overweight, couldn't really walk, had braces and was walking on canes and walkers. I wasn't really happy with my life and the way things was going,' he says. He couldn't keep up with his children or grandchildren and he wasn't in good health. After watching fitness videos on YouTube, Robert decided to go to the gym. He was undeterred by people who questioned his abilities because of his age and now, he's fitter and stronger than he's ever been before. 'I feel better now than I did when I was 18 years old,' he says. 'My advice to other people is to take an hour or two a day and get started on the calisthenics, cardio, weight-lifting - whatever you can do. It pays off in the long run, you feel a lot better.'","(482, 28)","Robert, a 64-year-old grandfather from Kentucky, has amazed his friends and family by completely transforming his health and lifestyle over the past eight years. At 56 years old, Robert was overweight, out of shape, and could barely walk without a cane. He felt tired and unwell most of the time, and was worried that he might not be around to see his grandchildren grow up. However, something changed in Robert's mindset in 2013 when he decided that he had enough of feeling tired and sluggish. He started reading up on nutrition and exercise, determined to make a change in his life. Robert began by gradually cutting down on processed foods and sugary drinks, and replacing them with healthier options like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. He also started going for short walks every day, even if it was just around the block. Over time, Robert's body started to respond positively to these changes. He felt more energetic, more alert, and more optimistic about his health and future. In fact, he started feeling better than he had in decades. Encouraged by his progress, Robert decided to take things to the next level. He joined a gym and started working out regularly, with a focus on weight lifting and cardio. At first, it was tough going, but Robert was determined to push through the discomfort. Years of dedication and hard work paid off for Robert. Today, he is in the best shape of his life. He has lost about 60 pounds and has gained lean muscle mass. He can now walk without a cane and has also become an inspiration for many others who are looking to turn their health around. Robert says that he feels better than he did when he was 18 years old. He believes that his transformation is a testament to what anyone can achieve with the right mindset and support. ""I never thought I could do this, but I did. If I can do it, anyone can do it,"" Robert says. Robert's story is a reminder that it's never too late to start taking care of our health.

Flu jabs can halve the risk of heart attacks in middle-aged men, according to a
","Flu jabs can halve the risk of heart attacks in middle-aged men, according to a study. The vaccine is already given to people with chronic conditions, including heart disease. But researchers say the NHS should consider offering it to everyone from 50 to 64. The study examined hospital data for 559 patients over the age of 40, around half of whom had suffered a heart attack. Benefits: The flu vaccine could help cut the risk of a heart attack in middle-aged men by up to a half . Nose and throat swabs and blood samples were taken when the patients were admitted and again four to six weeks later. The results showed around one in eight of the heart attack patients had recently had flu, compared with just under 7 per cent in the comparison group. Half of all the patients had received the flu jab that year. Flu had not been diagnosed in around one in ten of those who had the infection, suggesting it may be missed in hospital patients who turn up with other problems, the Australian experts reported in the journal Heart. While the research showed that flu did not increase the risk of a heart attack, having the jab appeared to be protective. It cut the chance of having an attack by 45 per cent. Deadly: Previous research has suggested that the flu virus can cause blood to thicken or arteries to inflame . Previous research has shown that flu may encourage blood to thicken or prompt an inflammatory response in arteries that are already narrowed, which could lead to a blockage and a heart attack. But the report authors, from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said: ‘Even a small effect of influenza vaccination in preventing (heart attacks) may have significant population health gains.’ Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘The flu can lead to serious illness, so getting your flu jab is vital if you have, or are at risk of, heart disease. It’s why many heart patients who are deemed at high risk are already offered the vaccination as a matter of routine.’ Dr John Watson, head of the respiratory diseases department at Public Health England, said: ‘We welcome this interesting research on the flu vaccination’s effects. ‘The study results are a timely reminder that susceptible patients should have their flu jab this winter.’","(448, 16)","A new study suggests that the NHS should consider giving the flu vaccine to everyone between the ages of 50 and 64. Researchers warn that the flu can cause blood to thicken, raising the risk of heart attack and stroke, particularly in older adults. The study was conducted by researchers at Imperial College London and published in the journal Heart. They looked at data from more than 60,000 adults in the UK, aged 40 to 79, for an average of 9.5 years. They found that those who had had the flu vaccine were 18% less likely to have a first heart attack or stroke, and 16% less likely to die from any cause, during the study period. Previous studies have shown a link between the flu and blood clotting, but this is the first large-scale study to look at the potential benefits of the flu vaccine on cardiovascular health. The researchers say their findings provide strong evidence that the flu vaccine should be given to more adults, particularly those in middle age. ""Given the potential implications of our findings for older adults, and with flu season just around the corner, our study should act as a wake-up call for the NHS to reconsider its flu vaccine policy,"" said lead author Dr Nisha Mehta. Currently, the NHS offers the flu vaccine to everyone over the age of 65, pregnant women, frontline health and social care workers, and those with certain underlying health conditions. However, a recent study found that less than half of those eligible for the vaccine actually received it last year. ""Expanding the flu vaccine programme to include middle-aged adults could save lives and reduce the burden on the NHS during flu season,"" said co-author Dr Paddy Allan. ""More needs to be done to educate the public about the benefits of the flu vaccine and to ensure that those who need it most are getting it."" The researchers also noted that their study did not take into account the potential benefits of the flu vaccine on respiratory infections, which can be particularly dangerous for older adults and those with chronic health conditions. With flu season fast approaching, health experts are urging the public to get vaccinated. The flu vaccine is available from GPs and pharmacies, and is free for those who are eligible. The NHS advises that the vaccine is the best protection against flu, and can also reduce the spread of the virus in the community. In conclusion, the latest study shows that there could be a significant benefit to expanding the flu vaccine programme to include middle-aged adults. It has been found that this group is at risk of heart attack and stroke due to the flu causing blood to thicken. With the winter months coming quickly, it is important to consider taking the vaccination to reduce the spread of the virus and protect from the potential fatal consequences associated.","(533, 19)","Flu jabs can halve the risk of heart attacks in middle-aged men, according to a

The Portuguese forward had been linked with a return to Manchester United next summer . 'It is an issue that is not important, what matters is Madrid,' replied Ronaldo. 'It is fine for me personally, I want to help this shirt. On these topics, it is not for me to speak out.' Asked about rumours of a new bid from United for him, he said: 'They are all speculations about my future ... My future is Madrid.

Louis van Gaal also spoke publicly about the player, insisting he would love to sign him, though also admitting he thought Madrid wouldn't sell him. A package of around £120m would be needed to bring Ronaldo back to Old Trafford, something which may be too much for United with the prospect of Radamel Falcao signing permanently next summer.

(CNN) -- Longtime men's college basketball coach Rick Majerus, who led Utah to the NCAA
","(CNN) -- Longtime men's college basketball coach Rick Majerus, who led Utah to the NCAA final in 1998, died Saturday from heart problems. He was 64. Majerus recently left Saint Louis University, where he had coached for the past five years, for health reasons. ""Nobody loved basketball and teaching kids more that Rick,"" Billikens interim head coach Jim Crews said in a statement. ""His passion for the game and the coaching profession was unparalleled. Rick was a true friend and was always there when needed. I, along with so many others, am going to miss him."" Majerus had ongoing health problems for years, dating back to his days as Utah's coach. Saint Louis director of athletics Chris May said the Billikens team was informed Saturday afternoon that Majerus' condition was deteriorating. The school announced November 19 that Majerus would not return to coach because of his heart condition. In 25 years, Majerus coached at four schools, taking 12 teams to the NCAA tournament. He had just one losing season. His record was 517-216, which included two 30-win seasons and 15 20-win seasons. Majerus got his start at Marquette as an assistant to Al McGuire. He was at Marquette from 1983 to 1986 and then at Ball State from 1987 to 1989. The apex of Majerus' career came at Utah, where he went 323-95 from 1989 to 2004. In 1998, he led the Utes to the NCAA championship game, losing to Kentucky. Three of Majerus' players at Utah were NBA draft picks -- including Keith Van Horn as the No. 2 overall pick in 1997. ""Rick left a lasting legacy at the University of Utah, not only for his incredible success and the national prominence he brought to our basketball program, but also for the tremendous impact he made on the young men who were fortunate enough to play on his teams,"" Utah Director of Athletics Chris Hill said in a statement. ""His standard of excellence extended beyond the basketball court and into the academic and personal success of his players. He will be deeply missed and we grieve for his family and all of his friends."" During Majerus' final stop, at Saint Louis, the Billikens went 95-69 under his tenure. Last season, Majerus led Saint Louis to the round of 32 in the NCAA tournament. It was the program's first NCAA tournament win since 1998. ""Coach Majerus put his heart and soul into the Billiken program, and for that we will be eternally grateful,"" May said in a statement. ""What I will remember most about Rick's tenure at SLU was his enduring passion to see his players excel both on and off the court. Wins and losses meant a lot to him, but no more than to see our student-athletes succeed in the classroom. He truly embraced the term 'student-athlete,' and I think that will be his lasting legacy.""","(555, 29)","The basketball world is mourning the loss of coaching legend Rick Majerus, who passed away at the age of 64. Majerus was known for his deep love of the game and a dedication to teaching children that went unmatched in his profession. ""Nobody loved basketball and teaching kids more than Rick,"" said a Saint Louis coach who had the honor of working alongside Majerus. ""He was a true mentor to so many young players and he will be deeply missed."" Majerus was highly regarded in the basketball community for his impressive 25-year coaching career, during which he had just one losing season. He coached for several programs including Marquette, Utah, Ball State, and Saint Louis University, where he spent his final five seasons. At Utah, Majerus compiled an incredible 323-95 record from 1989 to 2004, cementing his legacy as one of the all-time greats. But it was not just his success on the court that made him an exceptional coach. Majerus was known for emphasizing the importance of success in the classroom as well. He believed that his job as a coach was not just to create winning teams, but to help players prepare for success in all aspects of their lives. This philosophy was evidenced by his commitment to academic success. Majerus was a great advocate for his players, and would always make sure they were meeting academic requirements before focusing on basketball. He even went so far as to teach a remedial English course at Utah in order to help his players succeed in their studies. Majerus' dedication to his players was not just limited to their academic success, however. He was known for building deep, meaningful relationships with his players, often staying in touch with them long after their playing days had ended. His players universally spoke of him as a mentor and friend, someone who had a profound impact on their lives. Many of Majerus' former players and coaching colleagues expressed their grief and condolences upon news of his passing. Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, who played for Majerus at LSU in the 1980s, said ""Coach Majerus was like a father figure to me. He believed in me when no one else did and I will always be grateful for that."" While Majerus may be gone, his legacy in the basketball world will continue to live on. His impact on the game and on the lives of the players he coached is immeasurable, and the lessons he taught will continue to inspire generations of sportsmen and women for years to come.","(473, 21)","(CNN) -- Longtime men's college basketball coach Rick Majerus, who led Utah to the NCAA

Bag carrier: David Mellor leaves a radio station with an unknown woman on Saturday .
","Bag carrier: David Mellor leaves a radio station with an unknown woman on Saturday . If David Mellor was hoping to blend in with the crowd, this bag was not the way to do it. Covered in gaudy pink swirls, it stuck out like a sore thumb as he walked through Leicester Square in central London on his way home from presenting his LBC radio show. But as he strolled out with a woman who left the offices with him, he looked perfectly at ease – and between them, they even managed to get a taxi, despite Mr Mellor’s recent rant at a driver. The former Tory minister, 65, was caught on tape last month calling a cabbie a ‘sweaty, stupid little git’ when he became furious at the route taken by the driver after a visit to Buckingham Palace, where Mr Mellor’s partner Lady Cobham had received a CBE. Mr Mellor yelled: ‘I’ve been in the Cabinet, I’m an award-winning broadcaster, I’m a Queen’s Counsel’, before demanding: ‘Who are you to question me?’ Cabbies vowed to refuse to pick up Mr Mellor as a result. But on Saturday, when these pictures were taken, his unusual bag – and not his language – was the most colourful thing on display. An onlooker said: ‘He came out of the radio station with the woman and they walked through the square. She raised her arm to hail the taxi. ‘As soon as it stopped, they both stepped out on the street and Mr Mellor opened the door for her, said something to the driver then got in himself. There didn’t seem to be any problem.’ It was unclear if Mr Mellor was, in an act of chivalry, carrying the eye-catching bag for the unknown woman, who herself was carrying a large black and white bag, or if it was his own. Scroll down for video . Mellor carries the fetching pink bag after his friend manages to hail a taxi in central London on Saturday .

The incident occurred after Mellor had just finished his radio show and was walking through central London with an unknown woman. He was carrying a bag when he hailed a cab. The video footage that surfaced online shows Mellor approaching the cab and asking if it was available. The driver responds that he is. Mellor then proceeds to ask the cab driver if he has a credit card machine, to which the driver replies that he does not. Mellor then turns to the unknown woman with him and says that they will have to find another cab. It is at this point that the situation quickly turns sour as Mellor calls the cabbie a ""sweaty, stupid little git"" before walking away. The incident was quickly picked up by the media, and cabbies across London vowed to refuse to pick up Mellor in the future. However, Mellor was given a ride on Saturday despite the previous incident. It is unclear whether he apologized to the driver or not. The incident has once again highlighted the strained relationship between London cabbies and their customers. Taxi drivers in London have been known to refuse customers if they do not agree to pay in cash or if the journey is not long enough. Furthermore, some drivers have been known to take long, unnecessary routes in order to increase the fare. Mellor, for his part, has faced criticism for his behavior. Many have called for him to apologize to the cabbie and to the rest of the London taxi community. Some have even gone as far as to call for Mellor to be banned from using London cabs altogether. The incident has also raised questions about celebrity behavior in public. Mellor is not the first celebrity to be caught on camera behaving poorly towards the public. Many have argued that celebrities should be held to higher standards of behavior given their influence on the public. In conclusion, the incident involving David Mellor and the London cab driver has once again brought to the fore the strained relationship between cabbies and their customers. It remains to be seen whether Mellor will apologize for his behavior and whether he will be banned from using London cabs in the future.","(428, 22)","Bag carrier: David Mellor leaves a radio station with an unknown woman on Saturday.

By . Anna Hodgekiss . Bob Day, 83, waited a year to have the tumour
","By . Anna Hodgekiss . Bob Day, 83, waited a year to have the tumour investigated - by which time it was the size of a football . A grandfather had a tumour the size of a football removed from his scrotum after waiting a year to see his doctor about it. The 9lb (4kg) growth was so bad that Bob Day’s relatives could spot it though his clothes and told him to go to the doctor. Today the retired butcher from Speke, LIverpool, praised surgeons at the Royal Liverpool Hospital who managed to remove the huge growth. Mr Day had a sarcoma - a rare type of cancer that affects soft tissues, muscles and bone. He is now urging others not to wait so long before being investigated. The 83-year-old noticed the swelling in his groin area but didn't want to make a fuss - so left it. But over the next 12 months it gradually got bigger and bigger. He said: 'You could see it in my trousers. The tumour was getting bigger and bigger but I kept putting it off - I don’t like a fuss. 'I wasn’t in pain. If I had been in pain, I probably would have gone earlier. I was still doing the gardening and doing everything as normal.' It was his daughter Jennifer, 54, and son Stephen who spotted the lump - and the fact their father was getting tired and sleeping in his chair more often. Mr Day's GP referred him to a urologist at Liverpool's Broadgreen hospital last December and after a series of scans, he was booked in for surgery in February. His daughter Jennifer, 54, added: 'With the size of it, I thought they were going to say it’s too late, there’s nothing we can do. 'When you think of cancer, you think that’s it. It is remarkable what they have done for him.' Mr Day will have more scans every three months to make sure he remains cancer-free. His surgeon, Mr Coonoor Chandrasekar, said: 'Lumps and bumps are common. One in 100 turn out to be a sarcoma. 'Sarcomas are treatable and if people come forward for treatment earlier, it can be easier.' 'If Bob hadn’t had it checked, because of the way tissue breaks down, it could have spread to his lungs which can prove fatal.' Mr Day was diagnosed with sarcoma. These are rare cancers that develop in the muscle, bone, nerves, cartilage, tendons, blood vessels and the fatty and fibrous tissues. His tumour was found to weigh a staggering 4kg .","(502, 28)","Bob Day, an 83-year-old resident of Greater Manchester, had to wait for an entire year before seeking his doctor's advice on the growth in his thigh. Recently, he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called sarcoma that affects the muscles, bones, and tissues inside the body. By the time the tumour was removed from Bob's thigh, it weighed a startling 9lb! Sarcoma is a type of cancer that often goes undiagnosed because its symptoms are subtle and easily confused with other less serious conditions. The cancerous tumour develops in the connective tissues that support the body, like cartilage, muscles, and bones. It's a rare condition, accounting for only 1% of all cancer diagnoses. Bob's diagnosis came as a shock to him and his family. After waiting for so long, he finally went to the doctor's clinic, where the sarcoma was detected. He underwent surgery to remove the tumour, which took about four hours. The size of the tumour was enormous, which made the entire process more difficult. Bob's family has been extremely supportive throughout his journey. He says his daughter and grandchildren have been his ""rocks"" and have helped him immensely. His family has also been updating a Facebook group that was started to keep everyone informed about his condition. Sarcoma can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, but the success rate of treatment depends on the stage of the cancer and the location of the tumour. Early detection is essential for the best chances of survival. Unfortunately, Bob's case was quite advanced, but he is now undergoing chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer from spreading. Bob is a remarkable man who has lived through many different events throughout his life. He was born just before World War II and lived through the Blitz. He's a veteran of the British Army and has experienced his fair share of health issues over the years. Nonetheless, he remains determined to overcome this obstacle too. Bob's story highlights the importance of paying attention to our bodies and seeking medical attention if something just doesn't feel right. Waiting for an extended period can be dangerous, especially if it's something as serious as cancer. Bob's family urges others to take a proactive approach and seek timely medical help when necessary. In conclusion, Bob Day exemplifies the bravery and resilience required to tackle a rare form of cancer like sarcoma. Despite the difficult journey he has experienced, Bob remains in high spirits and focused on his treatment. We wish him a speedy recovery and good health in the years to come!","(492, 26)","By.

Sarcoma is a rare form of cancer that develops in the connective tissues
of the body, such as muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and
ligaments. There are two main types of sarcoma: soft tissue sarcoma and
bone sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcoma can develop anywhere in the body,
including the arms, legs, chest, abdomen and pelvis. Bone sarcoma can
develop in any bone in the body, but is most common in the long bones
of the arms and legs. Symptoms of sarcoma can vary depending on the
type and location of the tumour. However, some common symptoms include
pain, swelling, a lump or mass, and changes in the appearance of the
affected area. Treatment for sarcoma typically involves surgery to
remove the tumour, followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.
In some cases, amputation may be necessary. The prognosis for sarcoma
varies depending on the type and stage of the disease, as well as the

","By . Martha Kelner for Mail On Sunday . Follow @@marthakelner . Lynsey Sharp was robbed of her golden moment at the European Championships two years ago, having her silver medal upgraded a year later when Russian winner Yelena Arzhakova was revealed to be a drugs cheat. The 24-year-old wants to defend her title ‘properly’ in Zurich, starting in the heats of the 800 metres on Wednesday morning. But she has learned from experience that things are rarely simple where her career is concerned. In the running: Sharp is determined to defend her European title when the heats begin on Wednesday . Inspirational: The athlete scrawled the message 'Get out strong, commit' on her hand in Glasgow . Sharp will run despite an oozing wound on her leg which repeatedly gets infected. It requires surgery but the Scot postponed an operation in order to compete at a home Commonwealth Games. That nearly didn’t happen either. She spent the hours before the final hooked up to a drip at a medical centre in the athletes’ village suffering from a severe sickness bug, but recovered and ran a superb race to win silver. Her tribulations continued with a ‘nightmare journey’ to Zurich. ‘It took 16 hours to get from Loughborough,’ she said. ‘Our 1.40pm flight was cancelled and the next one at 7.45pm only had business-class seats, so I spent nine hours at Heathrow and didn’t arrive until midnight.’ Sharp became Scotland’s sweetheart after her poignant victory in Glasgow, which she partly dedicated to her father Cameron Sharp, who won five Commonwealth medals before suffering life-threatening injuries in a road accident in 1991. Hero: Her performance in the home games has made Sharp something of a star in Scotland . Rearranged Podium: Yelena Arzhakova (centre) had her gold medal stripped giving Sharp the title . An impromptu decision to scrawl a note reading, ‘Get out strong, commit’, in black marker pen on the back of her hand had a profound effect on some fans. ‘I’ve had so many messages from people saying, “I’ve had surgery, you’ve inspired me”, and some have written things on their hands for charity walks and stuff. ‘I’ve never written on myself before but I felt I needed something to take me away from the emotion. ‘I don’t know if I’ll need it in Zurich.’ Sharp has run the fourth-fastest two-lap time in Europe this season and stands a good chance of winning a medal in Switzerland. ‘It would be nice to win European gold properly and experience the full thing, rather than getting my medal a year and a bit later,’ she said.","(513, 22)","Scottish 800m runner Lynsey Sharp is preparing to defend her gold medal in the 2012 European Athletics Championship, which she was awarded after the original winner failed a drugs test. The championship will commence on Wednesday at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. Sharp's journey to this competition began in 2012, when she competed in the European Athletics Championship in Helsinki, Finland. She finished in second place behind Yelena Arzhakova of Russia, who was subsequently stripped of her gold medal when she failed a drugs test. Sharp was later awarded the gold medal and has been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to defend her title ever since. The 2018 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow saw Sharp win the silver medal in the 800m race, following a close battle with South African athlete Caster Semenya. Sharp has been vocal in her support for increased regulation in women's athletics, particularly in regards to the participation of female athletes with higher testosterone levels. Despite this, she has remained focused on her own performance and is confident in her ability to defend her gold medal. In a recent interview, Sharp stated: ""I feel like I've become a lot stronger in the last two years. Mentally and physically, I feel like I'm in a really good place."" Sharp will face stiff competition in her quest to retain her gold medal, with a number of strong athletes also set to compete in the 800m race. Among them is Swiss athlete Selina Büchel, who won the bronze medal at the World Championships in London last year. Despite the challenges ahead, Sharp is determined to give her all in the competition, stating: ""I always try to run my best race and see where that gets me. I'll be going out there to try and do my best and defend my title."" Sharp's performance in the championship will be eagerly anticipated by athletics fans around the world, as she seeks to add yet another impressive achievement to her already illustrious career.","(370, 15)","By.

awarded gold in the 2012 Olympics after the original winner failed a drugs
test. The 800m runner now has a chance to defend her Olympic title starting
on Wednesday. She won silver in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last week.
Lynsey Sharp was awarded gold in the London Olympics in 2012 after the
original winner failed a drugs test. The 800-metre runner has a chance to
defend her Olympic title starting on Wednesday. Last week, she won silver in
the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
In 2012, the original winner of the women’s 800-metre race at the London
Olympics, Caster Semenya, was stripped of her gold medal after failing a
drugs test. The South African runner was found to have high levels of
testosterone, which is banned by the International Association of Athletics
Federations (IAAF). As a result, Lynsey Sharp was awarded the gold medal.
Now, four years later, Lynsey Sharp has the opportunity to defend her
Olympic title at the 2016 Rio Olympics. She will compete in the women’s
800-metre race, which starts on Wednesday.
Last week, Lynsey Sharp won silver in the 800-metre event at the
Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. She finished behind Kenya’s Eunice Sum, who
set a new Commonwealth Games record with a time of 1:56.18. Lynsey Sharp
crossed the finish line in 1:57.69, just 0.51 seconds behind Sum.
Despite her impressive performance at the Commonwealth Games, Lynsey Sharp
will face tough competition at the Rio Olympics. Her main rival is Kenya’s
Faith Kipyegon, who set a new world record in the women’s 1500-metre race
earlier this year. Kipyegon ran a time of 3:50.37, breaking the previous
world record of 3:51.95 set by Genzebe Dibaba of Ethiopia in 2015.
However, Lynsey Sharp is confident that she can win gold at the Rio
Olympics. In an interview with the BBC, she said, “I’m really excited to be
going to Rio. I know it’s going to be a tough competition, but I’m ready to
give it my all. I’ve been training hard and I’m feeling strong. I’m
confident that I can win gold.”
Lynsey Sharp’s chances of winning gold at the Rio Olympics will depend on
her ability to handle the pressure and perform at her best on the day. She
will also need to avoid any injuries or setbacks in the lead-up to the
competition. However, if she can maintain her focus and stay healthy, she
has a good chance of defending her Olympic title and adding another gold
medal to her collection.","(505, 27)","By . Martha Kelner for Mail On Sunday . Follow @@marthakelner . Lynsey Sharp was

The 24-year-old, who won a silver medal in the same event at the 2014
Commonwealth Games in her home city of Glasgow, was disqualified for a
failing a drugs test.
Sharp, who won gold in the 4x400m relay at last year's European
Championships in Zurich, was given a two-year ban by the International
Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) after testing positive for the
diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used to treat high blood pressure.
The IAAF said the drug was found in a urine sample taken after the
semi-finals of the Commonwealth Games on July 26.
Sharp has the right to appeal against the IAAF's decision to the Court of
Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.
She said: 'I'm absolutely devastated. I've worked so hard to get to this
point and it's all been taken away from me.
'I don't know what I'm going to do now. I don't even know if I'll be able to
compete again.
'It's not fair that I'm being punished for something I didn't do. I'm not a
doper and I've never taken drugs in my life.'
Sharp's coach, Andy Young, said he was 'shocked' and 'disappointed' by the
decision.
He added: 'She's a clean athlete. She's never taken anything in her life.
She's not a doper and she's never been a doper.
'We're going to appeal. We're not going to give up. We'll take it as far as
we can.'
