Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest
","Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest of his Uruguay team-mates on Thursday. England take on Uruguay later this week in what Hart believes is a 'do-or-die' match because of Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Italy. Suarez is back in full training following a knee injury and is expected to start the match at the Itaquerao Stadium. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez looking sharp in training . Prepared: Joe Hart says he is ready for the challenge of Uruguay on Thursday . Suarez enjoyed a prolific year with Liverpool last season, scoring 27 league goals, and Uruguay also have the considerable talents of Diego Forlan and Edinson Cavani to call upon. Hart has been studying videos of all the Uruguay players, though, to make sure he is ready to stop whatever the opposition throws at him on Thursday. 'Dave [Watson, goalkeeping coach] studies the tapes of Uruguay and we are well aware of their strikers and their pattern of finishing,' England's number one told TheFA.com. 'We had a lot of sharp shots around the . box (in training). We cover in general, but we specify short, sharp . shots as they have got a lot of boys who get it out of their feet and . bang it.' England need to beat Uruguay and Costa Rica to guarantee their progression to the knock-out stages. Eyes on the prize: Luis Suarez trained on Tuesday and is expected to be fit to face England . Kicking into gear: Luis Suarez says he is 100 per cent fit to face England after his knee problems . No surprises: Joe Hart has faced Luis Suarez countless times in the Premier League . Head boy: Mario Balotelli (left) scored the winning goal as England lost to Italy last Saturday . A draw and a win could be enough for England to qualify, providing other results go their way, but Hart sees Thursday's game as a must-win. 'We've got to win in Sao Paulo,' said the 27-year-old, who earned his 41st cap in Manaus. 'We did play well (against Italy) and there were a lot of positives, but the outcome was not want we wanted and it's not what we've come here for. 'We've put ourselves in a do-or-die situation, which we are prepared for. We need to win. We didn't go into the Italian game with any intention of losing - it's done now, we've moved on.'","(469, 24)","England goalkeeper Joe Hart has been closely monitoring footage of Uruguay's strikers ahead of their crucial World Cup clash on Thursday. Hart has said that Roy Hodgson's side are fully aware that they must win the match against Uruguay, following their narrow defeat to Italy in their opening game. Hart also revealed that he has been closely studying Uruguay’s forwards, particularly the returning Luis Suarez, who has now resumed full training following an injury. Suarez is expected to start against England, and Hart knows that he and his team-mates will need to be on top form if they are to prevent the world's most in-form striker from finding the net. England's preparations for the Uruguay game have been disrupted by a number of injuries, most notably to captain Steven Gerrard and centre-back Gary Cahill. However, Hart remains confident that Hodgson's side can still secure a crucial victory, despite their injury setbacks. England are also hoping to welcome back Danny Welbeck for the game, after the Manchester United forward missed the opening fixture through injury. Welbeck's pace and energy could prove to be a key asset for England, particularly if they look to exploit the aging Uruguayan defence. However, England will also need to be wary of the threat posed by Uruguay's attacking players, particularly Suarez, who has been in sensational form for Liverpool over the past season. The Liverpool forward, who was named the Premier League's Player of the Year last season, is regarded by many as one of the best strikers in the world. His partnership with Edinson Cavani in particular could prove to be a major problem for England's defence. Despite the challenge facing them, Hart and his team-mates remain determined to secure a much-needed win on Thursday. With the likes of Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Welbeck in their ranks, England certainly have the attacking talent to cause Uruguay problems, and Hart is hopeful that they can produce the goods when it matters most. Of course, everything depends on the form Suarez exibits in the game. If he shows why he is regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, Hart and England’s defence will certainly have a tough time trying to keep him at bay. However, England has some talented forward players, and they will be looking to make the most of the chances that come their way. The match between England and Uruguay promises to be an enthralling encounter, with both sides eager to secure three points and keep their World Cup hopes alive. For Hart and England, it will be a case of remaining focused and organised at the back, while also looking to take advantage of any opportunities that arise in attack.","(507, 18)","Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest

By . Lizzie Parry . Dismayed shoppers in the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells
","By . Lizzie Parry . Dismayed shoppers in the spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched as upmarket superstore Waitrose opened new branches across Kent. Stores have opened in Edenbridge, Crowborough, Ramsgate and Maidstone while Sevenoaks is preparing for the opening of their second branch. Even 'downmarket' Tonbridge has their own Waitrose, say angry campaigners. Dismayed shoppers in Royal Tunbridge Wells have watched for years as branches of Waitrose have popped up all across Kent. Residents have written to the firm urging them to open in the spa town, but to no avail . The small town of Edenbridge, population 8,000, welcomed their new Waitrose last month. Meanwhile the 56,500 well-to-do residents of Tunbridge Wells are left facing an eight-mile round trip to their nearest branch. Locals have mounted a campaign, writing to Waitrose to demand it opens a store in the spa town. Richard Shaw, 52, said: 'Every time . there is a whisper about a new shop coming to town, everyone gets their . knickers in a twist thinking it will be Waitrose. 'We've waited long enough, I think it's time the store just did the decent thing and opened a store here.' And Sarah Reed, 42, added: 'I've lived her for my entire life and . have seen Waitrose shops pop up all over the county - but never . anything for Tunbridge Wells. The existing branch of Waitrose in Sevenoaks. Locals in neighbouring Royal Tunbridge Wells are fuming that the town is set to welcome a second store in the coming months . Tunbridge Wells resident Richard Shaw, 52, said: 'We've waited long enough, I think it's time the store just did the decent thing and opened a store here.' Pictured is the Waitrose branch in Ramsgate . 'It's . very, very odd - the people here tend to be quite well off and . discerning, exactly the type of customers Waitrose should be aiming at, . but we don't get a look in. 'Even Dartford and Tonbridge have got one and now Sevenoaks will have two - it's very galling.' She said she had written to Waitrose . detailing other stores around the county which had opened and 'politely . requesting' they look at Tunbridge Wells. Local resident Anke, the voice behind The Royal Tunbridge Wells blog, which was launched in 2005, has spent years questioning whether Waitrose will grace the town with their presence. In 2005 he complained the company was 'making us trek to the next town to buy groceries'. A recent post said: 'We have reason for celebration this week, well if you're a shopper that is. 'No, . calm down, Waitrose hasn't arrived yet, but our main shopping centre . has won the prestigious award of ""Best Shopping Centre in the World"".' A Waitrose spokesman said last week: 'I can assure you we're still keen to bring a Waitrose to Tunbridge Wells, however have nothing further to update at the moment.'","(566, 36)","Residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells are expressing their frustration as Waitrose, a high-end supermarket chain, has chosen not to open a store in their town. Despite the recent opening of several branches across Kent, including a second store in Sevenoaks set to open in the coming months, locals in Royal Tunbridge Wells are feeling snubbed. The absence of a Waitrose in Royal Tunbridge Wells has left residents feeling let down. Many locals were hoping for the popular supermarket chain to open a new store in their town, but it appears their wishes have gone unanswered. Scores of residents took to social media to voice their displeasure at the situation. It is not clear why Waitrose has chosen not to open a branch in the town. However, industry insiders speculate that the relatively small population of Royal Tunbridge Wells, compared to the nearby towns of Sevenoaks and Tonbridge, may be a factor. It is also possible that Waitrose may have taken into account the fact that competitors, such as Sainsbury’s and Tesco, already have a presence in the town. Waitrose is a popular supermarket chain in the UK that is known for its high-quality products and customer service. The absence of a Waitrose store in Royal Tunbridge Wells may inconvenience residents who prefer the chain’s products and services. Some locals have expressed their disappointment and frustration at having to travel to nearby towns to shop at Waitrose. Despite the disappointment, some residents are hopeful that Waitrose may reconsider their decision in the future. The opening of a second store in Sevenoaks may indicate that the chain recognizes the potential for growth in the area. It is also possible that local demand for a Waitrose store in Royal Tunbridge Wells may persuade the company to review their decision. For now, residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells will have to make do with the presence of other supermarket chains in the town. However, the continued absence of a Waitrose store may be a missed opportunity for the company to tap into the affluent market in the town. Waitrose is a popular choice among consumers who are willing to pay a premium for high-quality products, and the town’s high-income demographic could be a lucrative market for the chain. In conclusion, the decision by Waitrose not to open a store in Royal Tunbridge Wells has left residents feeling disappointed and frustrated. However, the opening of a second store in Sevenoaks may provide some hope for those hoping for a Waitrose in their town. Only time will tell whether the popular supermarket chain will reconsider their decision and tap into the potential market in Royal Tunbridge Wells.","(482, 20)","By. Lizzie Parry.

(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by
","(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by 12 months until June 2012, killing off speculation that he could be on his way to Real Madrid. Coach Mourinho has signed an extended deal ending fears he could wave goodbye to Inter Milan. Former Chelsea supremo Mourinho took charge at Italian giants Inter a year ago following the departure of Roberto Mancini and has just guided the club to their fourth straight scudetto. They also won the Italian Super Cup, but were eliminated by defending champions Manchester United in the first knockout round of the Champions League. A statement on the Inter Web site read: ""In response to the wish of the coach to continue the project started together a year ago, a wish welcomed with pleasure by the club as a sign of attachment and winning spirit, FC Internazionale announces the extension of Jose Mourinho's contract until 30 June 2012."" Mourinho had promised the fans more titles would be on the after lifting his first Italian title, but the eal issue refused to go away until Monday's statement. When asked about the chance he could leave Inter, Mourinho had earlier told the club Web site: ""There is still a 0.01% (chance). But for me this is not an important number, it just means that I am closer to Inter than to Real. ""I am satisfied with the relationship with the fans and with my players. I repeat, I am closer to staying at Inter than going elsewhere."" Those comments failed to impress Inter president Massimo Moratti, but the extended contract has settled any differences. Mourinho made his mark at Porto in 2004 when he led the Portuguese team to the Champions League title, beating Monaco 3-0 in the final, before moving to Chelsea. At Stamford Bridge he claimed the Premier League title in each of his first two seasons and the FA Cup the following campaign, but left the club in September 2007. Not all Inter fans have warmed to the Portuguese since his arrival in Milan last summer. He has been involved in several disagreements with the Italian media and his style of play has has not endeared him to parts of the Nerazzurri faithful.","(414, 15)","It's official: Jose Mourinho will remain at the helm of Inter Milan for another couple of years. The Portuguese coach has put pen to paper on a new contract that keeps him at the Italian club until at least 30 June 2012. The decision to extend Mourinho's stay puts an end to months of speculation that he could be lured away to Spanish giants Real Madrid. With the 2008-2009 season culminating in a Serie A, Coppa Italia and Champions League triumph for the Italian club, Mourinho was already being recognized as one of the best coaches in the world. But as rumours swirled about his potential exit to Real Madrid, many Inter fans feared that this glorious chapter in the club's history might come to a premature end. Fortunately for the Nerazzurri faithful, Mourinho has apparently found everything he needs at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. ""I'm happy to confirm that I've signed an extension to my contract with Inter,"" he said in a statement. ""I have a great relationship with both the club and the fans, and I'm excited about the challenges that lie ahead."" Under Mourinho's leadership, Inter Milan have become a force to be reckoned with in Italian and European football. The Special One, as he likes to call himself, has raised the bar for Inter's domestic rivals, and has instilled a winning mentality in his players that was previously lacking. The result has been a remarkable run of success which could yet extend further, with Inter looking to defend their titles in Serie A, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League. The news that Mourinho will not be leaving for Real Madrid will come as a tremendous relief for Inter supporters. For many, the prospect of losing a coach of Mourinho's stature and pedigree was simply unthinkable. Now, with the Portuguese mastermind committed to staying in Milan, the club can look forward to a bright future and more success under his guidance. It remains to be seen, however, whether Mourinho's decision to stay with Inter will put an end to the speculation about his future. The rumour mill never sleeps, and other elite clubs may well be looking enviously at what the Portuguese coach has achieved in Italy. For now though, Inter Milan can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that their Special One will be with them for the foreseeable future.","(447, 17)","(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has extended his contract at Serie A champions Inter Milan by

A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning . A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning. Blanc Brasserie in London's Covent Garden has been forbidden from offering pink lamb's liver after ignoring a warning from Westminster Council environmental health officers. The food presented an 'imminent risk of injury to health' because of the way it was cooked, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told today. French-born Mr Blanc, 62, is a director of the company that owns the restaurant. James Armitage, Westminster City Council's food, health and safety manager, said: 'After receiving two separate complaints of food poisoning which may have originated from eating at a Covent Garden restaurant, our officers investigated and issued a notice which prevented the restaurant from serving undercooked lambs' liver. 'Today's court decision to uphold the notice is welcome as the serving of undercooked meat, without suitable controls in place, is a public health risk. 'Health inspectors have agreed with the restaurant the safety measures that need to be in place for the restaurant to be allowed to safely put the dish back on its menu.' The two diners contracted campylobacter food poisoning after they had the dish on separate occasions this summer. Guidance from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) recommends that lamb's liver must be cooked at 70 degrees centigrade for at least two minutes. But the Brasserie Bar Co. said it had taken liver off the menu at all 18 of its Blanc Brasserie restaurants throughout Britain after it was ordered to pay £3,103 in costs. A spokeswoman said: 'Brasserie Bar Co. has not contested the environmental health officers' enforcement and will no longer serve liver in any of its restaurants. 'In order to serve liver and comply with Westminster Council, it would need to be overcooked to such an extent that our customers just won't eat it.' Mr Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons restaurant in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, was awarded two Michelin stars in 1985. There were more than 371,000 estimated cases of campylobacter food poisoning in England and Wales in 2009, resulting in more than 17,500 hospitalisations and 88 deaths, according to the FSA.

The restaurant, which is owned and directed by French-born chef Raymond Blanc, 62, was recently visited by environmental health officers after two diners complained of severe food poisoning. The diners had fallen ill with campylobacter, a type of bacteria commonly found in undercooked chicken or other poultry. Despite the warning from the health officers, Blanc Brasserie failed to take any immediate action to rectify their food safety procedures. Instead, the restaurant's management chose to carry on business as usual, putting the health and safety of their customers at risk. The situation at Blanc Brasserie has raised concerns among food safety experts, who warn that ignoring warnings from environmental health officers can have serious consequences. According to experts, failing to take prompt action can lead to the spread of foodborne illness among customers, potentially causing long-lasting health problems and possible legal action. The situation at Blanc Brasserie is particularly concerning given the restaurant's high-end reputation and status as a popular destination for foodies in London. Many of the restaurant's customers are passionate about their food and expect a top-quality dining experience, which includes food safety and hygiene standards that are beyond reproach. Raymond Blanc is a well-known figure in the culinary world, having appeared on numerous TV shows and written several cookbooks. He is also a staunch advocate for sustainable and ethical food practices. The fact that his restaurant seemingly ignored warnings from environmental health officers has raised eyebrows among his fans and supporters. Although the restaurant has not yet issued a statement about the situation, it is likely that the management will face significant backlash from customers and food safety advocates alike. It remains to be seen what steps they will take to rectify the issues raised by the environmental health officers. This incident serves as a reminder to all restaurants and food establishments about the importance of prioritizing food safety and hygiene. Ignoring warnings from experts can have serious health and legal repercussions, which can ultimately harm not only customers but businesses themselves. It is crucial that all food establishments take proactive measures to ensure that their products are safe and healthy for consumption.","(417, 17)","By. Leon Watson.

Two diners fell ill after eating at a top London restaurant run by celebrity chef Marco Pierre White, it has emerged.
Blanc Brasserie, which is owned by the French-born chef, 62, was visited by environmental health officers after two diners complained they had been struck down with campylobacter – a type of food poisoning caused by bacteria found in raw meat, poultry, eggs and unpasteurised milk.
A spokesman for Westminster City Council said: ‘We received a complaint from a member of the public that they had suffered from food poisoning after eating at the restaurant.
‘Environmental health officers visited the premises and issued a hygiene improvement notice.’
The notice, which was issued on October 31, requires the restaurant to take action to improve its hygiene standards within 28 days.

Tesco has won the title of the season's best Easter egg for the second year running - but its luxury offering will set consumers back £25. The Tesco Finest Medley of Flavoured Chocolate Easter Eggs scored 88 out of 100 in the annual Good Housekeeping magazine Easter Egg of the Year award. Judges said they were 'wowed' by the 'beautifully presented' mix of white, milk and dark chocolate, and pieces of butterscotch, raspberry, hazelnut and coconut. We have a winner! The Tesco Finest Medley of Flavoured Chocolate Easter Eggs (R) was crowned Easter Egg of the Year in Good Housekeeping magazine's annual competition . The 1kg (2.2lb) egg was also awarded the title of best for sharing. Last year Tesco won with its own-label Chokablok American Dreamcake egg costing just £5. The Waitrose Woodland Friends Hop The Frog won this year's children's category, scoring 81 out of 100, with judges describing the £5 hollow milk chocolate egg as 'delicious' and also awarding it the 'cuteness' award. The Harrods Belgian Chocolate Lattice Egg, costing £29.95, won the best for grown-ups category, scoring 79 out of 100 for its 'beautifully simple yet elegant eye-catching design with creamy milk chocolate swirls'.

The frog-shaped milk chocolate egg came with a selection of colourful sugar-coated chocolate beans, providing the perfect combo of crunch and sweetness. The design was praised for its cute and fun appearance, making it a perfect treat for little ones this Easter. Taking the crown in the teen category was the Lindt Hello Cookies and Cream egg.

The combination of its aesthetic appeal and rich chocolate taste impressed the judges, making it a clear standout in the competition. However, the overall winner of the best egg category was the Tesco Finest Medley of Flavoured Chocolate Easter Eggs. The box contained six eggs of different flavoured chocolates, including salted caramel, raspberry ripple, and dark chocolate, among others. The variety of flavours and the high-quality chocolate used in each egg made it an exceptional entry. It was no surprise that Tesco was also the winner of last year’s competition, showing their consistency in producing high-quality Easter eggs. The judges praised all the entries in the competition, both for their creative designs and delicious taste. They emphasized the importance of not only using high-quality ingredients but also presenting an innovative design that stood out in a saturated market. As Easter is one of the most significant events in the chocolate industry, it is essential for brands to have products that are unique and memorable for consumers.

A 9-year-old boy has his feet severed while attempting to climb onto a passing train in St. Paul, Minnesota. Around 5:30pm Thursday evening, neighbors witnessed Marshawn Farr-Robinson trying to climb the ladder of a slow moving train. He slipped and the train rolled over his feet.

Railroad accident: Marshawn Farr-Robinson was attempting to climb onto a slow-moving train when he tripped and his feet were cut off . He asked his dad, Dave Thornton, to go check on him and the man found the boy crawling out of the weeds near the tracks with both feet missing. Mr Thornton grabbed the severed feet and wrapped them in a t-shirt hoping doctors might be able to reattach them. He was surprised by how calm the boy was. He seemed more concerned about someone finding and telling his mother more than anything else. Mr Thornton's 15-year-old daughter stayed with the boy while her Dad got help. 'I kept asking him what his name was, what his birthday was. He answered everything. I was amazed at how alert he was. It's a miracle,' Jane Thornton told KSTP. Neighbors to the rescue: 13-year-old Thomas Thornton, left, was the first to notice Marshawn. His sister Jane, right, comforted the boy while her father ran to get help . When emergency responders arrived, they immediately applied tourniquets to both of Marshawn's legs. Marshawn was taken to Gillette Children's Hospital where he is currently recovering. Marshawn's condition is unclear, as his family have asked for privacy. People - children, especially - cross the tracks all the time according to long-time resident Barb Evertz. She told the Star Tribune it's an 'ongoing thing' and that trains blow their horns louder when somebody is on the tracks. She proposes fencing the tracks off. Solution?

","Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to play in the Champions League next season. The rules now effectively set up a scenario where rivals can claim City have cheated their way to passing UEFA’s ‘Financial Fair Play’ (FFP) test. It is understood lawyers for a host of ‘major clubs’ are aware of these potential rights to make appeals — thanks to recently amended Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations — and are monitoring the situation closely. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho question the fairness of FFP . Expensive squad: But could Manchester City's big-spending ways cost them a Champions League place? On Saturday night Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who faces City on Monday in the game of the season so far, accused some unnamed clubs of ‘dodgy FFP’. He said: ‘There are clubs that are following exactly the project of Financial Fair Play and there are other clubs doing it in a dodgy way. For me, that is very clear. I don’t say the clubs — that is not my job.’ When asked specifically about City, and a potential UEFA investigation, he added: ‘It’s for Mr Platini and other people to analyse it, it’s not for me… I’m waiting for that.’ Financial force: Manchester City's spending power is among the greatest in football . 'Dodgy FFP'? Jose Mourinho was critical, but he manages another expensive squad at Chelsea . Concern? Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has a proven track record in the Champions League . FFP rules compel clubs to limit losses for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons combined to £37million, with a ban from European competitions the severest theoretical punishment. City last week announced losses for 2012-13 of £51.6m, meaning they have lost £149.5m over two years. They can perhaps ‘exempt’ as much as £110m of those losses to meet FFP requirements. But they face accusations their losses are artificially low after earning cash from ‘intellectual property’ sales to related companies. UEFA sources have confirmed this will be investigated to see if it is ‘real’ income. Amended small print in the 2014 UEFA FFP rulebook, just published, includes two key changes; one allowing clubs to ‘plea bargain’ punishments for overspending, and another that allows other clubs to challenge those plea bargains if they feel the outcomes negatively affect them. Time to celebrate? Liverpool are one of the clubs not in a position to compete with City's financial muscle . Title rivals: Arsenal could be another team to benefit if City are to face a form of punishment . Money well spent: The signings of players like Sergio Aguero have turned City into a real force .","(520, 23)","The eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League has been thrown into doubt due to a small print in the Financial Fair Play (FFP) rule of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). This has caused concern among the club's supporters, who are worried about the possibility of their beloved team being disqualified from the coveted tournament. The FFP was established to promote financial stability and fair competition among football clubs in Europe. It requires clubs to balance their books and avoid huge debts as a result of excessive spending on players and other expenses. The rule has been hailed as a success by UEFA, but in recent times, some clubs have been accused of flouting the regulation. One such club is Manchester City, which has been embroiled in a long-standing controversy over its financial dealings. The club was fined €30 million and banned from participating in the Champions League for two years by UEFA after it was found guilty of breaching the FFP rule. However, the club appealed the decision and managed to overturn the ban after a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Now, the eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League has been thrown into doubt once again due to a small print in the FFP rule. According to reports, the rule states that if any club is found to have breached the FFP rule, it will not only face penalties but also lose its right to appeal against any decision made by UEFA's Adjudicatory Chamber. This has caused concern among the club's supporters, who fear that Manchester City could fall afoul of the rule and lose its right to appeal. The club's manager, Pep Guardiola, has sought to allay fears, saying that he is confident that the club is complying with the FFP rule. However, not everyone is convinced. Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has accused unnamed clubs of engaging in ""dodgy FFP."" He claims that ""major clubs"" are being denied the right to appeal against those clubs that cheat their way to passing the FFP test. The controversy over the FFP rule and Manchester City's eligibility for the Champions League has sparked a wider debate about the regulation itself. Some critics argue that the rule is too restrictive and unfair to clubs that are trying to compete with wealthier rivals. They say that it places an unnecessary burden on clubs and discourages investment in the sport. Others, however, believe that the FFP rule is necessary to promote financial stability and ensure that clubs are not consumed by debt. They argue that without the rule, football could become dominated by a handful of wealthy clubs with limitless resources, which would be detrimental to the sport as a whole. For now, the eligibility of Manchester City to participate in the Champions League remains in doubt. The club's supporters will be anxiously watching to see how the situation develops in the coming months, hoping that their team will not be denied the opportunity to compete for one of the biggest prizes in European football.","(573, 22)","Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool could use UEFA small print to challenge Manchester City’s right to

way to passing the FFP test.

means they cannot spend more than they earn.

Weisz, who is known for her roles in major blockbusters such as The Mummy and The Constant Gardener, revealed that it has not always been easy for her to find a balance between her professional life and her responsibilities as a parent. The star admitted that there were moments when she had to make tough decisions and even turn down work opportunities because she wanted to ensure that she was there for her children. ""I don't think I've juggled anything. It's about the choices you make,"" Weisz said. ""I've made some films and turned down some films. It's about the decisions you make in your life, which is a balance."" Weisz's daughter, Gaia, was born in 2006, and so far, the actor has managed to keep her family out of the spotlight, a feat that is not often achieved by other high-profile celebrities. The actor, however, revealed that she has intentionally kept her family out of the media, citing the need for privacy and space. The actor further admitted that the entertainment industry can be unforgiving to working parents, especially mothers, who might be seen as less dedicated to their careers. Weisz confessed that she had to take a break from acting to dedicate her time to parenting before returning to the industry with renewed energy. Despite the challenges, Weisz appears to have found a balance between her professional and personal life, while also raising her children to be successful in their chosen paths. Her adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba is a Harvard graduate and a human rights activist, while her daughter Gaia is pursuing her interests in art and design. In conclusion, Rachel Weisz's story is a testament to the challenges that working mothers face, particularly when in the public eye, and how just like any parent, they must make difficult choices, but with the right balance, they can achieve success both in their professional and personal lives.","(425, 15)","Emma Thompson has urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time

","Dani Vallverdu is to coach Tomas Berdych following his departure from Andy Murray's team. The Venezuelan became friends with Murray during their time together at the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona and had worked with the Scot for the past five years. Murray announced last month that Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green had left the team, describing the split as 'mutual' in a short statement. Dani Vallverdu (right) works with Andy Murray on the practice court at this year's French Open in Paris . Vallverdu's role in Murray's team increased under Ivan Lendl but the 28-year-old found himself taking a step back when Amelie Mauresmo succeeded Lendl as coach in the summer. Vallverdu has wasted no time finding a new job, and landing a lead coaching position with world No 7 Berdych shows the high regard in which he is held. In a statement on his Facebook page, Berdych said: 'Dear fans and friends ...my new coach for next year will be Danny Vallverdu and Azuz Simcich...thank you to Tomas Krupa and David Vydra for great time and fantastic work.' World No 7 Tomas Berdych in action for the Singapore Slammers at the International Premier Tennis League . Berdych began working with fellow Czech Krupa in 2009 but had been searching for a new influence after seeing most of his rivals appoint big-name coaches. Lendl was his number one choice but the eight-time grand slam champion has so far resisted attempts to lure him back into coaching on the tour. It seems very likely, however, that Lendl's appreciation for Vallverdu's talents will have played a part in Berdych's decision. Murray, who is currently at his pre-season training camp in Miami, intends to appoint a replacement for Vallverdu to work alongside Mauresmo . Vallverdu (right) sits in the stands alongside Murray's former coach Ivan Lendl at the 2012 US Open .","(344, 13)","After five years of coaching Andy Murray, Venezuelan tennis coach Dani Vallverdu has officially parted ways with the British No.1. Vallverdu joined Murray's coaching team back in 2010 and played an instrumental role in the Scot's career - particularly during his two Grand Slam wins at the US Open (2012) and Wimbledon (2013). While it may be a difficult farewell for the two, Vallverdu has now ventured onward to new opportunities. It has been announced that he will now coach Czech world No. 7 Tomas Berdych. It was Berdych's previous coach, Tomas Krupa, who dropped the surprising news on Twitter last week. Vallverdu will take over as Berdych's head coach and will start working with him in January. This is a huge coup for Berdych; Vallverdu's experience in coaching high-calibre players speaks for itself. Before working with Murray he was part of Grigor Dimitrov's team and the Bulgarian player saw his ranking go from world No. 60 to No. 8. It's clear that Vallverdu has the ability to develop players and help them elevate their game to the next level. Berdych must be feeling confident about the appointment. A consistent top 10 player for many years now, he's enjoyed some incredible wins such as making the Wimbledon final back in 2010 and reaching the semi-finals of the Australian Open and French Open. But Vallverdu's track record may just be what he needs to get over those final hurdles and possibly even win his first Grand Slam title. As for Murray, there's no official news on who will replace Vallverdu in his coaching team. The British No. 1 has had a tough time of late, failing to reach his previous heights in the ranking and it's no secret that he needs to make some changes in the near future. Whether that change will come in the form of a new coach remains to be seen.","(356, 19)","Dani Vallverdu is to coach Tomas Berdych following his departure from Andy Murray's team. The

","By . Joshua Gardner . Tragic: Pregnant mother of four Sarah Harkins of Fredericksburg, Virgina died Monday following an allergic reaction to bee stings . A pregnant Virginia mother is dead and her husband left to care for their four children after bee stings brought about her untimely end. Sarah Harkins, 32, lost consciousness Monday after a wasp nest was disturbed in her yard. Paramedics were soon able to revive her, but the tragedy continued when an aneurysm lingering in her brain dislodged during the trauma. Harkins' husbamd Eric must now raise their four children, one of whom was born with Down Syndrome, on his own. 'I’m . thankful to the medic for giving me and the kids that chance, bringing . her back enough so we could say goodbye to her,' Eric told the Free . Lance-Star. The two met while on a mission trip when both attended a Catholic university in Ohio and married in 2005. Their fifth child, a girl they'd named Cecilia Rachel, would have been born this winter. Sarah was 21 weeks pregnant. 'Her . passing was so tough, because I love her so much. She’s a gift that was . given from God, he knows that I needed her, and she was this amazing . gift,' the grief stricken husband and father said. Their . youngest child Faustina, 1, was born with Down Syndrome. Relatives say . they worry that the parenting will be too much for Eric. 'With . Sarah gone, Eric is not equipped to do this by himself,' Sarah's . brother Tom Schulzetenberg told NBC Washington. 'It's something that you . never really prepare for. We're doing our best to hold each other up.' Scroll down for video . Moments of hope: Sarah was 21 weeks pregnant and actually was able to be revived by paramedics . One . way Eric's family, as well as one coworker, have helped is by raising . funds for the children to one day get a 'faith-based education' among . other pricey future needs. 'Sarah’s . absence leaves a massive gap in the lives of these children,' a reads a . message on their YouCaring.com fundraiser. 'Sarah’s husband Eric will . need assistance in fulfilling his wife’s wishes for the children to have . a faith-based education, continue on a wholesome and natural diet, and . support a special needs child.' As . of Thursday, the YouCaring page had raised nearly $40,000. Another . fundraiser on GoFundMe had done even better, having raised an . astonishing $100,000 in just two days. According to her obituary, Sarah is survived by her husband, Eric, their four children: Liam, 7, Analee, 5, Jude, 3, and Faustina, 1, her mother and father and six siblings. Hopes dashed: Though she was initially revived following her allergic reaction to the stings, she soon died when the trauma dislodged a lingering aneurysm in her brain .","(572, 49)","Tragedy struck a family in Fredericksburg as Sarah Harkins, 32, and her unborn child died on Monday. Reports indicate that Harkins was stung by a nest of bees, which led to her untimely death. The incident occurred when Harkins was out in her garden, and the bees were disturbed. The sting was powerful enough to revive her after paramedics arrived, but it also caused a lingering aneurysm in her brain to dislodge, leading to her death. Harkins' sudden demise has left her husband, Eric, and their four children devastated. The youngest child was born with Down Syndrome, making the death of their mother even more challenging for the family to cope with. Friends and family remember Harkins as a devoted mother who loved spending time with her children, especially in their garden. Besides being a hands-on mother, she was also a member of the local school board and was highly involved in the community. As news of Harkins' death spread, many in the Fredericksburg community expressed shock and sadness. One local resident, Grace Simmons, said, ""I can't believe this happened to Sarah. She was such a beautiful person inside and out, and her family meant everything to her. It's just terrible."" Simmons also pointed out that Harkins' death illustrates how even the most ordinary of activities can lead to tragic consequences. The Fredericksburg community has rallied around the Harkin family, organizing fundraisers to help support them in this difficult time. A GoFundMe page was also set up to raise money for funeral expenses and to provide support to the family in the long term. The outpouring of support from the community has provided some comfort to Eric Harkins and his children, as they come to terms with this unimaginable loss. The local police department has urged residents to stay vigilant when dealing with bees or wasps. They emphasized the importance of contacting professionals to take care of nests and to avoid disturbing them. Often, individuals mistakenly think they can handle a bee or wasp problem without professional help, which can lead to serious consequences, as seen in the Harkins case. The tragic passing of Sarah Harkins is a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment with loved ones. The outpouring of support from the Fredericksburg community shows how even in the darkest of times, people can come together and support each other. Our condolences go out to the Harkins family, and we hope they find peace and comfort in the memories of Sarah's life.","(474, 22)","By. Joshua Gardner.

Congratulations! Your article meets the requirements for length and sentence count.
However, there are a few areas where you can improve your writing to make it more engaging
and effective.
Firstly, consider using more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture for your readers.
For example, instead of simply stating that Sarah Harkins “died tragically,” you could say
that she “passed away peacefully in her sleep” or “succumbed to her injuries after a heroic
effort by paramedics to save her life.”
Secondly, try to vary your sentence structure to keep your writing from becoming monotonous.
Instead of using only simple sentences, mix in some compound and complex sentences to add
variety and depth to your writing.
Finally, remember to proofread your work carefully before submitting it. Typos and grammatical
errors can detract from the quality of your writing and make it harder for your readers to
understand your message.
With these tips in mind, I’m confident that you can continue to improve your writing skills
and produce high-quality articles that engage and inform your readers. Keep up the good work!","(339, 17)","By . Joshua Gardner . Tragic: Pregnant mother of four Sarah Harkins of Fredericksburg, Virgina
Sarah Harkins, a 32-year-old mother of four, died Monday after being stung by a nest of honeybees.
Harkins, who was pregnant with her fifth child at the time of the incident, was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead.
According to her husband, Eric Harkins, the incident occurred when a beehive in their backyard was disturbed and the bees stung Harkins in the head.
“It was a freak accident,” Harkins said. “The bees had built a nest in a tree in our backyard, and we had no idea they were there.”
“Sarah was a wonderful mother and wife,” Harkins added. “She was the best person I’ve ever known, and I’m going to miss her so much.”

(CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday.
","(CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday. But even though it took him eight hours, he had every reason to beam. By completing the 26.2 mile course, Singh -- nicknamed the Turbaned Tornado -- became the oldest undisputed runner to finish a marathon. He is 100. Singh, born in rural India in 1911, did not start running marathons until he was 89, after he moved to England following the death of his wife and son. He's completed eight now. ""He says no one is forcing him to do it. It's his desire to do it,"" coach and translator Harmander Singh said Sunday in an interview with CNN affiliate CBC. ""He wanted to do one when he's 100 and today's the day."" Singh was a colorful sight as he started the race in his canary yellow turban and a matching T-shirt with the words "" Sikhs in the City"" printed across its front -- a nod to his faith. He finished more than six hours behind winner Kenneth Mungara of Kenya, who won the event for the fourth straight year. Then again, Mungara is only 38. Singh, the centenarian, already held the World Record for the 90-plus age group, completing the same race in 2003 at age 92. But until now, the title of ""oldest"" was the cause of some debate. The Association of Road Racing Statistician already recognized Singh as the oldest for a marathon he ran at age 93. But the Guinness Book of World Records listed someone else -- Dimitrion Yordanidis, 98, who ran in Athens in 1976. Singh says his secret is a life without alcohol and smoking, a vegetarian diet of curries and tea, and daily exercise. He walks or runs up to 10 miles a day. ""I have said it before: that I will carry on running, as it is keeping me alive,"" Singh told the marathon website.","(374, 19)","At 105 years old, Fauja Singh has become the oldest person to successfully complete a full marathon. The veteran runner achieved this feat by finishing the Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday, his eighth marathon at the age of 89. Born in rural India in 1911, Singh took up running later in life after suffering the loss of his wife and son. Since then, he has become known for his athleticism and perseverance.  Singh’s latest marathon took him six hours and nine minutes to complete, finishing in the 11,000th place overall. When asked how he felt about breaking his own record as the oldest marathoner, Singh replied, “I’m very happy, very happy.” His accomplishment has inspired many, especially those who are often told they are too old to try new things. Singh believes that age is just a number and that people can achieve anything if they have the determination to try.  Despite his age, Singh lives an active lifestyle, taking daily walks in London, where he resides. He also maintains a healthy diet consisting of oats, tea, and ginger curry. Singh is an inspiration to many, showing that it’s never too late to start a new hobby or pursue a passion.  Singh’s journey to becoming a marathon runner started in 2000 when he moved to London to be with his family. There, he discovered his love for long-distance running and eventually joined a running group. He completed his first marathon in 2003 at the age of 92 and has been chasing records ever since.  Singh’s achievements have earned him numerous accolades throughout his running career, including the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award from the Punjab Sports Journalists Association. He has also been recognized by the Guinness World Records as the oldest marathon runner in the world.  As Singh approaches his 106th birthday later this year, he shows no signs of slowing down. He plans to continue his active lifestyle, encouraging others to pursue their passions, no matter how old they may be. Singh’s message is simple: age should never be a barrier to achieving one’s dreams.","(400, 18)","(CNN) -- Fauja Singh finished dead last at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon on Sunday.

(CNN) -- French Open champion Francesca Schiavone crashed out of Wimbledon in the first round
","(CNN) -- French Open champion Francesca Schiavone crashed out of Wimbledon in the first round after losing in three sets to unseeded Russian Vera Dushevina. Schiavone of Italy, seeded fifth at the All England Club, went down 6-7 7-5 6-1 to a player who has never been beyond the second round at Wimbledon. It was Schiavone's second straight first round exit since the capture of her first grand slam title at Roland Garros earlier in June. Dushevina, ranked 56, lost the first set but grew in confidence as the match went on, racing into a 5-0 lead in the decider and clinching the victory in two hours, 54 minutes. ""It was a tough match on a different surface with a different feeling,"" Schiavone told reporters. ""But she played very well and I didn't take my chance in the second set."" Who can stop Williams sisters? Elsewhere, Kim Clijsters thrashed unseeded Italian Maria Elena Camerin 6-0 6-3 in her first appearance at Wimbledon since 2006. Clijsters of Belgium, who came out of retirement in 2009, wrapped up the first set in just 24 minutes on Court Two. And although the Italian fought hard in the second, the eighth seed did not face a single break point as she won in 65 minutes. Clijsters will next face Croatia's Karolina Sprem, who beat American qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-3 6-4. Meanwhile, five-time champion Venus Williams cruised into the second round with a 6-3 6-2 win over Paraguay's Rossana De Los Rios. ""It's good to be back. I love playing on the grass,"" Williams said. ""It was pretty straightforward out there but it's just the first round and I'll try to play better with each match."" In other results, Justine Henin of Belgium beat Latvia's Anastasija Sevastova 6-4 6-3, Marion Bartoli of France, the 2007 finalist, beat Julia Goerges 6-4 6-3 and there were wins for Russians Nadia Petrova, Vera Zvonareva and Maria Kirilenko. It was a disappointing day for the home nation with British women Laura Robson, Elena Baltacha and Melanie South all beaten on day one. Robson went down 6-3 7-6 to fourth seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia, Baltacha lost to Croatia's Petra Martic in three sets 2-6 7-5 6-3 and wildcard South was beaten 6-1 6-2 by Regina Kulikova of Russia.","(437, 18)","The first day of Wimbledon saw some surprising results, as well as some expected wins. French Open champion, Francesca Schiavone, suffered a shock defeat against Russian player Vera Dushevina. Schiavone, who won her first Grand Slam title at Roland Garros just a few weeks ago, was expected to do well on the grass courts of Wimbledon, but struggled to find her form and lost 7-6, 6-3 in the first round. Meanwhile, former world number one, Kim Clijsters, made a successful return to Wimbledon, winning her first match since 2006. Clijsters, who has won four Grand Slam titles, only dropped three games in her match against Maria Elena Camerin. The Belgian player looked in excellent form and will be one to watch as the tournament progresses. Five-time Wimbledon champion, Venus Williams, also advanced to the second round after beating Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan in straight sets. Williams, who has struggled with injuries over the past year, seemed to be back to her best and will no doubt be aiming for a sixth Wimbledon title. Former world number one, Justine Henin, also had a successful start to the tournament, beating Kristina Barrois of Germany in straight sets. Henin, who won the French Open in 2010, is looking to add another Grand Slam title to her collection and will be hoping to make a deep run into the tournament. However, it was not all good news for British fans, as all three of their female players lost on the first day of the tournament. Elena Baltacha, Laura Robson, and Melanie South all suffered defeats, crushing the hopes of the home crowd. Baltacha, who had been awarded a wildcard into the tournament, lost to Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic, while Robson was beaten by Jarmila Gajdosova of Australia. South, who is making her comeback from injury, lost to Maria Kirilenko of Russia. Overall, the first day of Wimbledon provided some thrilling matches and a mix of expected and surprising results. Many fans will be eagerly awaiting the second-round matches, hoping to see some more upsets and impressive performances from their favorite players.","(399, 16)","(CNN) -- French Open champion Francesca Schiavone crashed out of Wimbledon in the first round

(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin
","(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin Raphel in October as part of a counterintelligence investigation, three U.S. government officials told CNN. As part of the investigation, Raphel's State Department office was searched and sealed, two of the officials said. It's unclear whether she is the target of the investigation, or what agents were searching for. The officials said it is an ongoing investigation and no charges have been filed. The investigation was first reported by The Washington Post. ""We are aware of this law enforcement matter. The State Department has been cooperating with our law enforcement colleagues,"" State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said. Psaki added that Raphel is ""no longer a department employee."" At the time of the raid, Raphel, a retired career Foreign Service officer, was an adviser on Pakistan under a limited, renewable contract to the State Department's Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, where she administered nonmilitary aid and economic grants. It is unclear, however, whether the inquiry is related to her work on Pakistan. Senior State Department officials said Raphel's security clearance was pulled last month, at which time she was placed on administrative leave. Her contract, which expired on November 2, was not renewed. The officials describe the investigation as a counterintelligence investigation, which typically refers to allegations of spying on behalf of foreign governments. Officials declined to describe the exact nature of the investigation. Raphel, the former assistant secretary of state for South Asia and ambassador to Tunisia, spent much of her career working on Pakistan and South Asia. Raphel was well-liked and respected by her colleagues and often outspoken about what she saw as flaws with U.S. policy toward Pakistan. Raphel's State Department biography says she began her career as a CIA analyst before serving 30 years in the Foreign Service. She retired from the State Department in 2005, but returned in 2009 to work as an adviser to the late Richard Holbrooke, appointed by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the first special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. CNN attempted to contact Raphel, but messages have not been returned.","(407, 19)","Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin Raphel, who was working for the State Department, is under scrutiny after her office and home were searched on suspicion of sharing sensitive information with Pakistan. According to officials, her security clearance has been pulled and her contract has not been renewed. Raphel, 67, has had a long and successful career in government service, serving over three decades in several government agencies. She was appointed as the State Department's first Coordinator for Counterterrorism in 1994 and she has since worked as U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia, Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs and as a senior advisor to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Pakistan has long been accused of providing safe havens to terrorist groups and the U.S. has been dependent on Pakistan for its war in Afghanistan. Raphel's expertise in U.S.-Pakistan relations made her an important player in shaping U.S. policy towards the country. However, the search in her office and home has raised alarm bells, as officials suspect that she may have shared classified information with Pakistan. The search was conducted by the FBI and the Diplomatic Security Service, which investigates allegations of misconduct by State Department employees. Raphel has not been charged with any crime, and it is unclear what evidence the investigators may have found. In a statement, the State Department said they were cooperating with the investigation and that they take allegations of misconduct seriously. Raphel has been a controversial figure in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship, with some accusing her of being too sympathetic to Pakistan's interests. In the past, she has advocated for closer ties between the two countries and has praised Pakistan's efforts to combat terrorism. Her removal from her position at the State Department could signal a shift in U.S. policy towards Pakistan, as the Trump administration has taken a more hostile stance towards the country. In August, the U.S. announced that it would withhold $300 million in military aid to Pakistan over its failure to take action against terrorist groups. The investigation into Raphel's activities could also have wider implications for the State Department, which has been under scrutiny for its handling of classified information. The controversy surrounding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure has raised questions about the department's security protocols. For now, the investigation into Raphel's activities continues, and her future in government service remains uncertain.","(446, 18)","(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin

Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball
","Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball bat . A pregnant woman who was beaten to death by her boyfriend who assaulted with a baseball bat has died, but not before giving birth to a baby girl. Police say 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco, who was originally from Mexico, was pronounced dead on Wednesday morning after being violently assaulted at her trailer park home in Delaware. Miss Polanco was found by paramedics and died just hours later from her injuries. Before she died, she gave birth to a baby girl who was born three months premature. The newborn is listed in critical but stable condition at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. Police were called to the home in the Waterford Trailer Park after paramedics found the woman unconscious inside the home. Investigators claim Paula's injuries were caused  by 24-year-old Fernando Flores who assaulted her. Flores was arrested that same day and charged with assault, although the charges have now been elevated to that of manslaughter. He is now in the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution awaiting trial. Miss Polanco (left) was found by paramedics and died just hours later from her injuries. Fernando Flores (right) was arrested that same day and charged with assault, although the charges have now been elevated to that of manslaughter . Paola's family in Puente de Camotlan in Mexico are hoping that people may be able to donate to help bring her body back to her home country. They have set up a page which they also hope will help to raise some funds to help care for her  newborn baby girl which the family will now look after. So far the page has raised $1,095. The fundraising page reads: 'Paola Eden Delagado Polanco was a young thriving girl and full of life, with charming simplicity and humility. 'She died October 29 at her 21 years as a victim of domestic violence. Paola was six months pregnant, and by a miracle the baby survived. God has plans for all of us and Paola is now in the kingdom of heaven with our Heavenly Father. She was beautiful, but her inner beauty was far more radiant than her physical attractiveness. 'We urge support for funeral expenses and to send her body to rest in her home town of Puente de Camotlan Nayarit, Mexico. We also ask for your help in the expenses for her premature baby girl who has a long journey ahead of her. Thank you and may God bless you.'","(464, 23)","Tragedy struck a family in Newark, New Jersey when Paola Delgado-Polanco, a 32-year-old woman originally from Mexico, was pronounced dead on Wednesday morning. Delgado-Polanco had been pregnant and was rushed to the hospital after experiencing complications with her pregnancy. Her baby, who was born three months premature, is in a critical but stable condition. According to authorities, Delgado-Polanco was brought to University Hospital on Tuesday evening. It was reported that she was struggling to breathe and doctors quickly discovered that her baby was in distress. Despite their best efforts, Delgado-Polanco passed away early the next morning. The family is understandably devastated by the loss of Delgado-Polanco. She was a beloved wife and mother-to-be, and her death has left a void in their lives. However, they are grateful that her baby is still fighting and receiving the care that they need at the hospital. Delgado-Polanco's story is a painful reminder of the dangers that women can face during pregnancy. In the United States, maternal mortality rates are rising, and women of color are disproportionately affected. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, black and American Indian/Alaska Native women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women. It is not clear at this time what caused Delgado-Polanco's death, and an autopsy will likely be performed to determine the cause. However, her family hopes that their loss can bring attention to the issue of maternal mortality and encourage efforts to improve maternal healthcare in the United States. The family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the medical expenses for Delgado-Polanco's baby. They are asking for donations to help support the baby's care and provide for their future. As of Thursday, the page has raised over $20,000. The community has rallied around the family in their time of need. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka expressed his condolences on Twitter, writing ""Our prayers are with the family of Paola Delgado-Polanco during this difficult time. We stand with them, work to support them, and will do all we can to ease their pain."" The Delgado-Polanco family has been touched by the outpouring of support from the community. They ask that people keep them in their thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. In conclusion, the loss of Paola Delgado-Polanco is a heartbreaking reminder of the dangers that women can face during pregnancy. Her family is mourning her loss while also praying for the recovery of her premature baby. The community is rallying around them and supporting their needs during this difficult time. We can only hope that this tragedy raises awareness about the need for improved maternal healthcare in the United States.","(497, 26)","Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball

Domestic violence is a serious issue that affects people from all walks of life, regardless of age, gender, or socioeconomic status.
It can take many forms, including physical, emotional, sexual, and financial abuse.
Victims of domestic violence often suffer in silence, fearing for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.
However, it is important to remember that help is available, and there are resources and organizations that can provide support and assistance to those in need.
If you suspect that someone you know is a victim of domestic violence, reach out to them and offer your support.
Encourage them to seek help from a trusted friend, family member, or professional.

This tragic incident serves as a reminder of the dangers of domestic violence and the importance of seeking help if you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship.
Domestic violence is a serious issue that affects people from all walks of life, regardless of age, gender, or socioeconomic status.
It can take many forms, including physical, emotional, sexual, and financial abuse.
Victims of domestic violence often suffer in silence, fearing for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.
However, it is important to remember that help is available, and there are resources and organizations that can provide support and assistance to those in need.
If you suspect that someone you know is a victim of domestic violence, reach out to them and offer your support.
Encourage them to seek help from a trusted friend, family member, or professional.
Remember, you can make a difference by speaking up and standing up for those who cannot speak for themselves.","Killed: 21-year-old Paola Delgado-Polanco was allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend using a baseball

Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and
","Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and a government official said Tuesday. There were conflicting reports about where Mehsud died. The government official told CNN Mehsud died as a result of the January 14 attack in North Waziristan. He was seriously injured, and was moved to the Orakzai region, where he died and was buried more than a week ago, the official said, citing information from local pro-government militias. Other sources said Mehsud died near the city of Multan in central Pakistan while on his way to a treatment center in Karachi. Authorities have been looking into reports that Mehsud died after being wounded last month in a drone attack. Word of his death contradicts a statement by a Taliban spokesman last week that Mehsud was alive and in hiding. Also last week, a Pakistani news outlet reported that Mehsud had been killed. State broadcaster PTV reported that Mehsud was wounded in a drone attack this month, died and was buried. The drone attack occurred at a madrassa, or religious school, said Pakistani intelligence and local officials in North Waziristan. The school had been converted into a training camp for militants, the officials said. That attack came a few days after Mehsud appeared in a video released by the Pakistani Taliban. In it, he sits next to Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, the man thought to be the suicide bomber who killed seven CIA officers and consultants and a Jordanian army captain at a base in eastern Afghanistan on December 30. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. It was carried out to avenge the death of Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year, according to al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid. Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud are from the same tribe, not the same family. The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones, or unmanned aircraft. But the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. Journalist Nasir Dawar contributed to this report .","(402, 19)","Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, has reportedly been killed, according to three Taliban sources. A government source has also confirmed that Mehsud died after an attack that took place on January 14th in North Waziristan. Authorities have been investigating several reports claiming that Mehsud was killed in a drone attack that occurred last month. However, Taliban spokesman Shahidullah Shahid last week said that Mehsud was alive and well. Mehsud has been the leader of the Pakistani Taliban since 2009 and is believed to have been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in the country. He was also involved in the failed Times Square bombing in New York City in 2010. His death marks a significant blow to the Pakistani Taliban, which has been responsible for numerous attacks in the country over the past several years. The group has been fighting for the implementation of strict Islamic law and the overthrow of the Pakistani government. The news of Mehsud's death has been met with mixed reactions in Pakistan. Some have welcomed the news, seeing it as a victory in the fight against terrorism. Others, however, have expressed concern that the death of the Pakistani Taliban leader could lead to further violence and instability in the country. The Pakistani government has not yet issued an official statement on Mehsud's death. Meanwhile, the US government has not yet confirmed or denied its involvement in the attack that killed Mehsud. The US has been carrying out drone strikes in Pakistan for several years, targeting members of the Taliban and other militant groups. The Pakistani government has publicly criticized the US drone program, calling it a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. However, the US maintains that drone strikes are necessary in the fight against terrorism. It remains to be seen what impact Mehsud's death will have on the Pakistani Taliban and the broader fight against terrorism in Pakistan. The country has been dealing with a wave of violence in recent years, and the death of a high-profile militant leader could either exacerbate the situation or lead to a turning point in the fight against terrorism.","(386, 18)","Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud is dead, three Taliban sources and

Mehsud's death would be a major blow to the Pakistani Taliban, which has been waging a bloody insurgency against the Pakistani government since 2007.
The group has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the 2012 attack on a school in Peshawar that killed more than 140 people, most of them children.
If confirmed, Mehsud's death would also be a major victory for the United States, which has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture or death.
The United States has accused Mehsud of being behind a number of attacks on U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, including a 2009 suicide bombing that killed seven CIA employees in Khost, Afghanistan.
U.S. officials have said they believe Mehsud was responsible for the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt, although he has not been charged in connection with that attack.
The Pakistani Taliban is a separate group from the Afghan Taliban, but the two groups have close ties and often coordinate their activities.
The death of Mehsud would likely lead to a power struggle within the Pakistani Taliban, as different factions vie for control of the group.

","By . Andy Sims, Press Association . England shotgun ace Charlotte Kerwood blasted her way to Commonwealth Games glory in the double trap. The 27-year-old from Sussex was in devastating form at the Barry Buddon Centre in Dundee, nailing 94 of her 120 clays to claim her third individual Commonwealth gold medal. Kerwood won her first gold at Manchester 2002 aged just 15, and would probably have more in her collection had the event not been excluded in Delhi last time out. Shooting for gold: Charlotte Kerwood was in brilliant form in the double trap event . Easy peasy: Kerwood won her third Commonwealth Games gold medal in the double trap on Sunday . She finished two shots clear of India's Shreyasi Singh, who claimed silver. Rachel Parish, with whom Kerwood also won pairs gold at Melbourne 2006, made it a medal double for England by taking bronze. The 33-year-old from Nottingham finished level with Canada's Cynthia Meyer on 91 and triumphed in a sudden-death shoot-off. Kerwood led by five shots at the start of the final round and appeared relaxed, smiling and laughing, as the competitors lined up. But with Singh and Meyer closing in, she missed a pair halfway through the round and gave herself a dressing down before holding her nerve over the final few shots. 'It feels pretty good, I can't quite believe it,' Kerwood told Press Association Sport. 'The Commonwealth Games obviously like me, it's a good event to come to. 'I was laughing because I didn't realise I was five targets ahead at the start, so I thought 'no pressure!' Then I felt it was slipping away from me a little bit, which wasn't good. But now it feels amazing.' Congratulations: Kerwood gets a hug after easing to victory in the shooting double trap event . Kerwood will have little opportunity to celebrate, though, as she lines up in her favoured event, the Olympic trap, on Monday morning. 'That will be good experience for tomorrow because now I know what to expect with the crowd and everything. 'There's no time to celebrate yet. Tomorrow is what I have been training for. My coach thinks I was crazy going for this one as well but I'm going to be more confident now.' For Parish, who claimed silver behind Kerwood in the individual event eight years ago, it was also a test of nerve in the shoot-off. 'I've practised doing that before with the other England guys, I knew what was coming and I knew I'd done it before and I could do it again - and I did,' she said. 'I'm disappointed with the way I shot today, I know I can shoot a lot better than that, so I'm really pleased to have come away with a medal. 'I think there will be some champagne now. Possibly a lot!'","(547, 28)","British shooter Charlotte Kerwood added another gold medal to her impressive portfolio on Saturday at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. The 27-year-old nailed 94 of 120 clays to win her third Commonwealth gold, finishing two shots clear of India's Shreyasi Singh. Kerwood first tasted success in Manchester back in 2002, at the young age of just 15, when she won her first Commonwealth gold medal. Since then, she has become a familiar face in international shooting competitions and has continued to impress. ""I'm absolutely delighted,"" exclaimed Kerwood. ""It's always special to win a gold medal, but to do it at a major event like the Commonwealth Games is even sweeter. The competition was tough, but I managed to keep my focus and put in a solid performance."" Kerwood's focus will now turn to her favored event, the Olympic trap, which takes place on Monday. She will be hoping to add to her impressive collection of medals, which includes a silver at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and a bronze at the 2010 Delhi games. Despite her success on the international stage, Kerwood remains humble and dedicated to her craft. ""Shooting is a sport that requires a lot of hard work and training,"" she said. ""I'm constantly striving to improve my technique and consistency. It's a tough sport, but one that I love and am passionate about."" Kerwood's success is a testament to her determination and dedication, and she serves as an inspiration to aspiring shooters around the world. Her impressive collection of medals is a reminder that anything is possible with hard work and perseverance. The Commonwealth Games continue to provide a platform for young athletes to showcase their skills on an international stage. With competition stiffening every year, it is clear that this is where future Olympians are born. As the games draw to a close, it is clear that these athletes have left an indelible mark on the sporting world. They have demonstrated that with hard work, determination, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, anything is possible. We look forward to seeing what these athletes will achieve in the future.","(407, 20)","By. Andy Sims, Press Association. England shotgun ace Charlotte Kerwood blasted her way

(CNN) -- A man was shot and killed Saturday in Oakland, California, during a confrontation
","(CNN) -- A man was shot and killed Saturday in Oakland, California, during a confrontation with Bay Area Rapid Transit officers and Oakland police, police spokesman Jeff Thomason said. The incident occurred after Oakland police received a call about 8:15 a.m. (11:15 a.m. ET) of an armed man walking toward the Fruitvale BART station, according to Thomason. Police notified BART officers, who also responded. BART officers were the first to reach the suspect, described as a Hispanic male between 30 and 40 years old, Thomason said. The BART officers chased the man from the station to the street, where Oakland police joined in the pursuit over four blocks in the Fruitvale area. Thomason said Oakland police tried to Taser the man twice, but to no effect. The man, armed with two knives, then attempted to charge at one of the officers, a police statement said. Multiple officers opened fire, killing him, the statement said. The man has not yet been identified, Thomason said. The shooting is under investigation by the Oakland police homicide unit, internal affairs and the Alameda County district attorney. ""Anytime there is a loss of life, it is a matter of great concern and sadness for us all,"" Oakland Mayor Ronald Dellums said in a statement. ""It is extremely important that we as a community continue to work together in order to provide a safe and secure environment. Therefore, a thorough investigation of the circumstances surrounding this death has begun."" BART police have also opened a separate, parallel investigation. The incident comes more than a week after a former BART police officer was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2009 shooting death of an unarmed black man on a train platform at the Fruitvale station. The January 1, 2009, shooting of 22-year-old Oscar Grant was captured on a bystander's cell-phone video camera. The video was widely circulated on the Internet and on news broadcasts, and it spurred several protests in and around Oakland. The video showed former officer Johannes Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Grant in the back as another officer knelt on the unarmed man. Mehserle and other Bay Area Rapid Transit police had been called to the Fruitvale station after passengers complained about fights on a train. Officers pulled several men, including Grant, off the train when it arrived at Fruitvale.","(444, 21)","In a shocking turn of events, police officers responding to a report of an armed man near the Fruitvale BART station were forced to shoot the suspect after their attempts at subduing him failed. The man, who remains unidentified at this time, brandished a knife and refused to comply with police orders, leading to a deadly confrontation. According to eyewitnesses, the man appeared agitated and erratic when police arrived on the scene. Despite their efforts to deescalate the situation, the man continued to resist, leading to a tense standoff between police and the suspect. In an effort to subdue the man, police officers attempted to use Tasers on him twice, but to no avail. This only seemed to agitate the suspect further, as he turned on the officers with the knife in his hand. At this point, police officers were left with no choice but to use lethal force. They opened fire on the suspect, who was subsequently transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. As is the standard procedure in cases of police-involved shootings, an investigation has been launched to determine whether the officers' use of force was justified. The officers involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave pending the conclusion of the investigation. The shooting has sparked outrage and raised questions about police use of force, especially in cases involving people suffering from mental health issues. Critics argue that the officers in this incident could have done more to deescalate the situation before resorting to lethal force. In response to the shooting, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf released a statement expressing her condolences to the family of the deceased and promising a full investigation into the incident. ""The use of lethal force is always a last resort, and we owe it to the family and the community to understand what led to this tragic outcome,"" Schaaf said in the statement. The incident near the Fruitvale BART station serves as a stark reminder of the dangers that police officers face every day in their efforts to protect our communities. As the investigation into this incident continues, it is clear that there are no simple answers when it comes to issues of police use of force, mental health, and public safety.","(416, 16)","(CNN) -- A man was shot and killed Saturday in Oakland, California, during a confrontation

(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant
","(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant owners A.M.S.P Suppiah and his wife Kanageswary Suppiah. In a David-and-Goliath match-up in the world of fast food, McCurry -- a small Indian curry shop in Malaysia -- has won an eight-year legal battle against the hamburger giant. McDonald's claimed that the prefix ""Mc"" in McCurry trampled on its trademark. The country's Federal Court on Tuesday ruled that it didn't. ""We're very relieved -- much, much relieved -- that this eight-year-old saga is finally over,"" said McCurry owner P. Suppiah. ""We're a typical South Asian-Malay cuisine. No way people walking into McCurry can confuse us with McDonald's."" The sparse 24/7 self-service restaurant in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is popular with blue-collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare, such as biryani rice and fishhead curry. Its logo: a chicken flashing a thumbs-up. The eatery opened in 1999. McDonald's filed suit two years later. ""We were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court,"" Suppiah said. ""We felt that we had nothing in common, because we were not selling any Western fast food."" The hamburger chain, which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia, said McCurry was violating the prefix ""Mc"" and that McDonald's had the right to protect it. McCurry, in turn, said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across Europe. Furthermore, it said, the ""Mc"" in McCurry stands for ""Malaysian Chicken Curry."" A lower court ruled in favor of McDonald's, and Suppiah appealed. An appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling, prompting McDonald's to appeal this time. On Tuesday, the Federal Court -- the highest in the land -- held up the appeals court ruling. McDonald's said it accepts the judgment. ""We respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment,"" said Liam Jeory of McDonald's Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Suppiah said the ruling means he can now add other McCurry locations, with its slogan: ""Tasty and so Gooood.""","(425, 23)","In a surprise victory, the Indian restaurant chain McCurry has come out on top in a legal battle with fast food giant McDonald’s. In a case that has been dubbed a David-and-Goliath match-up, McDonald’s had claimed that the use of “Mc” in the McCurry name infringed on its trademark. However, the judge presiding over the case ultimately ruled in favor of McCurry, stating that there was no evidence of confusion between the two brands. McCurry owner P. Suppiah expressed relief at the decision, stating, “We’re very relieved -- much, much relieved.” The case was brought to court after McDonald’s filed a trademark infringement suit against McCurry. In the suit, McDonald’s argued that the use of “Mc” in the McCurry name and branding could cause confusion and dilute the McDonald’s trademark. The case was closely watched by many in the fast food industry, as it was seen as a test of whether the McDonald’s trademark was strong enough to prevent other companies from using similar names or branding. In his ruling, the judge noted that the two brands were quite distinct from one another, with McDonald’s primarily offering burgers and fries and McCurry specializing in Indian cuisine. The judge also pointed out that the use of “Mc” was not unique to McDonald’s and had been used by other companies in the past. Despite this ruling, McDonald’s has vowed to continue protecting its trademark and has said that it is considering an appeal. In a statement, the company said, “We are disappointed with the court’s decision and are currently considering our options. We remain committed to protecting our brand and trademarks.” McCurry, on the other hand, is celebrating its legal victory and has said that it will continue to operate under its current name and branding. The company’s success in this case could also potentially pave the way for other small businesses to use the “Mc” prefix in their names without fear of legal action from McDonald’s. Overall, the case highlights the challenges faced by smaller companies when taking on large corporations in legal battles, as well as the importance of protecting intellectual property and trademarks in the fast-paced and competitive world of fast food.","(432, 13)","(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant
defeated McDonald's in a legal battle over the use of the word ""Mc"" in its name, a Singapore court ruled Wednesday.
McDonald's had claimed that McCurry's use of the ""Mc"" infringed on its trademark, but the Singapore High Court rejected the fast food giant's argument.
""We're very relieved,"" McCurry owner P.Suppiah told CNN after the ruling. ""Much, much relieved.""
McDonald's said it was disappointed with the ruling and was considering an appeal.
McCurry, which serves Indian food, opened in 1997 in Singapore, where McDonald's has been operating since 1979. The two restaurants are located just a few blocks from each other in the city-state's Orchard Road shopping district.
McDonald's filed a lawsuit against McCurry in 2001, claiming that McCurry's name was too similar to McDonald's and would confuse customers into thinking the two restaurants were related.
McDonald's also argued that McCurry was trying to ride on the coattails of McDonald's success by using the ""Mc"" prefix in its name.
McCurry countered that it had been using the name for more than 10 years before McDonald's filed the lawsuit, and that there was no confusion between the two restaurants because they served different types of food.
The Singapore High Court agreed with McCurry, saying there was no evidence that customers were confused about the difference between the two restaurants.
The court also said that McDonald's had waited too long to file the lawsuit, as McCurry had been using its name for more than a decade before McDonald's took action.
McDonald's said in a statement that it was ""disappointed"" with the ruling, and that it was considering appealing the decision.
""We believe we have a strong case and will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights,"" the company said.
McCurry's Suppiah said he was happy with the ruling, but added that the legal battle had taken a toll on him and his family.
""It's been a very stressful time for us,"" he said. ""We're just glad that it's finally over.""
McCurry's victory is a rare win for a small business against a multinational corporation. In recent years, large companies have been increasingly aggressive in protecting their trademarks, often filing lawsuits against small businesses that they claim are infringing on their intellectual property.
The case is also significant because it could set a precedent for other small businesses in Singapore and around the world that are facing similar challenges from large corporations.
McCurry plans to continue operating under its current name, and Suppiah says he hopes the ruling will send a message to other small businesses that they can stand up to big corporations.
""I hope this will give other small businesses the courage to fight back when they're being bullied by big companies,"" he said.","(562, 23)","(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant

Suppiah said he had no plans to change the name of his restaurant.
""I don't think I'll change the name,"" he said. ""I think it's a good name. It's a very good name.""
The court ruled that McDonald's had failed to prove that the use of the name would cause confusion among customers.
The court also said McDonald's did not have a monopoly on the use of ""Mc.""
""The use of 'Mc' is not exclusive to McDonald's,"" the court said in its ruling. ""It is also used by other fast food restaurants.""
The ruling is a victory for McCurry, which has been in business for more than 20 years.
Suppiah, who has been in the restaurant business for 30 years, said he had been using the name McCurry since he opened his first restaurant in 1990.

ROME, Italy -- Captain Javier Zanetti saved Inter Milan's unbeaten Serie A record as he
","ROME, Italy -- Captain Javier Zanetti saved Inter Milan's unbeaten Serie A record as he rifled home a stunning late volley to earn a 1-1 draw against second-placed Roma at the San Siro on Wednesday. Zanetti celebrates his late strike as Inter retained their unbeaten Serie A record with a 1-1 draw against Roma. Roma captain Francesco Totti had given the visitors a deserved first-half leadbut Zanetti's strike two minutes from time maintained Inter's nine-point lead at the top. Roma needed to win to breathe new life into the title race but they were dealt a cruel blow as French defender Philippe Mexes was sent-off late on for two bookings in quick succession. Inter capitalised and they have now lost only once in their last 65 league matches. The home side had the first clear-cut chance of the match and were within centimeters of taking the lead when Hernan Crespo met a cross from Patrick Vieira with an acrobatic volley, but saw his effort cannon back off the post. The defending champions were made to pay for that miss on 38 minutes as the visitors orchestrated a sublime goal. Neat footwork from Macedonia international Mirko Vucinic released Max Tonetto down the left and his pin-point cross was flicked home at the near post by Totti from six meters out as he stole in front of defender Cristian Chivu. Inter center-back Nicolas Burdisso should have restored parity in first-half stoppage time but his header from Luis Figo's corner flew over the bar. Figo himself had a great chance on 54 minutes but after having time to set himself up for an attempted volley, he skewed his effort so badly that it did not even go out of play. After Mexes' dismissal 10 from time, Inter laid siege to Roma's goal. Goalkeeper Doni had to be alert to tip over Crespo's header three minutes from time but he could do nothing about Zanetti's volley a minute later. Meanwhile, AC Milan slipped to fifth place as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Catania. Brazilian teenager Pato gave them the lead early in the second half with a skimming long-range shot but substitute Gionathan Spinesi's header earnt the Sicilians a point. Fiorentina are up to fourth after they defeated Livorno 1-0 at home thanks to a goal from Senegal forward Ndiaye Papa Waigo. E-mail to a friend .","(425, 16)","In a thrilling Serie A encounter, Inter Milan managed to salvage a 1-1 draw against Roma thanks to a late goal from their ever-reliable skipper, Javier Zanetti. Despite the draw, the result ensured that Inter Milan maintained their comfortable nine-point lead at the top of the Serie A table and remained unbeaten in the league. The match had started off in a high-octane fashion with both sides creating opportunities, but none were converted in the opening period. Roma took the lead in the 60th minute when Simone Perrotta fired home following a neat one-two with Francesco Totti. Roma held on to their lead for over thirty minutes as Inter Milan peppered the opposition goal with shots. Inter Milan finally found the equalizer in the 92nd minute when their beloved captain Javier Zanetti struck a stunning shot into the bottom corner of the Roma net, sending the Inter faithful into absolute delirium. Zanetti's late contribution was a fitting tribute to the legend on his 600th appearance for the club. The draw was a valuable point for Roma who had been on a poor run of form recently, while Inter Milan maintained their cushion at the top of the table. The result also meant that enemy city rivals AC Milan slipped down to fifth place after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Catania. Milan had taken the lead in the 17th minute through Robinho's header, but Catania equalized just before half-time through a goal from Gonzalo Bergessio. Despite intense pressure from Milan during the second half, they were unable to find a winner, as Catania defended resolutely. The draw left Milan five points behind Inter Milan, who continued to set the pace in the Serie A race. The result also marked Milan's second consecutive draw, following their stalemate against Udinese in the previous game week. With just a handful of games remaining in the season, Inter Milan will look to maintain their lead and remain unbeaten, while AC Milan will need to win their remaining games if they are to bridge the gap to their rivals. One thing is for certain, the Serie A title race is far from over, and there promises to be plenty of twists and turns in the coming weeks.","(407, 15)","ROME, Italy -- Captain Javier Zanetti saved Inter Milan's unbeaten Serie A record as he
