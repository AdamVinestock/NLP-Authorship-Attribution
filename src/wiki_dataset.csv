Introduction: Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands.
	
The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.","(288, 11)","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups inhabiting the Maluku Islands. The term ""Moluccan"" is an umbrella term that covers the various Austronesian and Papuan languages spoken on the islands. The largest group of Moluccans are the Tolo-speaking people.

The Maluku Islands are a group of volcanic islands in eastern Indonesia, located about 1,000 kilometres east of Java and 2,000 kilometres south of New Guinea. The islands comprise over 700 islands, with a total land area of approximately 245,000 square kilometres. They have a population of around 1 million people, most of whom are Muslim. The largest island group is the Tolo-speaking region, which comprises over 60% of the population.

The Moluccas were first explored by Europeans in 1512. Portuguese explorer João da Nova discovered Ternate and Tidore, while Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen discovered Halmahera and Bougainville. The Moluccas were later visited by Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.

Introduction: Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups of the Moluccas, an Indonesian archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean. The Moluccas are also known as the Spice Islands because of their importance in the spice trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. Moluccans speak a variety of Austronesian languages, including Malayo-Polynesian, Malayo-Indonesian, and Papuan languages. The majority of Moluccans live on the islands of Ambon, Seram, Halmahera, Ternate, and Bacan. Moluccan culture is a blend of Indonesian and Melanesian cultures, with influences from China, India, and the Middle East.
The Moluccas have been inhabited by Austronesian peoples since at least the 2nd millennium BC. The first Europeans to arrive in the Moluccan archipelago were the Portuguese in 1512, followed by the Dutch in 1596. In the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post on the island of Ternate. The Portuguese and Dutch fought for control of the archipelago until the Dutch finally gained control in 1662. The Dutch ruled the archipelago as a colony until 1942, when it was occupied by the Japanese during World War II. After the war, the archipelago was divided between Indonesia and the Netherlands, with Indonesia taking control of the western half and the Netherlands retaining control of the eastern half.
Moluccans are a group of people who live in the Indonesian archipelago of the same name. They are descended from Austronesian people who migrated to the archipelago from mainland Southeast Asia around 2,000 years ago. Today, Moluccans make up less than 1% of Indonesia's population, but they are an important part of the country's cultural and economic life. Molucca is the name given to the arch","[(362, 19)]"

Introduction: The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly","The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinent containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. 
These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian and Bantu settlers. Despite popular belief, there has been no genetic input from Arabs or Indians, although one tribe, the Antemoro, claims descent from Somali Arab traders. European and Middle eastern paternal ancestry is also present.","(217, 7)","The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly from that of neighbouring islands by its unique blend of traditional and colonial influences. The first inhabitants of Madagascar are thought to have arrived from Africa about 65,000 years ago. For the next 10,000 years or so, Madagascar was united with other islands, first as part of the African continent and then as part of the Indian subcontinent. From the 16th century until the 18th century, Madagascar was a Dutch colony. In 1795 it became a French colony. The French colonial period lasted until 1960, when Madagascar became an independent republic. 

Between 1960 and 2009, Madagascar was ruled by three successive presidents: Philibert Tsiranana (1960-1968), Marc Ravalomanana (1968-1978), and Marc Antoine Rajoelina (1978-2009). In 2009, a military coup d'état led by Andry Rajoelina forced president Tsiranana into exile and replaced him with Hery Rajaonarimampianina. Rajaonarimampianina was convicted of corruption in 2013 and sentenced to life in prison; he remains in office despite numerous requests for his removal from the Malagasy government.

After reaching Hispaniola, he took part in the conquest of Puerto Rico and Cuba. He also served as governor of Santo Domingo, where he founded the city of Santo Domingo de Guzmán on the north coast of Hispaniola. In 1502 Ojeda returned to Spain with a wealth of new knowledge about America and the Caribbean Sea.

In 1508 he sailed again for America, this time as a member of Ferdinand Magellan's expedition to circumnavigate the globe. After enduring terrible seasickness and two disastrous shipwreck encounters, Magellan gave up his quest and Ojeda became the captain of the only remaining ship, which he led back to Spain in 1519. Along the way, he discovered Guam and claimed it for Spain. Ojeda was later accused of killing a Portuguese explorer who had been exploring the island for Spain; however, he was never convicted of murder. 

Ojeda died in Cádiz or Seville around 1524, aged about 66 years old.",,,,"Your role is a Wikipedia contributor. Compose a Wikipedia-style introduction for the topic 'Alonso de Ojeda'.

Introduction: Alonso de Ojeda (; c. 1466 – c. 1515) was a Spanish explorer, navigator, and conquistador. He was the first European to set foot on the mainland of South America, and the first to circumnavigate the continent. Ojeda was born in Seville, Spain, in 1466, the son of a nobleman. He was educated at the University of Salamanca, where he studied law. In 1492, Ojeda accompanied Christopher Columbus on his second voyage to the New World. In 1500, Ojeda was appointed governor of Hispaniola (modern-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic). In 1508, Ojeda led an expedition to the Caribbean island of Guanahani (now known as San Salvador), where he established the first European settlement in the Americas. Ojeda returned to Spain in 1510, and in 1511, he led an expedition up the Orinoco River in search of El Dorado, the fabled city of gold. Ojeda died in 1515, and his remains were interred in the Cathedral of Seville. Ojeda is regarded as one of the most important explorers in the history of the Spanish Empire. He is often referred to as the ""discoverer"" of the Americas, although he was not the first person to set foot in the New World (that distinction belongs to Christopher Columbus). Ojeda is also known for his role in the colonization of the Americas. He was one of the first Europeans to explore the Caribbean, and he was the first to establish a permanent settlement in the region. Ojeda also played a key role in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, which led to the Spanish colonization of Mexico and Central America. Ojeda's legacy is often overshadowed by that of Columbus, but he was an important figure in the exploration and colonization","[(385, 19)]"
