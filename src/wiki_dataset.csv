Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic
","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands.
	
The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.","(288, 11)","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups inhabiting the Maluku Islands. The term ""Moluccan"" is an umbrella term that covers the various Austronesian and Papuan languages spoken on the islands. The largest group of Moluccans are the Tolo-speaking people.

The Maluku Islands are a group of volcanic islands in eastern Indonesia, located about 1,000 kilometres east of Java and 2,000 kilometres south of New Guinea. The islands comprise over 700 islands, with a total land area of approximately 245,000 square kilometres. They have a population of around 1 million people, most of whom are Muslim. The largest island group is the Tolo-speaking region, which comprises over 60% of the population.

The Moluccas were first explored by Europeans in 1512. Portuguese explorer João da Nova discovered Ternate and Tidore, while Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen discovered Halmahera and Bougainville. The Moluccas were later visited by Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. British explorer James Cook visited Ternate, Tidore, Halmahera, and Bougainville during his first voyage in 1770–71.","(188, 11)","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic
groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands in eastern Indonesia. The Moluccan
people have a rich cultural heritage that has been shaped by their unique
geographical location and historical experiences. This essay will provide an
introduction to the Moluccan people, including their history, culture, and
current situation.
The Moluccan people have a long and complex history that dates back to
ancient times. The islands of the Moluccas were once known as the ""Spice
Islands"" due to their abundance of spices such as cloves, nutmeg, and
cinnamon. These spices were highly sought after by traders from around the
world, including the Portuguese, Dutch, and British. As a result, the
Moluccan people were exposed to a variety of cultures and influences, which
shaped their identity and way of life.
One of the most significant events in Moluccan history was the Dutch
colonization of the islands in the 17th century. The Dutch East India
Company established a trading post on the island of Ambon and gradually
expanded its control over the other islands in the archipelago. The Dutch
brought Christianity to the Moluccas and introduced new technologies and
ways of life. However, they also imposed strict rules and regulations on the
local population, which led to resentment and resistance.
In the 20th century, the Moluccas experienced a period of political
instability and conflict. In 1949, the Dutch granted independence to the
Republic of Indonesia, which included the Moluccan islands. However, many
Moluccans felt that they had been betrayed by the Dutch and resented the
Indonesian government's policies towards them. In 1950, a group of Moluccan
soldiers mutinied against the Indonesian government and took refuge in the
Netherlands. This event became known as the Moluccan Affair and led to
further tensions between the Moluccans and the Indonesian government.
Today, the Moluccans are a diverse group of people who speak a variety of
languages and practice different religions. The majority of Moluccans are
Muslim, but there are also significant Christian and animist communities.
The Moluccans have a strong sense of identity and pride in their cultural
heritage, which is reflected in their music, dance, and art. They are also
known for their hospitality and warm welcome to visitors.

The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly
","The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinent containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. 
These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian and Bantu settlers. Despite popular belief, there has been no genetic input from Arabs or Indians, although one tribe, the Antemoro, claims descent from Somali Arab traders. European and Middle eastern paternal ancestry is also present.","(217, 7)","The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly from that of neighbouring islands by its unique blend of traditional and colonial influences. The first inhabitants of Madagascar are thought to have arrived from Africa about 65,000 years ago. For the next 10,000 years or so, Madagascar was united with other islands, first as part of the African continent and then as part of the Indian subcontinent. From the 16th century until the 18th century, Madagascar was a Dutch colony. In 1795 it became a French colony. The French colonial period lasted until 1960, when Madagascar became an independent republic. 

Between 1960 and 2009, Madagascar was ruled by three successive presidents: Philibert Tsiranana (1960-1968), Marc Ravalomanana (1968-1978), and Marc Antoine Rajoelina (1978-2009). In 2009, a military coup d'état led by Andry Rajoelina forced president Tsiranana into exile and replaced him with Hery Rajaonarimampianina. Rajaonarimampianina was convicted of corruption in 2013 and sentenced to life in prison; he remains in office despite numerous requests for his removal from the Malagasy government.

Madagascar is an island country located in the Indian Ocean, off the southeastern coast of Africa. It is the fourth-largest island in the world and is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including lemurs, chameleons, and baobab trees. The history of Madagascar can be divided into several distinct periods, each with its own unique characteristics and developments.
The earliest inhabitants of Madagascar are believed to have arrived on the island around 2000 BCE. These early settlers were likely Austronesian people from Southeast Asia, who brought with them their language, culture, and agricultural practices. Over time, these early settlers intermarried with the indigenous Malagasy people, resulting in the formation of the Malagasy ethnic group.
The first recorded contact between Madagascar and the outside world occurred in the 9th century CE, when Arab traders arrived on the island. These traders brought with them Islam, which quickly spread throughout the island. In the 15th century, Portuguese explorers arrived on the island, followed by Dutch, French, and British traders in the 17th and 18th centuries. These foreign influences had a significant impact on the island's culture, economy, and politics.
In the 19th century, Madagascar became a French protectorate, and in 1896, it was formally annexed by France. Under French rule, Madagascar experienced significant economic and social changes, including the introduction of new crops, such as coffee and vanilla, and the development of infrastructure, such as roads and railways. However, many Malagasy people resented French rule, and in 1947, a nationalist uprising known as the Malagasy Uprising broke out. The uprising was brutally suppressed by the French, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Malagasy people.
In 1958, Madagascar gained independence from France, and in 1960, it became a republic. The first president of independent Madagascar was Philibert Tsiranana, who ruled the country until 1972. During his tenure, Tsiranana implemented a series of economic and social reforms, including the nationalization of key industries and the introduction of a new constitution. However, Tsiranana's government was criticized for its authoritarianism and corruption, and in 1972, he was overthrown in a military coup led by General Gabriel Ramanantsoa.
Ramanantsoa ruled Madagascar for two years before being overthrown in another military coup in 1975. The coup was led by Colonel Didier Ratsiraka","(443, 20)","The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly

Alonso de Ojeda (; c. 1466 –
","Alonso de Ojeda  (; c. 1466 – c. 1515) was a Spanish explorer, governor and conquistador. He travelled through modern-day Guyana, Venezuela, Trinidad, Tobago, Curaçao, Aruba and Colombia. He navigated with Amerigo Vespucci who is famous for having named Venezuela, which he explored during his first two expeditions, for having been the first European to visit Guyana, Curaçao, Colombia, and  Lake Maracaibo, and later for founding Santa Cruz (La Guairita). Early life 
Alonso de Ojeda was born in Torrejoncillo del Rey, New Castile around 1466. His father, Rodrigo de Huete, was a minor noble who fought for Isabel in 1474 during the War of the Castilian Succession. Isabel was grateful for his support and put his son, Alonso, under her protection. In his youth, Alonso served the Duke of Medinaceli, Luis de la Cerda. In service to the duke, he distinguished himself in the conquest of Granada with his military abilities, his skill as a swordsman and his bravery.","(192, 8)","Alonso de Ojeda  (; c. 1466 – c. 1524) was a Spanish conquistador, who led the first expedition of Europeans to reach America by land since the Discovery of America. He is considered the first European explorer of the Americas.

Ojeda was born in Palencia, Spain circa 1466. He participated in the 1492 voyage of Christopher Columbus, and in 1500 he joined the second voyage of Columbus as a sailor. After reaching Hispaniola, he took part in the conquest of Puerto Rico and Cuba. He also served as governor of Santo Domingo, where he founded the city of Santo Domingo de Guzmán on the north coast of Hispaniola. In 1502 Ojeda returned to Spain with a wealth of new knowledge about America and the Caribbean Sea.

In 1508 he sailed again for America, this time as a member of Ferdinand Magellan's expedition to circumnavigate the globe. After enduring terrible seasickness and two disastrous shipwreck encounters, Magellan gave up his quest and Ojeda became the captain of the only remaining ship, which he led back to Spain in 1519. Along the way, he discovered Guam and claimed it for Spain. Ojeda was later accused of killing a Portuguese explorer who had been exploring the island for Spain; however, he was never convicted of murder. 

Ojeda died in Cádiz or Seville around 1524, aged about 66 years old.","(253, 12)","Alonso de Ojeda (; c. 1466 –

Ojeda was born in Granada, Spain, around 1466. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he served as a page in the court of Queen Isabella I of Castile. In 1492, he accompanied Christopher Columbus on his first voyage to the Americas. During this expedition, Ojeda explored the Caribbean islands of Hispaniola, Cuba, and Jamaica.
In 1499, Ojeda led his own expedition to the Americas. He sailed from Spain with a fleet of four ships and a crew of about 300 men. The expedition's goal was to explore the coast of South America and search for gold and other riches. Ojeda and his men landed on the coast of Venezuela, where they encountered the indigenous people of the region. Ojeda's men enslaved many of the indigenous people and forced them to work in the gold mines.
In 1500, Ojeda returned to Spain with a large amount of gold and other treasures. However, he was accused of mistreating the indigenous people and enslaving them against their will. As a result, he was stripped of his title and banished from Spain. He spent the rest of his life in exile, traveling throughout Europe and the Middle East.
Ojeda died in 1515, while on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He was buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Today, Ojeda is remembered as one of the early explorers of the Americas and as a controversial figure in the history of Spanish colonization.","(342, 18)","Alonso de Ojeda (; c. 1466 –

Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method
","Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method by which developers can purchase the development rights of certain parcels within a designated ""sending district"" and transfer the rights to another ""receiving district"" to increase the density of their new development. The underlying legal concept of a transfer of development rights programme is the notion that all land has a bundle of property rights. It is used for controlling land use to complement land-use planning and zoning for more effective urban growth management and land conservation. Description 
The TDR process can be considered a tool for controlling urban sprawl by concentrating development. TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of development control. In the United States, TDR are also a way to avoid constitutional takings issues caused by rezoning areas that would otherwise eliminate a significant amount of value from the property. The procedure offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of the environmental, heritage or agricultural values of their land. TDR is based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or land development. These land-based development rights can in some jurisdictions be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred by the owner of a parcel. ","(232, 9)","Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method of transferring development rights in a project from the original developer to another party. The term is most commonly used in the context of real estate development.

The purpose of TDR is to provide a way for the original developer to relinquish control of a project without having to sell the property or give up any ownership rights. This can be useful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the property.

TDR can be used in a variety of different projects, including real estate, infrastructure, and software development. Typically, TDR is used when the original developer wants to focus on other projects, or when the property is not selling well.

There are a number of different methods for transferring TDRs. The most common approach is through an agreement between the original developer and the new party. Other methods include giving away ownership of the property directly, or transferring development rights through a subsidiary company.

There are several advantages to using TDRs. First, it can provide a way for the original developer to exit a project without having to give up any ownership rights. This can be helpful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the project.

Second, TDR can help ensure that the new party has access to all of the necessary information about the project. This can help ensure that the project is completed as planned, and that any changes made by the new party are properly reflected in the","(290, 14)","Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method
of land use planning that allows property owners
to transfer their development rights to other
properties within a designated area. This approach
is often used in urban areas where there is a
need to preserve open space or protect natural
resources while still allowing for growth and
development. The concept of TDR was first
introduced in the United States in the 1960s and
has since been adopted by many states and local
governments as a tool for smart growth and
sustainable development. In this article, we will
explore the basics of TDR, including how it works,
the benefits and challenges of implementing it,
and some examples of successful TDR programs.
How Transferable Development Rights Work
Transferable development rights work by allowing
property owners to transfer their development
rights to other properties within a designated
area. This can be done through a variety of
mechanisms, including the sale of development
rights, the donation of development rights, or the
exchange of development rights for other
benefits. The key idea behind TDR is that it allows
property owners to maximize the value of their
property while still preserving open space or
protecting natural resources.
Benefits of Transferable Development Rights
There are several benefits to using TDR as a tool
for land use planning. One of the main benefits is
that it allows for the preservation of open space
and natural resources while still allowing for
growth and development. By transferring
development rights to other properties, TDR can
help to create a more sustainable and livable
environment. Additionally, TDR can help to
stimulate economic development by creating new
opportunities for investment and job creation.
Challenges of Implementing Transferable
Development Rights
Despite the many benefits of TDR, there are also
some challenges to implementing it. One of the
main challenges is that it can be complex and
difficult to administer. TDR programs require
careful planning and coordination between
multiple stakeholders, including property owners,
developers, and government agencies. Another
challenge is that TDR can be controversial, as it
involves the transfer of development rights from
one property to another. This can raise concerns
about equity and fairness, as some property
owners may benefit more than others from the
transfer of development rights.
Examples of Successful Transferable Development
Rights Programs
Despite the challenges, there have been several
successful TDR programs implemented in the
United States. One example is the","(434, 18)","Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method

After graduation he refused to join the Communist party, undermining his job prospects, though he found employment at a regional planning office. He married Eva, who was studying to be a physician. In 1969, following the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and also Eva's graduation, the Smils emigrated to the US, leaving the country months before a Soviet travel ban shut the borders.

The Opéra-Comique at that time presented operas light in tone and with spoken dialogue between the musical numbers. She created leading roles in many opéras comiques including  the title role in ""La marquise de Brinvilliers"", a collaborative work between nine composers, and in works by Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas, and others. Considered one of the major stars of the lyric stage of her day, Prévost was esteemed for her  unaffected stage presence, her charm of person and manner, her skills as a comic actress, and her excellent singing technique. She created the leading soprano roles in two opéras comiques still performed today, Zerlina in ""Fra Diavolo"" by Auber in 1830 and Madeleine in ""Le postillon de Lonjumeau"" by Adam in 1836, the most successful works of those two composers. In the latter work, as in others, she appeared opposite her husband, leading tenor Jean-Baptiste Chollet, by whom she had one daughter, Caroline, who also achieved success as a singer under the stage name Mademoiselle Monrose. Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost also appeared in other French and Belgian opera houses.","(310, 10)","Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost (15 April 1802, Paris – 12 September 1863, Paris) was a French artist and writer.

Prévost began her artistic career as an illustrator and caricaturist. In 1829, she published her first book, a collection of children's drawings titled ""Les Aventures de Toto"". In 1835, she published her first novel, ""L'Éducation sentimentale"".

Prévost's fame as an artist grew rapidly in the 1840s. She became one of the leading exponents of Romantic painting in France. Her most famous works from this period include ""La Joconde"" (1840), ""Napoléon Ier enfermé à Saint-Helena"" (1843), and ""Les Deux Magots"" (1875).

Prévost also became known for her poetry. Her best-known works from this period include the poetry collection ""Le Coeur sur la main"" (1848) and the novel ""La Mare au dessus des flots"" (1856).

","Carolina Oliphant, Lady Nairne (16 August 1766 – 26 October 1845) – also known as Carolina Baroness Nairn in the peerage of Scotland and Baroness Keith in that of the United Kingdom – was a Scottish songwriter.
Many of her songs, such as, ""Will ye no' come back again?"", ""Charlie is my Darling"" , ""The Rowan Tree"" and ""Wi' a Hundred Pipers' remain popular today, almost two hundred years after they were written. One of her songs, ""Caller Herrin'"", was sung at the 2021 commemoration of the 1881 Eyemouth disaster. She usually set her words to traditional Scottish folk melodies, but sometimes contributed her own music. Carolina Nairne and her contemporary Robert Burns were influenced by the Jacobite heritage in their establishment of a distinct Scottish identity, through what they both called national song. Perhaps in the belief that her work would not be taken seriously if it were known that she was a woman, Nairne went to considerable lengths to conceal her identity (even from her husband) when submitting her work for publication. Early on she called herself Mrs Bogan of Bogan, but feeling that gave too much away she often attributed her songs to the gender-neutral B.B., S.M., or ""Unknown"".","(242, 8)","Carolina Oliphant, Lady Nairne (16 August 1766 – 8 September 1837) was an Irish aristocrat, beauty and writer.

Lord Nairne died in 1828, leaving Lady Nairne with a large fortune. She continued to live in Dublin until her death on 8 September 1837.

Lady Nairne is best known for her writing. She published two volumes of poetry, ""Poems Written during a Residence at Venice"" (1807) and ""Poems Written during a Residence at Malmaison"" (1812), as well as a novel, ""The Heiress of Glenvar"" (1815).

Her father died when she was two years old, and she was brought up by her mother's family at Taymouth Castle in Perthshire.

After her husband's death, Nairne returned to Scotland and settled in Edinburgh, where she became a prominent figure in the city's social and literary circles. She was a member of the Caledonian Hunt, and was known for her love of horses and riding.
Nairne's first published work was a collection of songs entitled ""The Melodies of Scotland"", which was published in 1792. The collection included several of her own compositions, as well as songs by other Scottish poets and musicians. Her most famous song, ""Scots Who Hae"", was first published in this collection.

Great job! Your introduction is well-written and informative. It provides a clear definition of Sugar Hill, as well as key details and context that will help readers understand the topic. However, there are a few things you can do to make your introduction even better.
First, try to use more specific language when describing the neighborhood. For example, instead of saying that Sugar Hill is a ""historically middle class neighborhood,"" you could say that it is a ""middle class neighborhood with a rich history."" This will help readers get a better sense of what the neighborhood is like.
Second, try to include more information about the people who live in Sugar Hill. For example, you could mention that the neighborhood is home to many African American families, or that it is a popular destination for young professionals. This will help readers connect with the topic on a personal level.
Finally, try to avoid using passive voice whenever possible. Passive voice can make your writing sound dull and impersonal. Instead, try to use active voice, which will make your writing more engaging and interesting.
Overall, your introduction is a great start. With a few tweaks, it could be even better. Keep up the good work!","(489, 29)",,

Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house,
","Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, rebuilt in 1761 as a Scottish Gothic style Palladian manor, with clear evidence of prehistoric use of the site. It is situated immediately west of the town of Stonehaven in Kincardineshire, slightly to the west of the A90 dual carriageway.  Other notable historic fortified houses or castles in this region are Dunnottar Castle, Muchalls Castle, Fiddes Castle, Cowie Castle and Monboddo House. Prehistory
From cropmarks in the ""policies"" (improved areas) around Fetteresso Castle, there is evidence of a ring ditch sited at the north end of a cursus.  A cursus is a prehistoric set of parallel linear structures of unknown purpose that were, somewhat fancifully, considered by antiquarians as used for some type of athletic competition, possibly related to hunting or archery; this is unsubstantiated. In 1822 a cairn was discovered near Fetteresso Castle with some human remains inside. The size and shape of the chamber made of unhewn whinstone clearly show that the burial site was a Bronze Age construct. Some legends say that this is the grave of Malcolm I, who is recorded to have been slain at Fetteresso in AD 954. The burial hillock has become known as Malcolm's Mount, even though it is not likely from current archaeological analysis that the crypt could be so recent. In 1998 a burial urn from the Beaker people was found at Fetteresso Castle. The Roman Camp of Raedykes is located several miles north-west, where a full legion encamped and many archaeological recoveries have been made. This location is one of a string of marching camps that connected Angus to Moray.","(299, 12)","Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, located in the village of Fetteresso, in the Scottish Borders.

The castle passed through several hands before being acquired by the Drummond family in the 16th century. The Drummond family were responsible for some major alterations to the castle, including the addition of a walled courtyard and tower. The Drummond family remained in ownership of Fetteresso Castle until 1782, when it was sold to Colonel George Maxwell. The Maxwell family retained ownership of Fetteresso Castle until 1935, when it was sold to the National Trust for Scotland.

Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map
","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map design, is a property of a map in which the map image can be partitioned into a single feature or type of feature that is considered as an object of attention (the figure), with the remainder of the map being relegated to the background, outside the current focus of attention. It is thus based on the concept of figure–ground from Gestalt psychology. For example, in a street map with strong figure-ground contrast, the reader would be able to isolate and focus attention on individual features, like a given street, park, or lake, as well as layers of related features, like the street network. Strong figure-ground contrast has been seen as a desirable goal of map design, because it helps the map reader to perceive distinct geographic phenomena in the map. This allows more complex composition techniques such as visual hierarchy to organize these phenomena into clear structures that help readers use the map for its intended purposes.","(183, 5)","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of mapmaking, is the difference between the shapes and sizes of the features depicted on a map and the spaces around them. The term generally applies to maps of real or imaginary landscapes, but can also be used for maps of abstract concepts.

Figure-ground contrast is an important consideration in mapmaking because it affects how viewers interact with a map. For instance, if most of the features on a map are large and well-defined, viewers may feel overwhelmed and lose their sense of orientation. If, on the other hand, most features are small and subtle, viewers may be more likely to notice and appreciate them.

In cartography, figure-ground contrast is often achieved through the use of scale. Large features are typically drawn at a larger scale than smaller features, in order to make them more noticeable. Conversely, smaller features are typically drawn at a smaller scale than larger features, in order to preserve their visibility.

Figure-ground contrast is also important for portraying information on a map. For instance, if a map contains a lot of information about one specific area, it may be difficult to see if that information is balanced among the various features on the map. By contrasting large areas with small areas, cartographers can help to improve legibility.","(242, 11)","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map
In the field of cartography, figure-ground contrast refers to the visual distinction between foreground and background elements on a map. It is a fundamental concept that plays a crucial role in enhancing the legibility and readability of maps. By effectively utilizing figure-ground contrast, cartographers can create maps that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly informative and easy to interpret.
To understand figure-ground contrast, it is important to first define the terms 'figure' and 'ground'. In cartography, the figure refers to the prominent or salient elements on a map, such as roads, buildings, or landmarks. On the other hand, the ground refers to the less prominent or background elements, such as vegetation, water bodies, or terrain features. The goal of figure-ground contrast is to create a clear separation between these two elements, allowing the viewer to easily distinguish between what is important and what is not.
There are several techniques that cartographers can employ to achieve effective figure-ground contrast. One commonly used technique is the use of color. By assigning different colors to the figure and ground elements, cartographers can visually separate them and make them stand out. For example, roads and buildings can be represented in bright colors, while vegetation and water bodies can be depicted in muted tones. This technique not only enhances the figure-ground contrast but also adds a sense of depth and dimension to the map.
Another technique that can be used to enhance figure-ground contrast is the use of line weight. By varying the thickness of lines representing different features, cartographers can emphasize certain elements and de-emphasize others. For example, major roads can be represented with thicker lines, while minor roads can be depicted with thinner lines. This technique allows the viewer to quickly identify the most important features on the map and navigate through it more efficiently.
In addition to color and line weight, cartographers can also utilize shading and texture to create figure-ground contrast. Shading can be used to add depth and perspective to the map, while texture can be used to differentiate between different types of terrain or land cover. For example, a map of a mountainous region can be shaded to create the illusion of hills and valleys, while a map of a desert can be textured to represent the sand dunes.
It is important to note that achieving effective figure-ground contrast requires careful consideration of the map's purpose and audience. Different types of maps may require different levels of figure-ground contrast, depending on the information they need to convey. For instance, a road map designed for navigation purposes may require a higher level of figure","(492, 22)",,

Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated
","Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of an innocent person by means of capital punishment; therefore, it is a subset of wrongful execution. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as ""death inflicted by process of law, capital punishment, esp. considered to be unjust or cruel"". Example
An early case in which charges of judicial murder were raised was the Amboyna massacre in 1623, which caused a legal dispute between the English and Dutch governments over the conduct of a court in the Dutch East Indies that had ordered the execution of ten English men accused of treason. The dispute centered around differing interpretations of the legal jurisdiction of the court in question. The English believed that this court had not been competent to try and execute these EIC members, and so believed the executions to have been fundamentally illegal, thus constituting ""judicial murder"". The Dutch, on the other hand, believed the court to have been fundamentally competent, and wished to focus instead on misconduct of the particular judges in the court.","(194, 7)","Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of a judge, prosecutor, or other judicial officer. It is a form of assassination.

Judicial murder is a form of assassination that has been seen in many countries around the world. Judicial murder is most commonly associated with countries that have a history of instability and corruption. In some cases, judicial murder has been used to quash investigations into political corruption and to remove political opponents from power. Judicial murder can also be used to intimidate judges and prosecutors from carrying out their duties.

Judicial murder can take many different forms. Some examples include: shooting or bombarding a judge or prosecutor as they leave work or court; poisoning or smothering a judge or prosecutor in their sleep; rigging trials against the victim; or kidnapping and torturing the victim in order to extract information about their investigation into political corruption.

Judicial murder is a serious threat to the integrity of the justice system and the rule of law. It undermines the public's confidence in the judiciary and can lead to a spiral of corruption and violence. Governments must take measures to protect judges and prosecutors from attack, and they must ensure that investigations into judicial murder are carried out vigorously and impartially.","(229, 11)","Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated
killing of a person by a court of law, usually as a punishment for a crime.
It is a form of capital punishment that has been used throughout history in various cultures and legal systems.
The term ""judicial murder"" is often used to describe cases where an innocent person is convicted of a crime they did not commit and subsequently executed.
This can occur due to a variety of factors, including false confessions, faulty eyewitness testimony, and prosecutorial misconduct.
One of the most famous examples of judicial murder is the case of Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian immigrants who were convicted of murder in Massachusetts in 1920.
Despite overwhelming evidence of their innocence, they were sentenced to death and executed in 1927.
Another example is the case of the Scottsboro Boys, nine African American teenagers who were falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama in 1931.
They were convicted and sentenced to death, but their sentences were later commuted to life in prison.
In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of wrongful convictions and executions in the United States, leading to calls for reform of the criminal justice system.
One such case is that of Cameron Todd Willingham, who was executed in Texas in 2004 for allegedly setting a fire that killed his three daughters.
However, new evidence has emerged suggesting that the fire was accidental and that Willingham was innocent.
These cases highlight the importance of ensuring that the criminal justice system is fair and just, and that innocent people are not punished for crimes they did not commit.","(298, 12)",,

","The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as the caper family, are a family of plants in the order Brassicales. As currently circumscribed, the family contains 33 genera and about 700 species. The largest genera are Capparis (about 150 species), Maerua (about 100 species), Boscia (37 species) and Cadaba (30 species). Taxonomy 
The Capparaceae have long been considered closely related to and have often been included in the Brassicaceae, the mustard family (APG, 1998), in part because both groups produce glucosinolate (mustard oil) compounds. Subsequent molecular studies support Capparaceae sensu stricto as paraphyletic with respect to the Brassicaceae. However Cleome and several related genera are more closely related to members of the Brassicaceae than to the other Capparaceae. These genera are now either placed in the Brassicaceae (as subfamily Clemoideae) or segregated into the Cleomaceae. Several more genera of the traditional Capparaceae are more closely related to other members of the Brassicales, and the relationships of several more remain unresolved. Based on morphological grounds and supported by molecular studies, the American species traditionally identified as Capparis have been transferred to resurrected generic names. Several new genera have also been recently described.","(226, 10)","The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as capers, is a family of flowering plants in the order Capitatae. The family is subdivided into two subfamilies, Capparinae and Capreolinae. There are about 165 genera and 2,000 species of capers, distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical climates.

The capers are a terrestrial or semiterrestrial family of flowering plants. They are herbs or small shrubs, with fleshy leaves that are either alternate or opposite and entire or toothed. The flowers are arranged in spikelike inflorescences, each with a few small sepals and petals. The fruit is a tiny Capsicum, typically a pepper but sometimes a fruit that resembles a tomato. The genus Capparis contains the typical capers (Capparis spinosa) and the related genus Ceratonia contains the false capers (Ceratonia siliqua), which have edible fruits resembling those of the true capers.

The capers are native to Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Asia Minor, and North America. They have been naturalized in many other parts of the world. They grow best in slightly alkaline soil with good drainage and moderate fertility.","(206, 11)","The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as

the North"") is a traditional Irish folk music genre that originated in the
northern regions of Ireland. It is characterized by its lively and energetic
rhythms, as well as its use of traditional instruments such as the fiddle,
flute, and bodhrán. The music is often associated with the Ulster region of
Ireland, where it has been passed down through generations of musicians.
One of the most famous examples of Ceol
Aduaidh is the song ""The Foggy Dew,"" which tells the story of the 1916 Easter
Rising in Ireland. The song was written by Robert Dwyer Joyce and first
performed in 1917. It has since become one of the most popular songs in the
Irish folk music tradition, and has been covered by numerous artists over the
years, including The Chieftains, The Clancy Brothers, and Sinead O'Connor.
Another important aspect of Ceol Adua
idh is its use of storytelling. Many of the songs in this genre tell stories
about Irish history, mythology, and folklore. For example, the song ""The
Maiden's Lament"" tells the story of a young woman who falls in love with a
soldier during the Irish War of Independence, only to have him killed in
battle. The song is a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by Irish
soldiers during the struggle for independence.
In recent years, there has been a resurgence
of interest in Ceol Aduadh among younger generations of Irish musicians. This
has led to the creation of new versions of traditional songs, as well as the
development of new songs that draw inspiration from the genre. For example,
the band Kodaline has released a number of songs that incorporate elements of
Ceol Aduadh, such as ""All I Want"" and ""High Hopes."" These songs have been
well-received by audiences both in Ireland and around the world, and have
helped to introduce a new generation of listeners to the rich musical heritage
of Ireland.
In conclusion, Ceol Aduah is an important
genre of Irish folk music that has played a significant role in shaping Irish
culture and identity. Its lively rhythms and storytelling traditions have
inspired generations of musicians, and continue to do so today. Whether you're
a fan of traditional Irish music or just looking to learn more about Irish
culture, there's no better place to start than with Ceol","(442, 17)",,

In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective
","In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that sees social behavior as an interactive product of the individual and the situation. In other words, it derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from social interaction, whereby subjectively held meanings are integral to explaining or understanding social behavior. This perspective studies the ways in which individuals shape, and are shaped by, society through their interactions. Interactionism thus argues that the individual is an active and conscious piece of the social-context system, rather than merely a passive object in their environment. It believes interactions to be guided by meanings that are attached to the self, to others with whom each individual interacts, and to situations of interaction; all of which are altered in interaction themselves. In this sense, interactionism may stand in contrast to studies of socialization, insofar as interactionism conceives individuals to influence groups at least as much as groups influence individuals.","(174, 6)","In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in human behaviour. It is a philosophical and methodological approach that began to develop in the 1940s and 1950s and has been influential in sociology, anthropology, and psychology.

Interactionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in human behaviour. It is a philosophical and methodological approach that began to develop in the 1940s and 1950s and has been influential in sociology, anthropology, and psychology. The basic idea is that humans are not just individual actors but are also members of social groups, which shapes their behaviour. Social interaction is thus seen as a key factor in understanding human behaviour.

Interactionism has a number of important implications for sociology. First, it emphasises the role of social norms and values in shaping behaviour.Second, it emphasises the importance of contextuality in understanding human behaviour. Finally, it stresses the importance of social interaction as a means of learning and understanding behaviour.

Interactionism has also had an important impact on the methodology of sociology. It has led to the development of social process theory and action research, two important methodological approaches within sociology.","(217, 11)","In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective
that emphasizes the importance of social interaction in shaping
individual behavior and society as a whole. It focuses on the
meaning that individuals attach to their social interactions and
the ways in which these meanings shape their actions and
perceptions. Interactionists argue that social reality is
constructed through the ongoing process of social interaction,
and that individuals actively participate in this process by
interpreting and responding to the actions of others.
Interactionism has its roots in the work of George Herbert
Mead, who developed the concept of the ""self"" as a product of
social interaction. Mead argued that individuals develop a sense
of self through their interactions with others, and that this
sense of self is shaped by the expectations and norms of the
society in which they live. Mead's work laid the foundation for
later interactionist theories, such as symbolic interactionism
and ethnomethodology.
Symbolic interactionism, developed by Herbert Blumer, focuses
on the ways in which individuals use symbols, such as language
and gestures, to communicate and make sense of their social
world. Blumer argued that individuals actively interpret and
respond to the symbols used by others, and that these
interpretations shape their actions and perceptions.
Ethnomethodology, developed by Harold Garfinkel, takes a more
sociological approach to interactionism, focusing on the ways in
which individuals use social rules and norms to make sense of
their social world. Garfinkel argued that individuals actively
participate in the construction of social reality through their
use of social rules and norms, and that these rules and norms
are constantly negotiated and renegotiated through social
interaction.
Interactionism has had a significant impact on the field of
sociology, particularly in the areas of social psychology and
micro-sociology. It has also influenced other fields, such as
anthropology and communication studies. Interactionism has been
used to explain a wide range of social phenomena, including
gender roles, race relations, and deviant behavior. It has also
been used to critique traditional sociological approaches that
focus on large-scale social structures and institutions, arguing
that these approaches fail to capture the complexity and
fluidity of social interaction.

","Moovalur Ramamirtham  (1883–1962) was a Tamil social reformer, author, and political activist of the Dravidian Movement, who worked for the abolition of the Devadasi system in the Madras Presidency. Born in Thiruvarur, she was brought up at Moovalur, a village near Mayiladhuthurai. She was the author of the 1936 novel Dasigalin Mosavalai alladhu madhi pettra minor (lit. Devadasis' web of deceit or the minor grown wise) which exposed the plight of the Devadasis. Originally a supporter of the nationalist Indian National Congress, she became a member of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement after Periyar left the Congress in 1925. In 1930, she supported Muthulakshmi Reddi's failed attempt to abolish the Devadasi system in the Presidency through legislation. She took part in the Anti-Hindi agitations of 1937-40 and in November 1938, was jailed for six weeks for participating in the agitations. The public awareness created by her novel and her continuous campaign to abolish the Devadasi system, were instrumental in the passage of the Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act or the Devadasi Abolition Bill, which outlawed the practice in 1947. In 1949, she parted ways with Periyar. She became a supporter of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a new party started by Periyar's protégé C. N. Annadurai. She remained a DMK supporter till her death in 1962.

He was a noted philologist and author of Tamil literature.

Moovalur Ramamirtham was born on 1883 in Moovalur, a village in Tiruchirappalli district, then in the Madras Presidency (now in Tamil Nadu, India). He received his early education at a local school and later studied at Madras University where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1907. He then travelled to England to continue his studies at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge where he obtained his Master of Arts degree in 1910 and Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1913, respectively.

Returning to India, Ramamirtham began teaching at the Government Arts College, Tiruchirappalli. In 1916, he was appointed professor of Tamil at the University of Madras where he remained until his retirement in 1956. He was also a visiting professor at universities in Australia, Canada, Europe and North America during this time.

Ramamirtham's early writings were on Tamil grammar and literature. However, it was his magnum opus, the twelve-volume Tamil Lexicon (1927–1957), that made him internationally known.

independence movement. Born in the village of Moovalur in Tamil Nadu,
Ramamirtham was deeply influenced by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi
and his philosophy of non-violent resistance. He joined the Indian
National Congress in 1920 and became actively involved in the
struggle for India's independence from British colonial rule.
One of Ramamirtham's most significant contributions to the
independence movement was his involvement in the Salt Satyagraha of
1930. Led by Mahatma Gandhi, this non-violent protest aimed to
challenge the British monopoly on salt production and highlight the
exploitative nature of colonial rule. Ramamirtham played a crucial
role in organizing and leading the Salt March in Tamil Nadu, which
saw thousands of people participating in peaceful protests against
the British salt tax.
In addition to his political activism, Ramamirtham was also a
dedicated social reformer. He worked tirelessly to improve the
living conditions of the poor and marginalized communities in Tamil
Nadu. He established schools, hospitals, and other social welfare
institutions to provide education and healthcare to those in need.
Ramamirtham's commitment to social justice and equality earned him
the respect and admiration of many, and he became a symbol of hope
and inspiration for the people of Tamil Nadu.

to work for the betterment of society. He served as a member of the
Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly and played a key role in drafting
the state's constitution. He also worked to promote interfaith
harmony and understanding, and was known for his efforts to bridge
the gap between different religious communities.

Tallgrass Beef Company is a Kansas-based beef
","Tallgrass Beef Company is a Kansas-based beef company that sells grass fed and grass finished beef. Tallgrass Beef became the first grass fed beef producer to sell steaks in Chicago in 2005 when Harry Caray’s Restaurant began selling Tallgrass Beef.  Its beef is sold via restaurants and grocery stores throughout the Midwest, East Coast, and Southeast, in addition to mail order. Tallgrass Beef Company raises some of its cattle on founder Bill Kurtis's Sedan, Kansas ranch.  Tallgrass also has a network of family farmers and ranchers who raise and finish grass fed cattle that fit the standards of the Tallgrass protocols. Beef production
Tallgrass' production process involves scientists employed by the company searching the United States for cattle whose genetics naturally causes the animal to fatten quickly and tenderly on grass. Beef producers have no databank of DNA with which to compare their findings, and so Tallgrass scientists use ultrasound technology to determine the tenderness of its potential herds.","(175, 7)","Tallgrass Beef Company is a Kansas-based beef producer.

Waterford city is situated in south eastern
","Waterford city is situated in south eastern Ireland, on the river Suir [pronounced Shure] about  from where the river enters the sea. Practically the entire city is built on the south bank of the river. The ""Old town"", now the business centre, clusters behind the broad quay-front on a low-lying strip of land left behind by a gentle loop of the river at this point. From this, the land rises sharply to the east and opposite to the west while remaining level in between. The eastern slopes are almost entirely occupied by private residential estates, while the western and southwestern prominences are largely given over to local council housing development. There are corresponding elevations on the north bank eastwards towards Christendom and westwards towards Mount Misery nothing. The rocks which form the base of the city all belong to the Palaeozoic Group – principally Ordovician shales underlying sandstone. On the East side of the city, the rock is crossed by an alluvial bank running N.E./S.W. At the cliffs alongside the banks of the River Suir, above Rice Bridge, inter-stratification of sharply-folded Ordovician Slates and Sandstone conglomerates may be clearly observed.","(211, 9)","Waterford city is situated in south eastern Ireland on the River Suir.

Burning Bush is a 2013 three-part miniseries
","Burning Bush  is a 2013 three-part miniseries created for HBO by Polish director Agnieszka Holland. Based on real characters and events, this haunting drama focuses on the personal sacrifice of a Prague history student, Jan Palach, who set himself on fire in 1969 in protest against the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia in the previous year. Dagmar Burešová, a young female lawyer, became part of his legacy by defending Palach's family in a trial against the communist government, a regime which tried to dishonour Palach’s sacrifice, a heroic action for the freedom of Czechoslovakia. The fight for freedom, for moral principles, self-sacrifice and protest in those desperate times led to the moral unification of a repressed nation, which twenty years later defeated the totalitarian regime. The anniversary of Jan Palach’s death inspired a new generation of students to start protests that led to the eventual fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, part of the eventual destruction of the Iron Curtain.","(179, 5)","Burning Bush  is a 2013 three-part Australian miniseries directed by Belinda McClaren. It is a historical drama set in the early years of the Australian settler colonies, and tells the story of a convict woman, Rose, who is transported to the new world in search of a new life.

Burning Bush was screened on Foxtel's History channel in Australia on 5, 9 and 12 October 2013. The miniseries was produced by Australian production company Madman Entertainment in association with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It was filmed on location in Victoria and New South Wales.

Burning Bush has been met with mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the miniseries has an approval rating of 50%, based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. 

The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave the series 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: ""This three-part saga about Rose (the talented newcomer played by Essie Davis) is absorbing enough that you'll forgive McClaren for not finding a more interesting or challenging subject."" 

IGN's Dan Stiles awarded the miniseries 8 out of 10 and called it ""a beautifully shot and well-acted period drama"".

The miniseries begins in 1968, when Czechoslovakia
was undergoing a period of political liberalization
known as the Prague Spring. However, the Soviet
Union invaded the country in August of that year,
putting an end to the reforms and leading to a
period of repression known as Normalization. The
miniseries follows Palach, a student at Charles

frustrated with the situation in his country and
decides to take drastic action. On January 16,
1969, Palach doused himself in gasoline and set
himself on fire in Wenceslas Square, a central
square in Prague. He died from his injuries two
days later, but his act of protest had a profound
impact on Czech society. His funeral was attended
by tens of thousands of people, and his death

Global aphasia is a severe form of
","Global aphasia is a severe form of nonfluent aphasia, caused by damage to the left side of the brain, that affects receptive and expressive language skills (needed for both written and oral language) as well as auditory and visual comprehension. Acquired impairments of communicative abilities are present across all language modalities, impacting language production, comprehension, and repetition. Patients with global aphasia may be able to verbalize a few short utterances and use non-word neologisms, but their overall production ability is limited. Their ability to repeat words, utterances, or phrases is also affected. Due to the preservation of the right hemisphere, an individual with global aphasia may still be able to express themselves through facial expressions, gestures, and intonation. This type of aphasia often results from a large lesion of the left perisylvian cortex. The lesion is caused by an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and is associated with damage to Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and insular regions which are associated with aspects of language. Signs and symptoms
It is most common for the onset of global aphasia to occur after a thrombotic stroke (at the trunk of the middle cerebral artery), with varying severity. The general signs and symptoms include the inability to understand, create, and repeat speech and language.  These difficulties also persist in reading, writing, and auditory comprehension abilities.
Verbal language typically consists of a few recognizable utterances and words (e.g., hello), overlearned phrases (e.g., how are you), and expletives (e.g., a curse word). However, those affected by global aphasia may express themselves using facial expressions, intonation, and gestures.  Extensive lexical (vocabulary) impairment is possible, resulting in an inability to read simple words or sentences. Global aphasia may be accompanied by weakness of the right side of the face and right hemiplegia (paralysis), but can occur with or without hemiparesis (weakness). Additionally, it is common for an individual with global aphasia to have one or more of the following additional impairments: apraxia of speech, alexia, pure word deafness, agraphia, facial apraxia, and depression.","(405, 15)","Global aphasia is a severe form of aphasia that affects all languages, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in producing spoken words and understanding spoken language.

There is no known cure for global aphasia, but there are treatments available that can help improve language skills.

The adults' diet consists of invertebrates and plantas well as plankton. They form large schools when foraging.  and they spawn in the tributaries and along shores of lakes on pebbles and gravel in surf zone.

The Prespa bleak, also known as Alburnus belvica, is a small freshwater lake located in the southeastern part of the Republic of Macedonia. The lake is the deepest of its kind in Europe and is home to a number of endemic animal and plant species. The Prespa bleak is an important Ramsar site, and has been designated a Wetland of International Importance.

The Prespa bleak lies in the southeastern part of Macedonia, close to the border with Kosovo. The lake occupies an area of 2.5 km² and has a maximum depth of 47 m. The surrounding terrain is hilly, with a few deep gorges. The climate is temperate and humid, with an average temperature of 10 °C and an annual rainfall of 400 mm.

The Prespa bleak was first explored by a team from the University of Zagreb in 1892. Its biological riches were first recognised in the 1920s, when it was discovered that the lake was home to a number of endemic animal and plant species. Since then, the Prespa bleak has been designated a Wetland of International Importance, and it has been used for research into water resources management.","(256, 12)","Alburnus belvica. the Prespa bleak, is a
species of ray-finned fish in the family Cyprinidae. It is
endemic to Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa in the Balkans. It is
threatened by overfishing and habitat loss.
The Prespa bleak is a small fish, growing to a
maximum length of about 10 cm (3.9 in). It has a slender body
and a pointed snout. The dorsal fin is located far back on the
body, and the caudal fin is forked. The scales are small and
smooth. The overall coloration is silvery, with a greenish
tint on the back and sides. The belly is white. The fins are
transparent, with the exception of the pectoral fins, which are
yellowish.
The diet of the Prespa bleak consists mainly of
zooplankton, such as copepods and cladocerans. It also feeds on
small insects and other invertebrates. The fish is an active
swimmer, using its fins to propel itself through the water. It
is a shoaling species, often seen in groups of up to several
hundred individuals. The Prespa bleak breeds in the spring and
summer, laying eggs on submerged vegetation or rocks. The eggs
are adhesive and stick to the substrate. The larvae hatch after
a few days and begin to feed on zooplankton. The fish reaches
sexual maturity at about two years of age.
The Prespa bleak is found only in Lake Ohrid and
Lake Prespa, two large lakes in the Balkans that are separated
by a narrow strip of land. The fish is endemic to these lakes,
meaning that it is found nowhere else in the world. The lakes
are oligotrophic, meaning that they are low in nutrients and
high in oxygen. This makes them ideal habitats for the Prespa
bleak, which requires clear, well-oxygenated water to survive.
The fish is threatened by a number of factors,
including overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Overfishing
is a major problem, as the fish is a popular food item in the
region. Habitat loss is also a concern, as the lakes are
shrinking due to climate change and human activities such as
irrigation and dam construction. Pollution is another threat,
as the lakes are vulnerable to runoff from agricultural and
industrial activities.

Rye is a seaside town in Greater
","Rye is a seaside town in Greater Melbourne on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, Australia. It is approximately 95 km south of Melbourne's central business district.

Its local government area is the Shire of Mornington Peninsula. Rye is in the traditional country of the Boon wurrung (Bunurong) people of the Kulin nation. History
Rye was proclaimed a town on 26 February 1861 and is partly in the parish of Wannaeue but mainly in the parish of Nepean, which is west of Government Road and Weeroona Street. The township went south to the southern boundary of the cemetery, with its east and west boundaries being Weir Street and Dundas Street. Suburban lots of 21 to 98 acres extended west to French St and south to a point just past the Golf Pde corner. Most of these suburban lots were bought by W.A.Blair, a Melbourne Lime Merchant.
He also received grants for much land in the parishes of Wannaeue and Nepean. His objective was to establish a monopoly, which was only rivalled by John Cain. Many who had been engaged in the production of lime, such as Nathan Page, Tom Bennett, Edward Russell, Harold Bainbridge and Spunner, were dispossessed of their kilns by Blair in about 1867. Lime could be quarried throughout the area west of Boneo Road. Many golf courses and the Peninsula Hot Springs are on the sites of Limeburners' properties between Browns and Limestone Roads. An excellent reproduction of a lime kiln can be seen on the foreshore just east of White Cliff. They were built into the side of a hill so that firewood and napped limestone could be loaded from above.","(344, 17)","Rye is a seaside town in Greater Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

A military officer, he came to power after a military coup in 1969. Establishing a one-party state, with his Sudanese Socialist Union as the sole legal political entity in the country, Nimeiry pursued socialist and Pan-Arabist policies and close collaboration with Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. In 1971 Nimeiry survived a pro-Soviet coup attempt, after which he forged an alliance with Mao Zedong of China (who provided him with significant military and economic assistance), and, eventually, with the United States as well. In 1972 he signed the Addis Ababa Agreement, ending the First Sudanese Civil War. In his last years in power he also adopted aspects of Islamism, and in 1983 he imposed Sharia law throughout the country, precipitating the Second Sudanese Civil War.

It served as a first major campaign to raise public awareness of the need for international agreements on controls for opium and its derivatives. Description of the petition
Addressed to all rulers and nations of the world, this petition to adopt prohibition was written by the American Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) president Frances Willard in 1884. It was carried across the world by at least four World WCTU missionaries who gathered signatures of nearly eight million people in more than fifty countries. The signatures can be categorized in three basic sections: signatures of individual women, written endorsements of men, and attestations of leaders of groups that had endorsed the petition. The signed petitions from the U.S. (over 750,000) were sent to Mrs. Rebecca C. Shuman in Evanston, Illinois who trimmed and mounted them on white muslin, one-half yard in width and bound with red ribbon on one side and blue ribbon on the other. Signed petitions from Great Britain (350,000 signatories) came in already mounted on cloth in time for presentation to the U.S. president in February 1885.

The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection was started in late 2017 by a coalition of individuals concerned about the rise of nationalism and xenophobia around the world. The petition called for the protection of multilingualism and the promotion of linguistic diversity. The goal of the petition was to raise awareness about the importance of preserving and promoting multilingualism, and to call on governments to take action to protect languages and cultures from discrimination and violence.

The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection received a significant amount of support from around the world. The petition was signed by over 100,000 people from over 100 countries, including prominent figures such as Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison and actor George Clooney. The petition also received support from organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, which called on governments to take action to protect languages and cultures from discrimination and violence.

In response to the widespread support the Polyglot Petition for Home Protection has received, several governments have announced plans to take action to protect languages and cultures from discrimination and violence. For example, the French government announced plans to create a new Ministry dedicated to protecting multilingualism and linguistic diversity, while the Italian government announced plans to create a new ministry specifically devoted to protecting minority language rights.","(275, 10)","The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection was
a petition signed by over 100,000 people in the United States during the early 20th century. The petition called for the establishment of a national language policy that would protect English as the official language of the country.
The petition was initiated by a group of English-only advocates who were concerned about the growing number of non-English speakers in the United States. They believed that the use of multiple languages in the country was leading to confusion and division, and that it was necessary to establish a single, official language to promote unity and cohesion.
The petition gained significant support from various groups and individuals across the country, including politicians, business leaders, and religious organizations. It was presented to Congress in 1919, where it was met with mixed reactions. While some members of Congress supported the idea of an official language, others argued that it was unnecessary and potentially divisive.
Despite the lack of legislative action, the petition had a significant impact on public opinion and helped to shape the debate around language policy in the United States for decades to come. Today, the issue of an official language continues to be a topic of debate, with some advocating for English-only policies and others arguing for the preservation of linguistic diversity.","(237, 9)",,

Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained
","Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained in the lands around the Black Sea, especially in Crimea. They were the least-impactful on the fate of Europe and the longest-lasting of the Gothic communities. Their existence is well attested through the ages though the exact period when they ceased to exist as a distinct culture is unknown; as with the Goths in general, they may have been diffused with the surrounding peoples. In the Fourth Turkish letter by Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, they are described as ""a warlike people, who to this day inhabit many villages"" though in the 5th century, Theodoric the Great failed to rouse Crimean Goths to support his war in Italy. At the time, it was customary to refer to a wide range of Germanic tribes as ""Goths"", so the exact ethnic origin of the Germanic peoples in Crimea is a subject of debate. Aside from textual reports of the existence of the Goths in Crimea, both first and second hand, from as early as 850, numerous archaeological examples also exist, including the ruins of the former capital city of the Crimean Goths: Doros, or Mangup as it is now known. On top of this, there are numerous articles of jewelry, weaponry, shields, buttons, pins, and small personal artifacts on display in museums in Crimea and in the British Museum which have led to a better understanding of the Gothic Kingdom.","(265, 7)","Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained in Crimea after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. They are thought to have assimilated with the locals, and their descendants are today known as Crimean Tatars.

The Greuthungi-Gothic tribes were a group of Germanic people who lived in what is now southern Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus in the 4th century AD. They were closely related to the Goths, who lived in present-day Germany and Denmark. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, the Greuthungi-Gothic tribes remained in Crimea, which was part of the Eastern Roman Empire.

The Crimean Goths were closely related to the Ostrogoths, who lived in present-day Italy and Spain. The Crimean Goths were also closely related to the Visigoths, who lived in present-day France and Portugal.

The Crimean Goths were initially defeated by the Byzantine Empire, but they later defeated the Byzantine Empire and became independent rulers. The Crimean Goths ruled Crimea for more than 400 years. The Crimean Goths were eventually conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1475 AD.","(195, 10)","Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained

Goths played a significant role in the history of the region,
and their legacy can still be seen today.
The Crimean Goths were descendants of the Greuthungi-
Gothic tribes who migrated to the Black Sea region in the
3rd century AD. They settled in the Crimean Peninsula, which
was then part of the Roman Empire. The Crimean Goths
adopted many aspects of Roman culture, including their
language, religion, and customs. However, they also retained
many of their own cultural traditions, such as their distinctive
dress, music, and art.
In the 4th century AD, the Crimean Goths came into conflict
with the Huns, a nomadic tribe from Central Asia. The Huns
invaded the Crimean Peninsula and defeated the Crimean
Goths in a series of battles. Many Crimean Goths fled to the
Roman Empire, where they were welcomed as allies against
the Huns. However, some Crimean Goths remained in the
Crimean Peninsula, where they continued to live under
Hunnic rule.
After the fall of the Roman Empire in the West in 476 AD,
the Crimean Goths found themselves under the rule of the
Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine
Empire. The Byzantines recognized the importance of the
Crimean Goths as a buffer against the Huns and other
nomadic tribes, and they allowed them to maintain their
autonomy and cultural traditions.
The Crimean Gothic language was closely related to the
other Gothic languages spoken in Europe at the time, such as
the Visigothic and Ostrogothic languages. However, it also
contained many unique features that set it apart from other
Gothic languages. For example, the Crimean Gothic language
used a different alphabet than the other Gothic languages,
which was based on the Greek alphabet.
The Crimean Goth culture was characterized by a strong
sense of community and family. They lived in small villages

The viola da Terceira (also viola Terceirense)
","The  viola da Terceira (also viola Terceirense) is a stringed musical instrument of the guitar family, from the Portuguese islands of the archipelago of the Azores, associated with the island of Terceira. History
The viola and other string instruments were brought during the Portuguese maritime expansion to the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde, Brazil and other locales, becoming common in the populations. Due to its importance in Portuguese music it likely arrived in Angola, Goa and Macau, and as far as Hawaii by the 19th century, where it became the forerunner of the ukulele. These early cordophones, the violas, had characteristics identical to the modern instruments, and great importance along the Iberian Peninsula, where it appeared in iconography, poems and diverse literature. The chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso, who identified it as just a ""Viola"", suggested that it first arrived in the Azores in the second half of the 19th century, brought the first settlers. There is little documentation that dates the arrival of the Portuguese Violas de Arame in the islands of the Azores.","(199, 6)","The  viola da Terceira (also viola da gamba, viola da quarta or viola da quinta) is a bowed string instrument belonging to the violin family. It was formerly known as the viola da gamba de quarta corda, because the fourth string of the viola da gamba is tuned a fourth lower than the other strings. The name ""viola da Terceira"" was introduced in the 18th century. The viola da Terceira is commonly used in classical music, chamber music and as a solo instrument.

The viola da Terceira is generally tuned in fifths, GDAE (Guitar tuning). Unlike the violin, which has four strings in three courses (E, A, D), the viola da Terceira has five strings in four courses. The lowest string is G, the next D, then A, followed by E and finally G. This configuration gives it a brighter sound than the violin and enables it to be played more easily in higher positions on the keyboard.

The viola da Terceira was first constructed around 1550 by Antonio Stradivari and his sons Giuseppe and Antonio. It became one of Stradivari's most popular and renowned instruments, and many of his violas are still extant. The viola da Terceira was often used by composer Antonio Vivaldi and performers like Antonio Caldara and Giovanni Battista Viotti.","(245, 10)","The viola da Terceira (also viola Terceirense)

It is believed to have been brought to the island
by Portuguese settlers in the 15th century,
and it has since become an integral part of the island's cultural heritage.
The viola da terceira is a small, four-stringed instrument
that is played with a bow.
It is similar in size and shape to a violin,
but it has a unique sound that is distinct from that of other stringed instruments.
The instrument is typically made of wood,
and it is often decorated with intricate carvings and inlays.
One of the most distinctive features of the viola de terceira
is its use of gut strings,
which give the instrument a warm, rich tone.
This is in contrast to modern stringed instruments,
which typically use steel or synthetic strings.
The viola de Terceira is used in a variety of musical genres,
including folk music, classical music, and popular music.
It is particularly popular in the Azores,
where it is often used in traditional dances and festivals.
The instrument has also gained popularity outside of the Azores,
and it is now played by musicians around the world.
In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the viola de Tercera,
and many musicians are working to preserve and promote the instrument's unique sound and cultural significance.","(268, 11)",,
