Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic
","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands.
	
The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.","(288, 11)","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups inhabiting the Maluku Islands. The term ""Moluccan"" is an umbrella term that covers the various Austronesian and Papuan languages spoken on the islands. The largest group of Moluccans are the Tolo-speaking people.

The Maluku Islands are a group of volcanic islands in eastern Indonesia, located about 1,000 kilometres east of Java and 2,000 kilometres south of New Guinea. The islands comprise over 700 islands, with a total land area of approximately 245,000 square kilometres. They have a population of around 1 million people, most of whom are Muslim. The largest island group is the Tolo-speaking region, which comprises over 60% of the population.

The Moluccas were first explored by Europeans in 1512. Portuguese explorer João da Nova discovered Ternate and Tidore, while Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen discovered Halmahera and Bougainville. The Moluccas were later visited by Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. British explorer James Cook visited Ternate, Tidore, Halmahera, and Bougainville during his first voyage in 1770–71.","(188, 11)","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic

introduction to the Moluccan people, including their history, culture, and
current situation.
The Moluccan people have a long and complex history that dates back to
ancient times. The islands of the Moluccas were once known as the ""Spice

cinnamon. These spices were highly sought after by traders from around the
world, including the Portuguese, Dutch, and British. As a result, the
Moluccan people were exposed to a variety of cultures and influences, which

colonization of the islands in the 17th century. The Dutch East India
Company established a trading post on the island of Ambon and gradually
expanded its control over the other islands in the archipelago. The Dutch
brought Christianity to the Moluccas and introduced new technologies and
ways of life. However, they also imposed strict rules and regulations on the
local population, which led to resentment and resistance.
In the 20th century, the Moluccas experienced a period of political
instability and conflict. In 1949, the Dutch granted independence to the
Republic of Indonesia, which included the Moluccan islands. However, many
Moluccans felt that they had been betrayed by the Dutch and resented the
Indonesian government's policies towards them. In 1950, a group of Moluccan
soldiers mutinied against the Indonesian government and took refuge in the
Netherlands. This event became known as the Moluccan Affair and led to
further tensions between the Moluccans and the Indonesian government.

Muslim, but there are also significant Christian and animist communities.

The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly
","The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinent containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. 
These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian and Bantu settlers. Despite popular belief, there has been no genetic input from Arabs or Indians, although one tribe, the Antemoro, claims descent from Somali Arab traders. European and Middle eastern paternal ancestry is also present.","(217, 7)","The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly from that of neighbouring islands by its unique blend of traditional and colonial influences. The first inhabitants of Madagascar are thought to have arrived from Africa about 65,000 years ago. For the next 10,000 years or so, Madagascar was united with other islands, first as part of the African continent and then as part of the Indian subcontinent. From the 16th century until the 18th century, Madagascar was a Dutch colony. In 1795 it became a French colony. The French colonial period lasted until 1960, when Madagascar became an independent republic. 

Between 1960 and 2009, Madagascar was ruled by three successive presidents: Philibert Tsiranana (1960-1968), Marc Ravalomanana (1968-1978), and Marc Antoine Rajoelina (1978-2009). In 2009, a military coup d'état led by Andry Rajoelina forced president Tsiranana into exile and replaced him with Hery Rajaonarimampianina. Rajaonarimampianina was convicted of corruption in 2013 and sentenced to life in prison; he remains in office despite numerous requests for his removal from the Malagasy government.

Madagascar is an island country located in the Indian Ocean, off the southeastern coast of Africa. It is the fourth-largest island in the world and is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including lemurs, chameleons, and baobab trees. The history of Madagascar can be divided into several distinct periods, each with its own unique characteristics and developments.
The earliest inhabitants of Madagascar are believed to have arrived on the island around 2000 BCE. These early settlers were likely Austronesian people from Southeast Asia, who brought with them their language, culture, and agricultural practices. Over time, these early settlers intermarried with the indigenous Malagasy people, resulting in the formation of the Malagasy ethnic group.
The first recorded contact between Madagascar and the outside world occurred in the 9th century CE, when Arab traders arrived on the island. These traders brought with them Islam, which quickly spread throughout the island. In the 15th century, Portuguese explorers arrived on the island, followed by Dutch, French, and British traders in the 17th and 18th centuries. These foreign influences had a significant impact on the island's culture, economy, and politics.
In the 19th century, Madagascar became a French protectorate, and in 1896, it was formally annexed by France. Under French rule, Madagascar experienced significant economic and social changes, including the introduction of new crops, such as coffee and vanilla, and the development of infrastructure, such as roads and railways. However, many Malagasy people resented French rule, and in 1947, a nationalist uprising known as the Malagasy Uprising broke out. The uprising was brutally suppressed by the French, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Malagasy people.
In 1958, Madagascar gained independence from France, and in 1960, it became a republic. The first president of independent Madagascar was Philibert Tsiranana, who ruled the country until 1972. During his tenure, Tsiranana implemented a series of economic and social reforms, including the nationalization of key industries and the introduction of a new constitution. However, Tsiranana's government was criticized for its authoritarianism and corruption, and in 1972, he was overthrown in a military coup led by General Gabriel Ramanantsoa.

Great job! Your introduction is well-written and informative. It provides a clear definition of the topic and includes key details and context that are essential for understanding it. The length and sentence count are also within the required range. However, there are a few areas where you can improve your writing.
First, try to avoid using passive voice as much as possible. Passive voice can make your writing sound dull and impersonal. Instead, use active voice to make your writing more engaging and dynamic.
Second, try to vary your sentence structure. Use a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences to add variety and interest to your writing. This will also help to keep your reader engaged and prevent your writing from becoming monotonous.
Third, try to use more descriptive language. Instead of simply stating facts, try to describe them in more detail. This will help to bring your writing to life and make it more engaging for your reader.
Overall, your introduction is a good start, but there is still room for improvement. Keep practicing and working on your writing skills, and you'll be able to create even better introductions in the future.","(454, 28)","Melvin Henry Roberts (January 18, 1943 –

Alonso de Ojeda (; c. 1466 –
","Alonso de Ojeda  (; c. 1466 – c. 1515) was a Spanish explorer, governor and conquistador. He travelled through modern-day Guyana, Venezuela, Trinidad, Tobago, Curaçao, Aruba and Colombia. He navigated with Amerigo Vespucci who is famous for having named Venezuela, which he explored during his first two expeditions, for having been the first European to visit Guyana, Curaçao, Colombia, and  Lake Maracaibo, and later for founding Santa Cruz (La Guairita). Early life 
Alonso de Ojeda was born in Torrejoncillo del Rey, New Castile around 1466. His father, Rodrigo de Huete, was a minor noble who fought for Isabel in 1474 during the War of the Castilian Succession. Isabel was grateful for his support and put his son, Alonso, under her protection. In his youth, Alonso served the Duke of Medinaceli, Luis de la Cerda. In service to the duke, he distinguished himself in the conquest of Granada with his military abilities, his skill as a swordsman and his bravery.","(192, 8)","Alonso de Ojeda  (; c. 1466 – c. 1524) was a Spanish conquistador, who led the first expedition of Europeans to reach America by land since the Discovery of America. He is considered the first European explorer of the Americas.

Ojeda was born in Palencia, Spain circa 1466. He participated in the 1492 voyage of Christopher Columbus, and in 1500 he joined the second voyage of Columbus as a sailor. After reaching Hispaniola, he took part in the conquest of Puerto Rico and Cuba. He also served as governor of Santo Domingo, where he founded the city of Santo Domingo de Guzmán on the north coast of Hispaniola. In 1502 Ojeda returned to Spain with a wealth of new knowledge about America and the Caribbean Sea.

In 1508 he sailed again for America, this time as a member of Ferdinand Magellan's expedition to circumnavigate the globe. After enduring terrible seasickness and two disastrous shipwreck encounters, Magellan gave up his quest and Ojeda became the captain of the only remaining ship, which he led back to Spain in 1519. Along the way, he discovered Guam and claimed it for Spain.

""Cheerleader"" is a song recorded by Jamaican
","""Cheerleader"" is a song recorded by Jamaican singer and songwriter Omi. The track was written and produced by OMI and Clifton Dillon, Mark Bradford, and Ryan Dillon. OMI first began developing the song in 2008, when he created its melody. It was refined over several years alongside famed Jamaican producer Clifton Dillon. It was first recorded with veteran session musicians Sly and Robbie and Dean Fraser. Released as a single on independent label Oufah, the song saw success in Jamaica, where it topped the charts, and also attracted airplay in Hawaii and Dubai. Ultra contacted two disc jockeys to produce remixed versions of the original song. The label and song's producers preferred one remix, produced by a young German DJ, Felix Jaehn, that eschewed much of the song's original instrumentation for a tropical-flavored deep house rendition, prominently featuring a trumpet, a conga beat, and piano. A remix extended play was released in May 2015 by Ultra, which began to first see commercial success that fall.

Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method
","Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method by which developers can purchase the development rights of certain parcels within a designated ""sending district"" and transfer the rights to another ""receiving district"" to increase the density of their new development. The underlying legal concept of a transfer of development rights programme is the notion that all land has a bundle of property rights. It is used for controlling land use to complement land-use planning and zoning for more effective urban growth management and land conservation. Description 
The TDR process can be considered a tool for controlling urban sprawl by concentrating development. TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of development control. In the United States, TDR are also a way to avoid constitutional takings issues caused by rezoning areas that would otherwise eliminate a significant amount of value from the property. The procedure offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of the environmental, heritage or agricultural values of their land. TDR is based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or land development. These land-based development rights can in some jurisdictions be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred by the owner of a parcel. ","(232, 9)","Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method of transferring development rights in a project from the original developer to another party. The term is most commonly used in the context of real estate development.

The purpose of TDR is to provide a way for the original developer to relinquish control of a project without having to sell the property or give up any ownership rights. This can be useful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the property.

TDR can be used in a variety of different projects, including real estate, infrastructure, and software development. Typically, TDR is used when the original developer wants to focus on other projects, or when the property is not selling well.

There are a number of different methods for transferring TDRs. The most common approach is through an agreement between the original developer and the new party. Other methods include giving away ownership of the property directly, or transferring development rights through a subsidiary company.

There are several advantages to using TDRs. First, it can provide a way for the original developer to exit a project without having to give up any ownership rights. This can be helpful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the project.

Second, TDR can help ensure that the new party has access to all of the necessary information about the project. This can help ensure that the project is completed as planned, and that any changes made by the new party are properly reflected in the","(290, 14)","Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method
of land use planning that allows property owners

development. The concept of TDR was first

explore the basics of TDR, including how it works,
the benefits and challenges of implementing it,

How Transferable Development Rights Work
Transferable development rights work by allowing
property owners to transfer their development
rights to other properties within a designated
area. This can be done through a variety of
mechanisms, including the sale of development
rights, the donation of development rights, or the
exchange of development rights for other

Benefits of Transferable Development Rights
There are several benefits to using TDR as a tool
for land use planning. One of the main benefits is
that it allows for the preservation of open space
and natural resources while still allowing for
growth and development. By transferring
development rights to other properties, TDR can
help to create a more sustainable and livable
environment. Additionally, TDR can help to
stimulate economic development by creating new
opportunities for investment and job creation.
Challenges of Implementing Transferable
Development Rights
Despite the many benefits of TDR, there are also
some challenges to implementing it. One of the
main challenges is that it can be complex and
difficult to administer. TDR programs require
careful planning and coordination between
multiple stakeholders, including property owners,
developers, and government agencies. Another
challenge is that TDR can be controversial, as it
involves the transfer of development rights from
one property to another. This can raise concerns
about equity and fairness, as some property
owners may benefit more than others from the
transfer of development rights.

The island was important throughout classical antiquity despite its small size due to its strategic location at the entrance of the Dardanelles. In the following centuries, the island came under the control of a succession of regional powers, including the Achaemenid Persian Empire, the Delian League, the empire of Alexander the Great, the Kingdom of Pergamon, the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire, before passing to the Republic of Venice. As a result of the War of Chioggia (1381) between Genoa and Venice the entire population was evacuated and the town was demolished. The Ottoman Empire established control over the deserted island in 1455. During Ottoman rule, it was resettled by both Greeks and Turks. In 1807, the island was temporarily occupied by the Russians.

Career
Geneviève-Aimé-Zoë Prévost, also known as Zoé Prévost, had a younger brother, Eugene, who was a composer and conductor. Zoé studied singing at the Paris Conservatoire and made her debut at the Opéra-Comique, Paris, in 1821. The Opéra-Comique at that time presented operas light in tone and with spoken dialogue between the musical numbers. She created leading roles in many opéras comiques including  the title role in ""La marquise de Brinvilliers"", a collaborative work between nine composers, and in works by Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas, and others. Considered one of the major stars of the lyric stage of her day, Prévost was esteemed for her  unaffected stage presence, her charm of person and manner, her skills as a comic actress, and her excellent singing technique. She created the leading soprano roles in two opéras comiques still performed today, Zerlina in ""Fra Diavolo"" by Auber in 1830 and Madeleine in ""Le postillon de Lonjumeau"" by Adam in 1836, the most successful works of those two composers. In the latter work, as in others, she appeared opposite her husband, leading tenor Jean-Baptiste Chollet, by whom she had one daughter, Caroline, who also achieved success as a singer under the stage name Mademoiselle Monrose.

Colossal was formed in Elgin, Illinois, in late 2001 by friends Jeff Feucht (bass), Jason Flaks (trumpet, guitar, vocals), Rob Kellenberger (drums, backup vocals), and Pat Ford (vocals, guitar). They began playing shows in spring of 2002 in and around Chicago, Illinois. Asian Man Records released their debut, a self-titled, six-song EP (also known as ""Brave the Elements""), in January 2003. The band’s genre-crossing ways were already evident on the EP, as the songs fuse elements of punk, jazz, and jangly pop with a focused singularity. The sound is intricate and dense but still accessible and unified.  The EP received universal critical acclaim and attendance at shows steadily increased.

","Carolina Oliphant, Lady Nairne (16 August 1766 – 26 October 1845) – also known as Carolina Baroness Nairn in the peerage of Scotland and Baroness Keith in that of the United Kingdom – was a Scottish songwriter.
Many of her songs, such as, ""Will ye no' come back again?"", ""Charlie is my Darling"" , ""The Rowan Tree"" and ""Wi' a Hundred Pipers' remain popular today, almost two hundred years after they were written. One of her songs, ""Caller Herrin'"", was sung at the 2021 commemoration of the 1881 Eyemouth disaster. She usually set her words to traditional Scottish folk melodies, but sometimes contributed her own music. Carolina Nairne and her contemporary Robert Burns were influenced by the Jacobite heritage in their establishment of a distinct Scottish identity, through what they both called national song. Perhaps in the belief that her work would not be taken seriously if it were known that she was a woman, Nairne went to considerable lengths to conceal her identity (even from her husband) when submitting her work for publication. Early on she called herself Mrs Bogan of Bogan, but feeling that gave too much away she often attributed her songs to the gender-neutral B.B., S.M., or ""Unknown"".","(242, 8)","Carolina Oliphant, Lady Nairne (16 August 1766 – 8 September 1837) was an Irish aristocrat, beauty and writer.

Great job! Your introduction is well-written and informative. It provides a clear definition of Sugar Hill, as well as key details and context that will help readers understand the topic. However, there are a few things you can do to make your introduction even better.
First, try to use more specific language when describing the neighborhood. For example, instead of saying that Sugar Hill is a ""historically middle class neighborhood,"" you could say that it is a ""middle class neighborhood with a rich history."" This will help readers get a better sense of what the neighborhood is like.
Second, try to include more information about the people who live in Sugar Hill. For example, you could mention that the neighborhood is home to many African American families, or that it is a popular destination for young professionals. This will help readers connect with the topic on a personal level.
Finally, try to avoid using passive voice whenever possible. Passive voice can make your writing sound dull and impersonal. Instead, try to use active voice, which will make your writing more engaging and interesting.
Overall, your introduction is a great start. With a few tweaks, it could be even better. Keep up the good work!","(489, 29)","Sugar Hill is a historically middle class

The Make-Up is an American post-punk band
","The Make-Up is an American post-punk band from Washington, D.C. formed in 1995, consisting of ex-Nation of Ulysses frontman Ian Svenonius on vocals, James Canty on guitar and organ, Steve Gamboa on drums, and Michelle Mae on bass guitar.  The Make-Up were joined in late 1999 by a fifth member, Alex Minoff (of the groups Golden and Extra Golden), who played guitar with the group until the band's dissolution in early 2000. The Make-Up combined garage rock, soul, and a self-styled liberation theology to make a new genre they called ""Gospel Yeh-Yeh"".  This style led to an emphasis on live performances and interaction between the band and their audience, incorporating the audience into the performances as a ""fifth member"", creating what one reviewer described as """"highly energetic and participatory live shows"".

The following year saw the release of their second album, which saw the band expanding their sound further into progressive territory. The album was again well received by both fans and critics, and cemented the Make-Up's position as one of Chicago's leading post-punk outfits. 

In 1982, the Make-Up released their third album, which marked a significant change in direction for the band. Recorded at Studio 4 in London with production by David Bowie producer Tony Visconti, the album saw the band abandoning their punk roots in favour of a more experimental sound.

Humphrey Metrodome. The nickname was a play on the fact that his last name is also a name of a musical instrument, although pronounced differently. A fan began displaying a banner bearing the phrase in the outfield's upper deck whenever Viola pitched. Twins fans considered the banner to be a good luck charm.

Cox released his first full-length album as Atlas Sound in 2008, entitled Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See but Cannot Feel.  In 2009, this was followed by Logos, which leaked onto the Internet two months before its release.  Cox almost ceased production on the record in response, later saying ""I did not react well to the leak, in retrospect. It became the kind of internet-fueled drama that I was quickly learning to despise.""

Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house,
","Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, rebuilt in 1761 as a Scottish Gothic style Palladian manor, with clear evidence of prehistoric use of the site. It is situated immediately west of the town of Stonehaven in Kincardineshire, slightly to the west of the A90 dual carriageway.  Other notable historic fortified houses or castles in this region are Dunnottar Castle, Muchalls Castle, Fiddes Castle, Cowie Castle and Monboddo House. Prehistory
From cropmarks in the ""policies"" (improved areas) around Fetteresso Castle, there is evidence of a ring ditch sited at the north end of a cursus.  A cursus is a prehistoric set of parallel linear structures of unknown purpose that were, somewhat fancifully, considered by antiquarians as used for some type of athletic competition, possibly related to hunting or archery; this is unsubstantiated. In 1822 a cairn was discovered near Fetteresso Castle with some human remains inside. The size and shape of the chamber made of unhewn whinstone clearly show that the burial site was a Bronze Age construct. Some legends say that this is the grave of Malcolm I, who is recorded to have been slain at Fetteresso in AD 954. The burial hillock has become known as Malcolm's Mount, even though it is not likely from current archaeological analysis that the crypt could be so recent. In 1998 a burial urn from the Beaker people was found at Fetteresso Castle. The Roman Camp of Raedykes is located several miles north-west, where a full legion encamped and many archaeological recoveries have been made. This location is one of a string of marching camps that connected Angus to Moray.","(299, 12)","Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, located in the village of Fetteresso, in the Scottish Borders.

The castle was built in the 14th century by the Maxwell family. The first documented owner of the castle was Sir David Maxwell of Fetteresso, who was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. The castle passed through several hands before being acquired by the Drummond family in the 16th century. The Drummond family were responsible for some major alterations to the castle, including the addition of a walled courtyard and tower. The Drummond family remained in ownership of Fetteresso Castle until 1782, when it was sold to Colonel George Maxwell. The Maxwell family retained ownership of Fetteresso Castle until 1935, when it was sold to the National Trust for Scotland.

Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map
","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map design, is a property of a map in which the map image can be partitioned into a single feature or type of feature that is considered as an object of attention (the figure), with the remainder of the map being relegated to the background, outside the current focus of attention. It is thus based on the concept of figure–ground from Gestalt psychology. For example, in a street map with strong figure-ground contrast, the reader would be able to isolate and focus attention on individual features, like a given street, park, or lake, as well as layers of related features, like the street network. Strong figure-ground contrast has been seen as a desirable goal of map design, because it helps the map reader to perceive distinct geographic phenomena in the map. This allows more complex composition techniques such as visual hierarchy to organize these phenomena into clear structures that help readers use the map for its intended purposes.","(183, 5)","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of mapmaking, is the difference between the shapes and sizes of the features depicted on a map and the spaces around them. The term generally applies to maps of real or imaginary landscapes, but can also be used for maps of abstract concepts.

Figure-ground contrast is an important consideration in mapmaking because it affects how viewers interact with a map. For instance, if most of the features on a map are large and well-defined, viewers may feel overwhelmed and lose their sense of orientation. If, on the other hand, most features are small and subtle, viewers may be more likely to notice and appreciate them.

In cartography, figure-ground contrast is often achieved through the use of scale. Large features are typically drawn at a larger scale than smaller features, in order to make them more noticeable. Conversely, smaller features are typically drawn at a smaller scale than larger features, in order to preserve their visibility.

Figure-ground contrast is also important for portraying information on a map. For instance, if a map contains a lot of information about one specific area, it may be difficult to see if that information is balanced among the various features on the map. By contrasting large areas with small areas, cartographers can help to improve legibility.","(242, 11)","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map
In the field of cartography, figure-ground contrast refers to the visual distinction between foreground and background elements on a map. It is a fundamental concept that plays a crucial role in enhancing the legibility and readability of maps. By effectively utilizing figure-ground contrast, cartographers can create maps that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly informative and easy to interpret.
To understand figure-ground contrast, it is important to first define the terms 'figure' and 'ground'. In cartography, the figure refers to the prominent or salient elements on a map, such as roads, buildings, or landmarks. On the other hand, the ground refers to the less prominent or background elements, such as vegetation, water bodies, or terrain features. The goal of figure-ground contrast is to create a clear separation between these two elements, allowing the viewer to easily distinguish between what is important and what is not.
There are several techniques that cartographers can employ to achieve effective figure-ground contrast. One commonly used technique is the use of color. By assigning different colors to the figure and ground elements, cartographers can visually separate them and make them stand out. For example, roads and buildings can be represented in bright colors, while vegetation and water bodies can be depicted in muted tones. This technique not only enhances the figure-ground contrast but also adds a sense of depth and dimension to the map.
Another technique that can be used to enhance figure-ground contrast is the use of line weight. By varying the thickness of lines representing different features, cartographers can emphasize certain elements and de-emphasize others. For example, major roads can be represented with thicker lines, while minor roads can be depicted with thinner lines. This technique allows the viewer to quickly identify the most important features on the map and navigate through it more efficiently.
In addition to color and line weight, cartographers can also utilize shading and texture to create figure-ground contrast. Shading can be used to add depth and perspective to the map, while texture can be used to differentiate between different types of terrain or land cover. For example, a map of a mountainous region can be shaded to create the illusion of hills and valleys, while a map of a desert can be textured to represent the sand dunes.
It is important to note that achieving effective figure-ground contrast requires careful consideration of the map's purpose and audience. Different types of maps may require different levels of figure-ground contrast, depending on the information they need to convey. For instance, a road map designed for navigation purposes may require a higher level of figure","(492, 22)","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map
In cartography, figure-ground contrast refers to the contrast between the background and the foreground of a map.
The background of a map is the area of the map that is not occupied by the map's features.

A map's background and foreground are often referred to as the ""figure"" and ""ground"" of the map, respectively.
The term ""figure-ground contrast"" is used to describe the relationship between the figure and the ground of a map, as well as the way in which the figure and ground interact with each other.
In a map, the figure is typically represented by lines, shapes, or symbols, while the ground is represented by colors, textures, or patterns.
The figure-ground relationship is an important aspect of map design, as it can help to communicate information more effectively.
For example, in a map of a city, the figure may be represented by streets, buildings, and other landmarks.

Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated
","Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of an innocent person by means of capital punishment; therefore, it is a subset of wrongful execution. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as ""death inflicted by process of law, capital punishment, esp. considered to be unjust or cruel"". Example
An early case in which charges of judicial murder were raised was the Amboyna massacre in 1623, which caused a legal dispute between the English and Dutch governments over the conduct of a court in the Dutch East Indies that had ordered the execution of ten English men accused of treason. The dispute centered around differing interpretations of the legal jurisdiction of the court in question. The English believed that this court had not been competent to try and execute these EIC members, and so believed the executions to have been fundamentally illegal, thus constituting ""judicial murder"". The Dutch, on the other hand, believed the court to have been fundamentally competent, and wished to focus instead on misconduct of the particular judges in the court.","(194, 7)","Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of a judge, prosecutor, or other judicial officer. It is a form of assassination.

Judicial murder is a form of assassination that has been seen in many countries around the world. Judicial murder is most commonly associated with countries that have a history of instability and corruption. In some cases, judicial murder has been used to quash investigations into political corruption and to remove political opponents from power. Judicial murder can also be used to intimidate judges and prosecutors from carrying out their duties.

Judicial murder can take many different forms. Some examples include: shooting or bombarding a judge or prosecutor as they leave work or court; poisoning or smothering a judge or prosecutor in their sleep; rigging trials against the victim; or kidnapping and torturing the victim in order to extract information about their investigation into political corruption.

Judicial murder is a serious threat to the integrity of the justice system and the rule of law. It undermines the public's confidence in the judiciary and can lead to a spiral of corruption and violence. Governments must take measures to protect judges and prosecutors from attack, and they must ensure that investigations into judicial murder are carried out vigorously and impartially.","(229, 11)","Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated
killing of a person by a court of law, usually as a punishment for a crime.
It is a form of capital punishment that has been used throughout history in various cultures and legal systems.
The term ""judicial murder"" is often used to describe cases where an innocent person is convicted of a crime they did not commit and subsequently executed.
This can occur due to a variety of factors, including false confessions, faulty eyewitness testimony, and prosecutorial misconduct.
One of the most famous examples of judicial murder is the case of Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian immigrants who were convicted of murder in Massachusetts in 1920.

Another example is the case of the Scottsboro Boys, nine African American teenagers who were falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama in 1931.
They were convicted and sentenced to death, but their sentences were later commuted to life in prison.
In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of wrongful convictions and executions in the United States, leading to calls for reform of the criminal justice system.
One such case is that of Cameron Todd Willingham, who was executed in Texas in 2004 for allegedly setting a fire that killed his three daughters.

The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as
","The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as the caper family, are a family of plants in the order Brassicales. As currently circumscribed, the family contains 33 genera and about 700 species. The largest genera are Capparis (about 150 species), Maerua (about 100 species), Boscia (37 species) and Cadaba (30 species). Taxonomy 
The Capparaceae have long been considered closely related to and have often been included in the Brassicaceae, the mustard family (APG, 1998), in part because both groups produce glucosinolate (mustard oil) compounds. Subsequent molecular studies support Capparaceae sensu stricto as paraphyletic with respect to the Brassicaceae. However Cleome and several related genera are more closely related to members of the Brassicaceae than to the other Capparaceae. These genera are now either placed in the Brassicaceae (as subfamily Clemoideae) or segregated into the Cleomaceae. Several more genera of the traditional Capparaceae are more closely related to other members of the Brassicales, and the relationships of several more remain unresolved. Based on morphological grounds and supported by molecular studies, the American species traditionally identified as Capparis have been transferred to resurrected generic names. Several new genera have also been recently described.","(226, 10)","The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as capers, is a family of flowering plants in the order Capitatae. The family is subdivided into two subfamilies, Capparinae and Capreolinae. There are about 165 genera and 2,000 species of capers, distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical climates.

The capers are a terrestrial or semiterrestrial family of flowering plants. They are herbs or small shrubs, with fleshy leaves that are either alternate or opposite and entire or toothed. The flowers are arranged in spikelike inflorescences, each with a few small sepals and petals. The fruit is a tiny Capsicum, typically a pepper but sometimes a fruit that resembles a tomato. The genus Capparis contains the typical capers (Capparis spinosa) and the related genus Ceratonia contains the false capers (Ceratonia siliqua), which have edible fruits resembling those of the true capers.

The capers are native to Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Asia Minor, and North America. They have been naturalized in many other parts of the world. They grow best in slightly alkaline soil with good drainage and moderate fertility.","(206, 11)","The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as
the caper family, is a family of flowering plants in the order
Brassicales. The family consists of about 90 genera and 1,000
species of herbs, shrubs, and trees distributed throughout the
tropics and warm temperate regions of the world. The family is
named after the genus Capparis, which includes many of the
most well-known members of the family, such as the caper bush
(Capparis spinosa) and the caper spurge (Euphorbia cyparissias).
Members of the Capparaceae are characterized by their
distinctive flowers, which have four sepals, four petals, six
stamens, and a superior ovary. The flowers are usually
hermaphroditic, but some species are dioecious. The fruit is a
capsule that splits open to release the seeds. The leaves are
usually simple and alternate, but some species have compound
leaves. The family is economically important for its edible
fruits and vegetables, such as capers, caper berries, and
caper spurge. The family is also used in traditional medicine
and as a source of dyes and other products.","(201, 9)","The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as

Being an unsuccessful miner, he turned to bushranging. He robbed travellers on the Gulgong–Mudgee for several weeks. On 3 February 1865, Poo killed Senior Constable John Ward, who was looking for him. After the murder of Ward, the New South Wales Police organised a large-scale manhunt, which lasted two weeks and resulted in Poo being arrested and seriously injured during his arrest.  Poo was tried two times after his arrest. The first time on 10 April, he was tried for shooting with intent to kill at Aboriginal tracker Henry Hughes during his arrest and he was found guilty by the jury. The second time on 10 October, he was tried for the wilful murder of John Ward and he was again found guilty by the jury. He was sentenced to death and he was executed by hanging on 19 December 1865. Poo was fictionalised in David Martin's novel The Hero of Too (1965) and since has been a theme of a circus show, a children's novel and a planned feature film.","(230, 11)","Sam Poo (died 19 December 1865) was an English cricketer.

In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective
","In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that sees social behavior as an interactive product of the individual and the situation. In other words, it derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from social interaction, whereby subjectively held meanings are integral to explaining or understanding social behavior. This perspective studies the ways in which individuals shape, and are shaped by, society through their interactions. Interactionism thus argues that the individual is an active and conscious piece of the social-context system, rather than merely a passive object in their environment. It believes interactions to be guided by meanings that are attached to the self, to others with whom each individual interacts, and to situations of interaction; all of which are altered in interaction themselves. In this sense, interactionism may stand in contrast to studies of socialization, insofar as interactionism conceives individuals to influence groups at least as much as groups influence individuals.","(174, 6)","In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in human behaviour. It is a philosophical and methodological approach that began to develop in the 1940s and 1950s and has been influential in sociology, anthropology, and psychology.

Interactionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in human behaviour. It is a philosophical and methodological approach that began to develop in the 1940s and 1950s and has been influential in sociology, anthropology, and psychology. The basic idea is that humans are not just individual actors but are also members of social groups, which shapes their behaviour. Social interaction is thus seen as a key factor in understanding human behaviour.

Interactionism has a number of important implications for sociology. First, it emphasises the role of social norms and values in shaping behaviour.Second, it emphasises the importance of contextuality in understanding human behaviour. Finally, it stresses the importance of social interaction as a means of learning and understanding behaviour.

Interactionism has also had an important impact on the methodology of sociology. It has led to the development of social process theory and action research, two important methodological approaches within sociology.","(217, 11)","In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective
that emphasizes the importance of social interaction in shaping
individual behavior and society as a whole. It focuses on the
meaning that individuals attach to their social interactions and
the ways in which these meanings shape their actions and
perceptions. Interactionists argue that social reality is
constructed through the ongoing process of social interaction,
and that individuals actively participate in this process by
interpreting and responding to the actions of others.
Interactionism has its roots in the work of George Herbert
Mead, who developed the concept of the ""self"" as a product of
social interaction. Mead argued that individuals develop a sense
of self through their interactions with others, and that this
sense of self is shaped by the expectations and norms of the
society in which they live. Mead's work laid the foundation for
later interactionist theories, such as symbolic interactionism
and ethnomethodology.
Symbolic interactionism, developed by Herbert Blumer, focuses
on the ways in which individuals use symbols, such as language
and gestures, to communicate and make sense of their social
world. Blumer argued that individuals actively interpret and
respond to the symbols used by others, and that these
interpretations shape their actions and perceptions.
Ethnomethodology, developed by Harold Garfinkel, takes a more
sociological approach to interactionism, focusing on the ways in
which individuals use social rules and norms to make sense of
their social world. Garfinkel argued that individuals actively
participate in the construction of social reality through their
use of social rules and norms, and that these rules and norms
are constantly negotiated and renegotiated through social
interaction.
Interactionism has had a significant impact on the field of
sociology, particularly in the areas of social psychology and
micro-sociology. It has also influenced other fields, such as
anthropology and communication studies. Interactionism has been
used to explain a wide range of social phenomena, including
gender roles, race relations, and deviant behavior. It has also
been used to critique traditional sociological approaches that
focus on large-scale social structures and institutions, arguing
that these approaches fail to capture the complexity and
fluidity of social interaction.

","Moovalur Ramamirtham  (1883–1962) was a Tamil social reformer, author, and political activist of the Dravidian Movement, who worked for the abolition of the Devadasi system in the Madras Presidency. Born in Thiruvarur, she was brought up at Moovalur, a village near Mayiladhuthurai. She was the author of the 1936 novel Dasigalin Mosavalai alladhu madhi pettra minor (lit. Devadasis' web of deceit or the minor grown wise) which exposed the plight of the Devadasis. Originally a supporter of the nationalist Indian National Congress, she became a member of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement after Periyar left the Congress in 1925. In 1930, she supported Muthulakshmi Reddi's failed attempt to abolish the Devadasi system in the Presidency through legislation. She took part in the Anti-Hindi agitations of 1937-40 and in November 1938, was jailed for six weeks for participating in the agitations. The public awareness created by her novel and her continuous campaign to abolish the Devadasi system, were instrumental in the passage of the Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act or the Devadasi Abolition Bill, which outlawed the practice in 1947. In 1949, she parted ways with Periyar. She became a supporter of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a new party started by Periyar's protégé C. N. Annadurai. She remained a DMK supporter till her death in 1962.

In 1916, he was appointed professor of Tamil at the University of Madras where he remained until his retirement in 1956. He was also a visiting professor at universities in Australia, Canada, Europe and North America during this time.

Waterford city is situated in south eastern
","Waterford city is situated in south eastern Ireland, on the river Suir [pronounced Shure] about  from where the river enters the sea. Practically the entire city is built on the south bank of the river. The ""Old town"", now the business centre, clusters behind the broad quay-front on a low-lying strip of land left behind by a gentle loop of the river at this point. From this, the land rises sharply to the east and opposite to the west while remaining level in between. The eastern slopes are almost entirely occupied by private residential estates, while the western and southwestern prominences are largely given over to local council housing development. There are corresponding elevations on the north bank eastwards towards Christendom and westwards towards Mount Misery nothing. The rocks which form the base of the city all belong to the Palaeozoic Group – principally Ordovician shales underlying sandstone. On the East side of the city, the rock is crossed by an alluvial bank running N.E./S.W. At the cliffs alongside the banks of the River Suir, above Rice Bridge, inter-stratification of sharply-folded Ordovician Slates and Sandstone conglomerates may be clearly observed.","(211, 9)","Waterford city is situated in south eastern Ireland on the River Suir.

Burning Bush is a 2013 three-part miniseries
","Burning Bush  is a 2013 three-part miniseries created for HBO by Polish director Agnieszka Holland. Based on real characters and events, this haunting drama focuses on the personal sacrifice of a Prague history student, Jan Palach, who set himself on fire in 1969 in protest against the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia in the previous year. Dagmar Burešová, a young female lawyer, became part of his legacy by defending Palach's family in a trial against the communist government, a regime which tried to dishonour Palach’s sacrifice, a heroic action for the freedom of Czechoslovakia. The fight for freedom, for moral principles, self-sacrifice and protest in those desperate times led to the moral unification of a repressed nation, which twenty years later defeated the totalitarian regime. The anniversary of Jan Palach’s death inspired a new generation of students to start protests that led to the eventual fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, part of the eventual destruction of the Iron Curtain.","(179, 5)","Burning Bush  is a 2013 three-part Australian miniseries directed by Belinda McClaren. It is a historical drama set in the early years of the Australian settler colonies, and tells the story of a convict woman, Rose, who is transported to the new world in search of a new life.

Burning Bush was screened on Foxtel's History channel in Australia on 5, 9 and 12 October 2013. The miniseries was produced by Australian production company Madman Entertainment in association with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It was filmed on location in Victoria and New South Wales.

Burning Bush has been met with mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the miniseries has an approval rating of 50%, based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. 

The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave the series 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: ""This three-part saga about Rose (the talented newcomer played by Essie Davis) is absorbing enough that you'll forgive McClaren for not finding a more interesting or challenging subject."" 

IGN's Dan Stiles awarded the miniseries 8 out of 10 and called it ""a beautifully shot and well-acted period drama"". However, he added that ""its slow pacing will frustrate some viewers"", while Empire magazine's Tom Huddleston awarded the series 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: ""McClaren's languid direction occasionally lets Burning Bush descend into soap opera territory, but Davis'","(265, 10)","Burning Bush is a 2013 three-part miniseries

Not only did she do ethnographic field work, but she also trained with a retired lucha libre wrestler and his students.

This thus led her to write her book The World of Lucha Libra in which these ideas are explored.

Global aphasia is a severe form of
","Global aphasia is a severe form of nonfluent aphasia, caused by damage to the left side of the brain, that affects receptive and expressive language skills (needed for both written and oral language) as well as auditory and visual comprehension. Acquired impairments of communicative abilities are present across all language modalities, impacting language production, comprehension, and repetition. Patients with global aphasia may be able to verbalize a few short utterances and use non-word neologisms, but their overall production ability is limited. Their ability to repeat words, utterances, or phrases is also affected. Due to the preservation of the right hemisphere, an individual with global aphasia may still be able to express themselves through facial expressions, gestures, and intonation. This type of aphasia often results from a large lesion of the left perisylvian cortex. The lesion is caused by an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and is associated with damage to Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and insular regions which are associated with aspects of language. Signs and symptoms
It is most common for the onset of global aphasia to occur after a thrombotic stroke (at the trunk of the middle cerebral artery), with varying severity. The general signs and symptoms include the inability to understand, create, and repeat speech and language.  These difficulties also persist in reading, writing, and auditory comprehension abilities.
Verbal language typically consists of a few recognizable utterances and words (e.g., hello), overlearned phrases (e.g., how are you), and expletives (e.g., a curse word). However, those affected by global aphasia may express themselves using facial expressions, intonation, and gestures.  Extensive lexical (vocabulary) impairment is possible, resulting in an inability to read simple words or sentences. Global aphasia may be accompanied by weakness of the right side of the face and right hemiplegia (paralysis), but can occur with or without hemiparesis (weakness). Additionally, it is common for an individual with global aphasia to have one or more of the following additional impairments: apraxia of speech, alexia, pure word deafness, agraphia, facial apraxia, and depression.","(405, 15)","Global aphasia is a severe form of aphasia that affects all languages, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in producing spoken words and understanding spoken language. It is a disorder of the left hemisphere of the brain, and is more common in older people. It can be caused by a stroke, brain tumour, or head injury.

There is no known cure for global aphasia, but there are treatments available that can help improve language skills. Treatment typically includes speech therapy to help improve pronunciation and fluency, as well as rehabilitation programmes that focus on teaching essential daily living skills such as cooking and bathing. Some people may also require assistance with everyday activities such as reading and writing.

","Alexey Grigoryevich Rodin (Russian: Алексей Григорьевич Родин; 17 February 1902 – 27 May 1955) was a Soviet Army colonel general and Hero of the Soviet Union.  Born to a peasant family, Rodin was drafted into the Red Army in 1920. After fighting in the Russian Civil War, he became an officer and rose to command 50th Rifle Corps Armored and Mechanized forces during the Winter War. After the end of the war, Rodin became deputy commander of the 24th Tank Division and fought in the Baltic Operation and Leningrad Strategic Defensive. Given command of the 124th Tank Brigade in September 1941, he led the unit during battles around Leningrad and in the Lyuban Offensive Operation. From June 1942, Rodin commanded the 26th Tank Corps and led the unit during Operation Uranus. For its actions, the corps became the 1st Guards Tank Corps and Rodin received the title Hero of the Soviet Union. After Stalingrad, he was promoted to command the 2nd Tank Army and led it during Operation Kutuzov and the Battle of the Dnieper, but was dismissed due to lack of progress and heavy losses incurred in the army's advance. In September 1943, Rodin became commander of the Western Front (later 3rd Belorussian Front) Armored and Mechanized Forces, participating in Operation Suvorov, Operation Bagration and the East Prussian Offensive. Postwar, he became head of the Directorate of Combat Training of the Armored and Mechanized Forces before retirement in 1954.","(269, 10)","Alexey Grigoryevich Rodin (Russian: Алексей Григорьевич Родин; 26 July 1840 – 20 November 1917) was a Russian sculptor.

He returned to Russia in 1870 and soon gained acclaim for his work, which focused on monumental sculpture with a realistic approach. His first public commission was for a monument to Emperor Alexander II in Saint Petersburg.

Rodin's work was frequently criticized for its idealism and heavy handedness, but he remained one of the most popular and influential artists of his time. He had a significant impact on both French art and architecture, as well as on sculpture in general. Many of his works are found in public places around the world, such as The Gates of Hell on the Ismaili Imam Ali Mosque in Mumbai, India, The Thinker (1879) in Central Park in New York City, and The Kiss (1896) at The Louvre in Paris.

He was laid off from Chrysler in 1941, and later obtained a job at the Ford Lincoln Plant on Detroit’s west side. Immediately, Edwards became active in his new union, Local 900, at that time freely-recognized by the Ford Motor Company.  He served on the local’s education, citizenship, and by-laws committee and in 1944 was chosen to be chairman of that committee.

Two years later, after the death of Trankin, Hitov succeeded him as voivode of the band, which became one of the most active in southeastern Bulgaria. Some of his subordinates included Hadzhi Dimitar, Stoyan Papazov and Dyado Zhelyu. Around 1864–1865, Hitov began to regard his actions as part of the national liberation movement, and was in correspondence with Georgi Rakovski. In 1864, while in Serbia, he gathered band members among the Bulgarians in Kragujevac and Belgrade and moved to the region of Berkovitsa and Pirot.

","Matvei Fyodorovich Shkiryatov (Russian: Матвей Фёдорович Шкирятов; 15 August 1883 — 18 January 1954) was a Communist Party official and functionary who rose to power in the Soviet Union during the rule of Joseph Stalin. His entire career was spent imposing party discipline through the Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Though far less well known than successive chiefs of the Soviet police, such as Nikolai Yezhov or Lavrentiy Beria, he was arguably as steeply involved as either of them in the repression during the Stalin years. Unlike them, escaped arrest or public notoriety. Early career
Matvei Shkiryatov was the son of a peasant, born in a village called Vishnyakovo, in Tula Province. He joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906, and worked in the illegal party organisation in Moscow, Rostov-on-Don and Tula. He was arrested repeatedly, but avoided being deported to Siberia or held in prison for very long. There is no evidence that these arrests were for political activity. He was drafted into the imperial army in 1915. After the February Revolution, he was elected to the executive of the Moscow and Tula soviets. In 1918-20, he was secretary of the Moscow branch of the Garment Workers' Union.","(237, 11)","Matvei Fyodorovich Shkiryatov (Russian: Матвей Фёдорович Шкирятов; 18 October [O.S. 5 October] 1837 – 8 February [O.S. 15 February] 1881) was a Russian composer and pianist who is best remembered for his chamber music.

Matvei Shkiryatov was born in the town of Kremenchug, in what is now the Rostov Oblast of Russia, to a family of musicians. He showed early promise as a pianist, and studied with Nikolai Rubinstein in Moscow. In 1859, he won first prize at the Moscow Conservatory's competition for young composers.

Shkiryatov's earliest compositions were chamber pieces, but he soon began writing larger-scale works for orchestra. His first symphony, ""The Tempest"", was premiered in 1868 under the direction of Tchaikovsky. Shkiryatov's other symphonies include ""The Isle of the Dead"" (1871), ""The Maid of Orleans"" (1876), and ""The Invisible City"" (1881). Among his other orchestral works are the overtures ""The Stone Guest"" (1869), ""The Little Humpbacked Horse"" (1871), and ""Boris Godunov"" (1875).

Shkiryatov was born in 1903 in the Russian Empire. He joined the Bolshevik Party in 1918 and participated in the Russian Civil War. After the war, he held various positions in the Soviet government, including as a member of the Central Control Commission of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) from 1934 to 1939.
In 1939, Shkiryat ov was appointed as the head of the Main Political Directorate of the Red Army. During World War II, he served as a political commissar in the Soviet armed forces and was awarded the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner.

In 1952, Shk iryatov succeeded Georgy Malenkov as First Secretary of the CPSU. However, his tenure was short-lived, as he was removed from office in 1953 following the death of Joseph Stalin. He was replaced by Nikita Khrushchev, who would go on to become the leader of the Soviet Union.

Screeb House, built , was built as a hunting and fishing lodge and later extended. It was built by Thomas Fuge and was a former residence for the Berridge family, the local landlords in the 19th century.

The Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist dates from the 12th century, although alterations and additions were made in the 14th and 15th centuries. The roof was replaced in 1822 and further restoration work was carried out in 1892–94. The church contains a number of monuments, including one to Sir Thomas Lowther (died 1685), who served as Governor of Barbados and Jamaica, and another to Revd Richard Lowther (died 1740), who served as rector of Screeb from 1692 until his death.

This species makes up the bulk of the diet of the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) population breeding at the Small Prespa Lake. Alburnus belvica is a short-lived species which is found in freshwater lakes and slow-flowing water courses on low-lying plains. The adults' diet consists of invertebrates and plantas well as plankton. They form large schools when foraging.  and they spawn in the tributaries and along shores of lakes on pebbles and gravel in surf zone. If they are spawning in tributaries they move up to the spawning sites during the night. Spawning occurs in May and June and the adults are pelagic except when spawning.","(166, 11)","Alburnus belvica. the Prespa bleak, is a small, freshwater lake located in the southeastern part of the Republic of Macedonia.

The Prespa bleak, also known as Alburnus belvica, is a small freshwater lake located in the southeastern part of the Republic of Macedonia. The lake is the deepest of its kind in Europe and is home to a number of endemic animal and plant species. The Prespa bleak is an important Ramsar site, and has been designated a Wetland of International Importance.

The Prespa bleak lies in the southeastern part of Macedonia, close to the border with Kosovo. The lake occupies an area of 2.5 km² and has a maximum depth of 47 m. The surrounding terrain is hilly, with a few deep gorges. The climate is temperate and humid, with an average temperature of 10 °C and an annual rainfall of 400 mm.

The Prespa bleak was first explored by a team from the University of Zagreb in 1892. Its biological riches were first recognised in the 1920s, when it was discovered that the lake was home to a number of endemic animal and plant species. Since then, the Prespa bleak has been designated a Wetland of International Importance, and it has been used for research into water resources management.","(256, 12)","Alburnus belvica. the Prespa bleak, is a
species of ray-finned fish in the family Cyprinidae. It is
endemic to Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa in the Balkans. It is
threatened by overfishing and habitat loss.
The Prespa bleak is a small fish, growing to a
maximum length of about 10 cm (3.9 in). It has a slender body
and a pointed snout. The dorsal fin is located far back on the
body, and the caudal fin is forked. The scales are small and
smooth. The overall coloration is silvery, with a greenish
tint on the back and sides. The belly is white. The fins are
transparent, with the exception of the pectoral fins, which are
yellowish.
The diet of the Prespa bleak consists mainly of
zooplankton, such as copepods and cladocerans. It also feeds on
small insects and other invertebrates. The fish is an active
swimmer, using its fins to propel itself through the water. It
is a shoaling species, often seen in groups of up to several
hundred individuals. The Prespa bleak breeds in the spring and
summer, laying eggs on submerged vegetation or rocks. The eggs
are adhesive and stick to the substrate. The larvae hatch after
a few days and begin to feed on zooplankton. The fish reaches
sexual maturity at about two years of age.
The Prespa bleak is found only in Lake Ohrid and
Lake Prespa, two large lakes in the Balkans that are separated
by a narrow strip of land. The fish is endemic to these lakes,
meaning that it is found nowhere else in the world. The lakes
are oligotrophic, meaning that they are low in nutrients and
high in oxygen. This makes them ideal habitats for the Prespa
bleak, which requires clear, well-oxygenated water to survive.
The fish is threatened by a number of factors,
including overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Overfishing
is a major problem, as the fish is a popular food item in the
region. Habitat loss is also a concern, as the lakes are
shrinking due to climate change and human activities such as
irrigation and dam construction. Pollution is another threat,
as the lakes are vulnerable to runoff from agricultural and
industrial activities.

hundred individuals. The Prespa bleak breeds in the spring and
summer, laying eggs on submerged vegetation or rocks. The eggs
are adhesive and stick to the substrate. The larvae hatch after
a few days and begin to feed on zooplankton. The fish reaches
sexual maturity at about two years of age.
The Prespa bleak is found only in Lake Ohrid and
Lake Prespa, two large lakes in the Balkans that are separated
by a narrow strip of land. The fish is endemic to these lakes,
meaning that it is found nowhere else in the world. The lakes
are oligotrophic, meaning that they are low in nutrients and
high in oxygen. This makes them ideal habitats for the Prespa
bleak, which requires clear, well-oxygenated water to survive.
The fish is threatened by a number of factors,
including overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution. Overfishing
is a major problem, as the fish is a popular food item in the
region. Habitat loss is also a concern, as the lakes are
shrinking due to climate change and human activities such as
irrigation and dam construction. Pollution is another threat,
as the lakes are vulnerable to runoff from agricultural and
industrial activities.
Conservation efforts are underway to protect the

Rye is a seaside town in Greater
","Rye is a seaside town in Greater Melbourne on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, Australia. It is approximately 95 km south of Melbourne's central business district. Rye's beach, on the eastern side of Port Phillip, is popular with swimmers, fishermen, yachtsmen, and kitesurfers. Its ocean beach (which is not patrolled) is also popular with surfers and divers. Its local government area is the Shire of Mornington Peninsula. Rye is in the traditional country of the Boon wurrung (Bunurong) people of the Kulin nation. History
Rye was proclaimed a town on 26 February 1861 and is partly in the parish of Wannaeue but mainly in the parish of Nepean, which is west of Government Road and Weeroona Street. The township went south to the southern boundary of the cemetery, with its east and west boundaries being Weir Street and Dundas Street. Suburban lots of 21 to 98 acres extended west to French St and south to a point just past the Golf Pde corner. Most of these suburban lots were bought by W.A.Blair, a Melbourne Lime Merchant.
He also received grants for much land in the parishes of Wannaeue and Nepean. His objective was to establish a monopoly, which was only rivalled by John Cain. Many who had been engaged in the production of lime, such as Nathan Page, Tom Bennett, Edward Russell, Harold Bainbridge and Spunner, were dispossessed of their kilns by Blair in about 1867. Lime could be quarried throughout the area west of Boneo Road. Many golf courses and the Peninsula Hot Springs are on the sites of Limeburners' properties between Browns and Limestone Roads. An excellent reproduction of a lime kiln can be seen on the foreshore just east of White Cliff. They were built into the side of a hill so that firewood and napped limestone could be loaded from above.","(344, 17)","Rye is a seaside town in Greater Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

","Jaafar Muhammad an-Nimeiry (otherwise spelled in English as Jaafar Nimeiry, Jaafar Nimeiry or Ja'far Muhammad Numayri; ; 26 April 192830 May 2009) was a Sudanese politician who served as the president of Sudan from 1969 to 1985. A military officer, he came to power after a military coup in 1969. Establishing a one-party state, with his Sudanese Socialist Union as the sole legal political entity in the country, Nimeiry pursued socialist and Pan-Arabist policies and close collaboration with Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. In 1971 Nimeiry survived a pro-Soviet coup attempt, after which he forged an alliance with Mao Zedong of China (who provided him with significant military and economic assistance), and, eventually, with the United States as well. In 1972 he signed the Addis Ababa Agreement, ending the First Sudanese Civil War. In his last years in power he also adopted aspects of Islamism, and in 1983 he imposed Sharia law throughout the country, precipitating the Second Sudanese Civil War. He was ousted from power in 1985 and went into exile in Egypt. He returned in 1999 and ran in the presidential elections in 2000, but did poorly.","(219, 8)","Jaafar Muhammad an-Nimeiry (otherwise spelled in English Jaafar al-Nimeiry; Arabic: جعفر محمد النميري‎) (born 7 February 1928) is a former President of Sudan, serving from 6 March 1969 until his resignation on 2 October 1986.

Nimeiry was elected president in 1969, and retained office until his resignation on 2 October 1986. During his presidency, Nimeiry's government faced several difficulties, including a series of conflicts with southern Sudanese rebels, an oil embargo by the United Arab Emirates and a series of coup attempts. The latter culminated in the September 1985 coup d'état led by General Omar al-Bashir which overthrew Nimeiry's government.

","The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection was the first world-wide proclamation against the manufacturing and international trade in liquor and drugs as well as the prohibition of legalised vice. It served as a first major campaign to raise public awareness of the need for international agreements on controls for opium and its derivatives. Description of the petition
Addressed to all rulers and nations of the world, this petition to adopt prohibition was written by the American Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) president Frances Willard in 1884. It was carried across the world by at least four World WCTU missionaries who gathered signatures of nearly eight million people in more than fifty countries. The signatures can be categorized in three basic sections: signatures of individual women, written endorsements of men, and attestations of leaders of groups that had endorsed the petition. The signed petitions from the U.S. (over 750,000) were sent to Mrs. Rebecca C. Shuman in Evanston, Illinois who trimmed and mounted them on white muslin, one-half yard in width and bound with red ribbon on one side and blue ribbon on the other. Signed petitions from Great Britain (350,000 signatories) came in already mounted on cloth in time for presentation to the U.S. president in February 1885. The Polyglot Petition is archived in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union Administration Building in Evanston, Illinois, United States of America.","(252, 8)","The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection was a petition started in late 2017 by a coalition of individuals concerned about the rise of nationalism and xenophobia around the world.

The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection was started in late 2017 by a coalition of individuals concerned about the rise of nationalism and xenophobia around the world. The petition called for the protection of multilingualism and the promotion of linguistic diversity. The goal of the petition was to raise awareness about the importance of preserving and promoting multilingualism, and to call on governments to take action to protect languages and cultures from discrimination and violence.

The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection received a significant amount of support from around the world. The petition was signed by over 100,000 people from over 100 countries, including prominent figures such as Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison and actor George Clooney. The petition also received support from organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, which called on governments to take action to protect languages and cultures from discrimination and violence.

In response to the widespread support the Polyglot Petition for Home Protection has received, several governments have announced plans to take action to protect languages and cultures from discrimination and violence. For example, the French government announced plans to create a new Ministry dedicated to protecting multilingualism and linguistic diversity, while the Italian government announced plans to create a new ministry specifically devoted to protecting minority language rights.","(275, 10)","The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection was

Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained
","Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained in the lands around the Black Sea, especially in Crimea. They were the least-impactful on the fate of Europe and the longest-lasting of the Gothic communities. Their existence is well attested through the ages though the exact period when they ceased to exist as a distinct culture is unknown; as with the Goths in general, they may have been diffused with the surrounding peoples. In the Fourth Turkish letter by Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, they are described as ""a warlike people, who to this day inhabit many villages"" though in the 5th century, Theodoric the Great failed to rouse Crimean Goths to support his war in Italy. At the time, it was customary to refer to a wide range of Germanic tribes as ""Goths"", so the exact ethnic origin of the Germanic peoples in Crimea is a subject of debate. Aside from textual reports of the existence of the Goths in Crimea, both first and second hand, from as early as 850, numerous archaeological examples also exist, including the ruins of the former capital city of the Crimean Goths: Doros, or Mangup as it is now known. On top of this, there are numerous articles of jewelry, weaponry, shields, buttons, pins, and small personal artifacts on display in museums in Crimea and in the British Museum which have led to a better understanding of the Gothic Kingdom.","(265, 7)","Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained in Crimea after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. They are thought to have assimilated with the locals, and their descendants are today known as Crimean Tatars.

They were closely related to the Goths, who lived in present-day Germany and Denmark. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, the Greuthungi-Gothic tribes remained in Crimea, which was part of the Eastern Roman Empire.

The Crimean Goths were closely related to the Ostrogoths, who lived in present-day Italy and Spain. The Crimean Goths were also closely related to the Visigoths, who lived in present-day France and Portugal.

The viola da Terceira (also viola Terceirense)
","The  viola da Terceira (also viola Terceirense) is a stringed musical instrument of the guitar family, from the Portuguese islands of the archipelago of the Azores, associated with the island of Terceira. History
The viola and other string instruments were brought during the Portuguese maritime expansion to the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde, Brazil and other locales, becoming common in the populations. Due to its importance in Portuguese music it likely arrived in Angola, Goa and Macau, and as far as Hawaii by the 19th century, where it became the forerunner of the ukulele. These early cordophones, the violas, had characteristics identical to the modern instruments, and great importance along the Iberian Peninsula, where it appeared in iconography, poems and diverse literature. The chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso, who identified it as just a ""Viola"", suggested that it first arrived in the Azores in the second half of the 19th century, brought the first settlers. There is little documentation that dates the arrival of the Portuguese Violas de Arame in the islands of the Azores.","(199, 6)","The  viola da Terceira (also viola da gamba, viola da quarta or viola da quinta) is a bowed string instrument belonging to the violin family. It was formerly known as the viola da gamba de quarta corda, because the fourth string of the viola da gamba is tuned a fourth lower than the other strings. The name ""viola da Terceira"" was introduced in the 18th century. The viola da Terceira is commonly used in classical music, chamber music and as a solo instrument.

The viola da Terceira is generally tuned in fifths, GDAE (Guitar tuning). Unlike the violin, which has four strings in three courses (E, A, D), the viola da Terceira has five strings in four courses. The lowest string is G, the next D, then A, followed by E and finally G. This configuration gives it a brighter sound than the violin and enables it to be played more easily in higher positions on the keyboard.

The viola da Terceira was first constructed around 1550 by Antonio Stradivari and his sons Giuseppe and Antonio. It became one of Stradivari's most popular and renowned instruments, and many of his violas are still extant. The viola da Terceira was often used by composer Antonio Vivaldi and performers like Antonio Caldara and Giovanni Battista Viotti.","(245, 10)","The viola da Terceira (also viola Terceirense)

Cleanliness is both the abstract state of
","Cleanliness is both the abstract state of being clean and free from germs, dirt, trash, or waste, and the habit of achieving and maintaining that state. Cleanliness is often achieved through cleaning. Culturally, cleanliness is usually a good quality, as indicated by the aphorism: ""Cleanliness is next to Godliness"", and may be regarded as contributing to other ideals such as health and beauty. In emphasizing an ongoing procedure or set of habits for the purpose of maintenance and prevention, the concept of cleanliness differs from purity, which is a physical, moral, or ritual state of freedom from pollutants. Whereas purity is usually a quality of an individual or substance, cleanliness has a social dimension and direction or implies a system of interactions. ""Cleanliness,"" observed Jacob Burckhardt, ""is indispensable to our modern notion of social perfection."" A household or workplace may be said to exhibit cleanliness, but not ordinarily purity; cleanliness also would be a characteristic of the people who maintain cleanness or prevent dirtying.","(194, 7)","Cleanliness is both the abstract state of being clean, and the quality of being clean.

Cleanliness is an important factor in maintaining good health. It is necessary for preventing the spread of disease, and for maintaining a pleasant environment. Cleanliness can also be important for personal hygiene and appearance.

There are many ways to achieve cleanliness. Physical cleanliness can involve removal of dirt, dust, and other debris from one's environment. Chemical cleanliness can involve the use of disinfectants or sanitizers to clean surfaces or objects. Biological cleanliness refers to the prevention of the spread of disease by ensuring that objects and surfaces are free of germs.

Cleanliness is an important virtue in many religions and ethical traditions. Some believe that it is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Cleanliness is also an important part of many Eastern philosophies, such as Buddhism and Taoism.","(161, 11)","Cleanliness is both the abstract state of

The opposite of cleanliness is dirt, grime, muck, filth or sludge.
Cleanliness is also important for health, and many diseases are spread
through contaminated food. Therefore, clean food is generally considered
healthier. Cleanliness is required in order to prevent many
contagious diseases, such as scabies, food poisoning, chickenpox, and the

compromised by conditions such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, and old age.
Maintaining cleanliness also means having a place for
everything, so that everything is in its place, and having everything in its
place means that everything is where it belongs, so that it can be put away
after using, or left out when it will be needed later.
Cleanliness plays an important role in medicine and
public health, where it has been shown in to reduce the spread of infection-causing
organisms within healthcare settings. For example, hand washing, particularly
before and after certain activities, is one of the best ways to avoid getting

Marcus Herennius Faustus was a Roman senator,
","Marcus Herennius Faustus was a Roman senator, who was active during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian. He was suffect consul in the nundinium of March of April 121 with Quintus Pomponius Marcellus as his colleague.  An inscription on the Colossi of Memnon at Luxor in Egypt refers to a Marcus Herennius M.f. Quir. Faustus Tiberius Julius Clemens Tadius Flaccus, who is likely the same person. Some authorities point to a line at the end of this inscription which has been read as Geta cos and assumed to refer to either Publius Septimius Geta, consul II in 203, or Geta, son of emperor Septimus Severus and consul in 205. If this identification is correct, this inscription would attest to an otherwise unknown consul who lived in the late second century/early third. On the other hand, Werner Eck has offered arguments against a later date, pointing out that the letters in question have also been read as IRISE [...] CETACO, as well as arguing that it would make better sense for this inscription to be carved during the emperor Hadrian's visit in 128.","(202, 8)","Marcus Herennius Faustus was a Roman senator, statesman and philosopher of the first century AD. He was a friend of Cicero and a critical commentator on the works of Plato. Faustus is chiefly known for his philosophical treatise De Divinatione, in which he defends the practice of divination from the charges of superstition.

Marcus Herennius Faustus was born around 100 BC in the town of Arpinum in Latium, one of Rome's most prestigious neighbourhoods. He came from a distinguished family, his father being a consul and his grandfather an equestrian magistrate. Faustus himself entered public life at an early age, serving as a quaestor in Macedonia and as a praetor in Cilicia. In 89 BC he was elected to the Roman Senate, where he performed distinguished service as an orator and advisor to successive Roman governors.

Faustus's greatest achievement came in the years leading up to 50 BC, when he served as praetor and governor of Cilicia. It was during this time that he became close friends with Cicero, with whom he shared a love of philosophy. Faustus is best known today for his philosophical treatise De Divinatione (On Divination), which he wrote in 54 BC in response to charges of superstition levelled against diviners by the Roman senator Gaius Valerius Flaccus.

The National League is the fifth highest level of the overall pyramid, while the National League North and National League South exist at the sixth level. The top team and the winner of the play-off of the Premier division will be promoted to League Two, while the bottom four are relegated to the North or South divisions.

The National League was the second major professional sports league in the United States and one of four in North America. It was founded in 1876 as the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, and became the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs in 1892. The NL operated as a business league under the auspices of the National League President, and had two divisions: the American League and the National League.

The NL had two playoff formats during its history: a best-of-three series between division winners or a one-game wild card playoff between the third-place finisher in each division and the winner of a best-of-five series between the two divisional champions. The NL also had a three-division format from 1969 to 1993. Since 1994, all teams in both leagues have been in one division. In 2012, Major League Baseball (MLB) announced that it would expand to 30 teams for the 2012 season, with two teams added to each league. This resulted in each league having 14 teams and an eight-team playoff format.

Thanadelthur ""Thanadeltth'er"" (c. 1697 – 5 February
","Thanadelthur ""Thanadeltth'er"" (c. 1697 – 5 February 1717) was a woman of the Chipewyan Dënesųłı̨ne nation who served as a guide and interpreter for the Hudson's Bay Company. She was instrumental in forging a peace agreement between the Dënesųłı̨ne (Chipewyan) and the Cree people. She was trilingual, able to speak English, Chipewyan, and Cree. Life 
Thanadelthur is thought to have been born during 1697. In early 1713,  a party of Dënesųłı̨ne Chipewyans were attacked by Crees and their women were captured; among these was Thanadelthur. Women were sometimes the cause of tribal warfare, and were the prizes once the battle was over. Female slaves were valuable to the tribal workforce, and this added to the high female mortality rate among them as well. After spending the winter with their Cree captors, Thanadelthur and one other woman escaped and attempted to rejoin their people. Cold and hunger prevented them from doing so, however, and the two endured a year of hardship until Thanadelthur's travelling companion died. Five days later Thanadelthur was discovered by goose hunters from the Hudson's Bay Company. Her story was never self documented despite all of her dealings with the Hudson's Bay Company, and all of her legacy is contained to the journals from members of the HBC.","(242, 11)","Thanadelthur ""Thanadeltth'er"" (c. 1697 – 5 February 1768) was a German-born Swiss painter, draughtsman and etcher.

Thanadelthur was born in 1697 in the city of Mainz, Germany. He was the son of the painter Christian Thanadelthur. He moved to Switzerland in 1727, and settled in Interlaken. Thanadelthur died in Interlaken in 1768.

Thanadelthur is best known for his paintings of landscapes and historical scenes. His work is characterized by its precision and clarity of detail, and his use of light and color to create a sense of harmony and beauty. His paintings are often compared to the works of 17th-century Dutch painters such as Rembrandt and Johannes Vermeer.

Thanadelthur's work has been exhibited in museums around the world, including the Louvre, the National Gallery of Canada, and the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. He has also been awarded several prestigious awards, including the Grand Prix de Rome (1736) and the Royal Gold Medal from King Louis XV of France (1747).","(187, 10)","Thanadelthur ""Thanadeltth'er"" (c. 1697 – 5 February
1720) was a Chipewyan woman who served as an interpreter and diplomat for the Hudson's Bay Company during the early 18th century. She played a crucial role in establishing peace between the Chipewyan and Cree nations, which had been at war for several years. Thanadelthur's diplomatic efforts led to the signing of the Treaty of Albany in 1726, which ended the conflict and established a lasting peace between the two groups.
Thanadelthur was born into the Chipewyan nation in what is now northern Alberta, Canada. Little is known about her early life, but it is believed that she was raised in a traditional Chipewyan community and learned the language and customs of her people. As a young woman, Thanadelthur was taken captive by the Cree, who were at war with the Chipewyan. She was held captive for several years, during which time she learned the Cree language and developed a deep understanding of their culture.
In 1719, Thanadelthur escaped from her captors and made her way to Fort Churchill, a Hudson's Bay Company trading post in what is now Manitoba, Canada. There, she sought refuge and assistance from the company's governor, James Knight. Knight recognized Thanadelthur's potential as a diplomat and interpreter and hired her to work for the company.
Over the next few years, Thanadelthur traveled extensively throughout the Hudson Bay region, acting as an interpreter and mediator between the various First Nations groups. She played a key role in negotiating peace treaties between the Cree and Chipewyan nations, as well as other groups such as the Ojibwe and Assiniboine.
Thanadelthur's most significant achievement was her role in the Treaty of Albany, which was signed in 1726. The treaty established a permanent peace between the Cree and the Chipewyan, ending years of conflict and bloodshed. It also established a system of trade and cooperation between the two groups, which helped to strengthen their economies and improve their quality of life.
Thanadelthur died in 1720, just a few years after the Treaty of Albany was signed. Despite her short life, she left a lasting legacy as one of the most important diplomats and interpreters in Canadian history. Her contributions to the establishment of peace and cooperation between the First Nations groups of the Hudson Bay region continue to be recognized and celebrated to this day.","(440, 18)","Thanadelthur ""Thanadeltth'er"" (c. 1697 – 5 February

It was originally named Castle's Wood's, as the land in the immediate area had once belonged to Jacob Castle, a frontiersman in the likes of Daniel Boone. Castle purchased the land from the Shawnee Indians, for very little in trade.  It is reported that the purchase was made with the Shawnee Indians for a ""hound dog, a knife, and a shot of whiskey. As a ""Long Hunter"", he spent long periods of time in the wilderness on hunting expeditions.  There he befriended the Indians that inhabited the land in the Castlewood area.  He married a Shawnee woman by the name of Gliding Swan and they produced many children. It has been said that Castle himself showed Daniel Boone the Cumberland Gap and areas west, which led to Boone's expedition and settlement of said lands.  Many descendants of Castle reside in Russell County, Virginia and the surrounding area.  Castle's father, Peter Cassell was a German emigrant to Pennsylvania who was influential in the Dutch movement to America.

He was the leader of El Salvador during World War II. While he served as President Arturo Araujo's Vice President and defense minister, a directorate seized power during a palace coup and afterwards named General Hernández Martínez President of El Salvador. He was President of El Salvador for almost 12 years and ruled the nation with an authoritarian one party state lead by the fascistic and anti-communist National Pro Patria Party. His rule was marked by rigged and fraudulent elections and brutality, most notably the 1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre, known as La Matanza (""The Massacre""). Under his rule, El Salvador joined the Allied Powers during World War II on 8 December 1941 following the Bombing of Pearl Harbor.

The Kitayatsu site is located is located on a plateau at an elevation of 145 meters that spreads out at the foot of the southeastern foot of Mount Haruna. In the year 2000, the ruins of a large fortified residence belonging to a gōzoku clan ruling the surrounding area during the Kofun period was discovered. The site was fortified by two ravines forming natural moats to the east and west and two artificial moats with a width of 30 meters and depth of three meters to protect the northern and southern sides. The moats contained masonry with a breccia substrate, and it appears that the north and west moats also served for water storage. It is estimated through analysis of the volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount Asama which had accumulated in the moats to date from the latter half of the 5th century AD, or the middle of the Kofun period.

In traffic flow theory, the Newell–Daganzo merge
","In traffic flow theory, the Newell–Daganzo merge model describes a simple procedure on how to determine the flows exiting two branch roadways and merging to flow through a single roadway. The model is simple in that it does not consider the actual merging process between vehicles as the two branch roadways come together. The only information required to calculate the flows leaving the two branch roadways are the capacities of the two branch roadways and the exiting capacity, the demands into the system, and a value describing how the two input flows interact. This latter input term is called the split priority, or merge ratio, and is defined as the proportion of the two input flows when both are operating in congested conditions. The history of the merge model has its origins in Gordon Newell's description of the merging process, but Daganzo's cell transmission model lays out a diagram for a highway merge, and describes the application of the theory.","(174, 5)","In traffic flow theory, the Newell–Daganzo merge model is a model for the merging of two or more traffic streams into one. The model was developed by John D. Newell and Kenneth D. Daganzo in their 1972 paper ""A Model for the Merging of Traffic Streams.""

The Newell–Daganzo merge model is a mathematical model that is used to understand the behavior of traffic streams that are merging into one. The model accounts for the interactions between the traffic streams, and it can be used to predict the behavior of the combined traffic stream.

The Newell–Daganzo merge model is based on the concept of flow separation. In theory, flow separation occurs when two or more traffic streams are able to remain separate from each other. However, in practice, flow separation is rarely achieved and is instead replaced by flow merging.

Flow merging occurs when two or more traffic streams are forced to merge together. This process can be difficult and can lead to congestion on the roads. The Newell–Daganzo merge model is designed to help us understand how flow merging affects the behavior of the combined traffic stream.

The Newell–Daganzo merge model relies on two basic principles: conflict and cooperation. Conflict refers to the interactions between the different traffic streams, while cooperation refers to the way that the different traffic streams interact with each other.

The Newell–Daganzo merge model can be used to predict the behavior of the combined traffic stream. It can also be used","(267, 14)","In traffic flow theory, the Newell–Daganzo merge
model (NDMM) is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of vehicles merging into a single lane from two or more lanes. The model was developed by David W. Newell and Carlos Daganzo in the 1980s and has since become a widely used tool in traffic engineering and transportation planning.
The NDMM is based on the principle of conservation of vehicles, which states that the number of vehicles entering a merge point must equal the number of vehicles leaving the merge point. The model assumes that vehicles enter the merge point at a constant rate, and that the time it takes for a vehicle to pass through the merge point is a function of the number of vehicles already in the merge point.
The NDMM can be used to estimate the capacity of a merge point, which is the maximum number of vehicles that can pass through the point in a given time period. It can also be used to predict the delay experienced by vehicles as they merge into a single lane, and to optimize the design of merge points to minimize delays.
One of the key advantages of the NDMM is its simplicity and ease of use. It requires only a few inputs, such as the number of lanes entering the merge point, the number of lanes leaving the merge point, and the average speed of vehicles in each lane. The model can then be used to calculate the capacity and delay of the merge point, as well as the optimal design of the merge point to minimize delays.
The NDMM has been used in a wide range of applications, including the design of highway interchanges, the optimization of traffic signal timing, and the analysis of traffic flow in urban areas. It has also been used to study the impact of various factors on traffic flow, such as weather conditions, road geometry, and driver behavior.
Overall, the NDMM is a valuable tool for traffic engineers and transportation planners, providing a simple and effective way to analyze and optimize the performance of merge points in traffic networks.","(386, 12)","In traffic flow theory, the Newell–Daganzo merge

speed, which is not true in real life. However,
the model is still useful because it can be used
to predict how traffic will behave in certain
situations. For example, if you want to know
how traffic will behave when two lanes merge
into one lane, you can use the merge model to

model (NDMM) is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of vehicles merging into a single lane from two or more lanes. The model was developed by David W. Newell and Carlos Daganzo in the 1980s and has since become a widely used tool in traffic engineering and transportation planning.
The NDMM is based on the principle of conservation of vehicles, which states that the number of vehicles entering a merge point must equal the number of vehicles leaving the merge point. The model assumes that vehicles enter the merge point at a constant rate, and that the time it takes for a vehicle to pass through the merge point is a function of the number of vehicles already in the merge point.
The NDMM can be used to estimate the capacity of a merge point, which is the maximum number of vehicles that can pass through the point in a given time period. It can also be used to predict the delay experienced by vehicles as they merge into a single lane, and to optimize the design of merge points to minimize delays.
One of the key advantages of the NDMM is its simplicity and ease of use. It requires only a few inputs, such as the number of lanes entering the merge point, the number of lanes leaving the merge point, and the average speed of vehicles in each lane. The model can then be used to calculate the capacity and delay of the merge point, as well as the optimal design of the merge point to minimize delays.
The NDMM has been used in a wide range of applications, including the design of highway interchanges, the optimization of traffic signal timing, and the analysis of traffic flow in urban areas. It has also been used to study the impact of various factors on traffic flow, such as weather conditions, road geometry, and driver behavior.
Overall, the NDMM is a valuable tool for traffic engineers and transportation planners, providing a simple and effective way to analyze and optimize the performance of merge points in traffic networks.","In traffic flow theory, the Newell–Daganzo merge

the model is still useful because it can be used
to predict how traffic will behave in certain
situations. For example, if you want to know
how traffic will behave when two lanes merge

Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα) was an Attic
","Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα)  was an Attic festival, celebrated principally at Eleusis, in honour of Demeter (Δήμητρα, η Αλωαίη), protector of the fruits of the earth, of Dionysus, god of the grape and of wine, and Poseidon (Ποσειδώνας ο Φυτάλμιος), god of the seashore vegetation. In Greek, the word hálōs (ἅλως) from which Haloa derives means “threshing-floor” or “garden.” While the general consensus is that it was a festival related to threshing—the process of loosening the edible part of cereal grain after harvest—some scholars disagree and argue that it was instead a gardening festival. Haloa focuses mainly on the “first fruits” of the harvest, partly as a grateful acknowledgement for the benefits the husbandmen received, partly as prayer that the next harvest would be plentiful. The festival was also called Thalysia or Syncomesteria. The festival 
Haloa took place every year, during the month Poseideon (Ποσειδέωνας), after the first harvest was over. The festival took place around the threshing floor (αλώνια) at the same time throughout Attica. All women were expected to attend this event, but men were almost always excluded. Men had a legal and moral expectation to pay for their wives’ expenses in these festivities.
The strange timing of the harvest festival—mid-winter—is significant as well. The Greeks regarded the festival as sacred to not only Demeter but also to Dionysus. With the inclusion of Dionysus in the festival worship, the date shifted towards the winter as “he possessed himself of the festivals of Demeter, took over her threshing-floor and compelled the anomaly of a winter threshing festival.” In many ways, the festival was just as connected, if not more so, with Dionysus than with Demeter. Thus, we see the power and influence of the incoming god and of the importance of wine to Greek cult activity. Practically, Greeks were able to coax out a harvest just early enough to revel with Dionysus.","(368, 13)","Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα)  was an ancient city in the middle of the Nile Delta in present-day Al Fayyum governorate, Egypt. It was one of the most important cultural and commercial centers of Lower Egypt during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods. 

The name Haloa derives from the ancient Egyptian word ""h(a)r-w-aa"" meaning ""white"". The site is located on the eastern bank of the River Nile, opposite to modern Cairo, and was originally settled during the Predynastic Period. The city was abandoned following a series of floods in the New Kingdom period, but was briefly occupied by the Roman Empire in the late 1st century AD. It was later abandoned for good after a series of fires in late antiquity. The ruins of Haloa are today located approximately 2 km south of the present-day city of Al Fayyum.

Haloa was an important cultural and commercial center during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods. The city was home to a number of significant ancient sites, including a temple dedicated to Pharaoh Menkaure, a necropolis dating back to Dynasties III and IV, and a large granary. The city also played an important role in the development of writing in ancient Egypt, as it was home to one of the earliest known scriptoria.","(238, 10)","Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα) was an Attic
festival in honor of Demeter and her daughter Persephone. It was celebrated on the 6th day of the month of Pyanepsion, which corresponds to October/November in the Gregorian calendar. The festival commemorated the return of Persephone from the Underworld, where she had been held captive by Hades, and her reunion with her mother Demeter. Haloa was a joyous occasion, marked by feasting, dancing, and the exchange of gifts. It was also a time for farmers to celebrate the end of the harvest season and to give thanks for a bountiful crop.
The origins of Haloa are shrouded in mystery, but it is believed to have been an ancient festival that predated the arrival of the Greeks in Attica. The festival was associated with the Eleusinian Mysteries, a secret religious cult that was centered around the worship of Demeter and Persephone. Haloa was one of the few festivals that were open to both men and women, and it was a time for people to come together and celebrate the cycle of life and death.
During the festival, people would gather in the countryside and feast on a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, and grains. They would also offer sacrifices to the gods and goddesses of the harvest, including Demeter, Persephone, and Hades. In addition to the feasting and dancing, there were also games and competitions, such as wrestling and chariot races.
One of the most important aspects of Haloa was the exchange of gifts between friends and family members. People would give each other small tokens of appreciation, such as flowers, fruit, or coins. These gifts were meant to symbolize the renewal of life and the hope for a prosperous future.
Despite its ancient origins, Haloa continued to be celebrated in Attica well into the Roman period. In fact, the festival was so popular that it was even mentioned by the Roman poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses. However, over time, the festival began to decline in popularity, and by the 4th century CE, it had all but disappeared.
Today, Haloa is largely forgotten, but it remains an important part of the cultural heritage of Attica. It is a reminder of the ancient Greeks' deep connection to the land and their reverence for the natural world. It is also a testament to the enduring power of festivals and rituals to bring people together and celebrate the cycles of life and death.","(459, 20)","Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα) was an Attic

The 1981 VFA season was a roller coaster ride for most clubs. For many of them, it was their first season back in the Association since the disastrous 1978 season. There were a few clubs that had made a long-awaited return, such as Northcote, Coburg and Williamstown. However, there were also a number of new clubs that made their debut in 1981, such as Frankston, Preston and Oakleigh.

There were some major changes to the Association this season. The two biggest changes were the introduction of a finals series and the introduction of a promotion and relegation system. The finals series consisted of four rounds (two semi-finals and two grand finals), with the top two teams from each division qualifying for the finals. The promotion and relegation system meant that the bottom three teams in each division would be relegated to Division 2, while the top two teams in Division 2 would be promoted to Division 1.

It is located on the western side of the Naqsh-e Jahan Square, opposite to Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, and had been originally designed as a vast portal entrance to the grand palace which stretched from the Naqsh-e Jahan Square to the Chahar Baq Boulevard. The palace served as the official residence of Persian Emperors of the Safavid dynasty. UNESCO inscribed the Palace and the Square as a World Heritage Site due to its cultural and historical importance. The palace is forty-eight meters high and there are  six floors, each accessible by a difficult spiral staircase. In the sixth floor, Music Hall, deep circular niches are found in the walls, having not only aesthetic value, but also acoustic. Ālī Qāpū is regarded as the best example of Safavid architecture and a symbol of Iran's Islamic heritage. The name Ali Qapu, from Persian ‘Ālī (meaning ""imperial"" or ""great""), and Azerbaijani Qāpū (meaning ""gate""), was given to this place as it was right at the entrance to the Safavid palaces which stretched from the Naqsh-e Jahan Square to the Chahar Baq Boulevard.
The building, another wonderful Safavid edifice, was built by decree of Shah Abbas I in the early seventeenth century. It was here that the great monarch used to entertain noble visitors, and foreign ambassadors.

The palace was designed by French architect Jacques Necker and built from 1785 to 1795. The original design featured a series of large square blocks, but it was modified in subsequent years. The palace has been the official residence of the Iranian monarchs since 1836. In 1925, Mohammad Reza Shah moved his court from Tehran to the Ali Qapu Palace, in order to escape the Great Fire of 1925. The palace was damaged during the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and was closed to the public for many years afterwards. In 2002, it underwent extensive restoration and reopened to the public as a museum.

Scotland Yard (officially New Scotland Yard) is
","Scotland Yard (officially New Scotland Yard) is the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, the territorial police force responsible for policing the 32 boroughs of London. Its name derives from the location of the original Metropolitan Police headquarters at 4 Whitehall Place, which had a rear entrance on a street called Great Scotland Yard. The Scotland Yard entrance became the public entrance to the police station, and over time the street and the Metropolitan Police became synonymous. The New York Times wrote in 1964 that, just as Wall Street gave its name to New York's financial district, Scotland Yard became the name for police activity in London. The force moved from Great Scotland Yard in 1890, to a newly completed building on the Victoria Embankment, and the name ""New Scotland Yard"" was adopted for the new headquarters. An adjacent building was completed in 1906. A third building was added in 1940. In 1967, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) moved its headquarters from the three-building complex to a tall, newly constructed building on Broadway in Victoria. In summer 2013, it was announced that the force would move to the Curtis Green Building – which is the third building of New Scotland Yard's previous site (1890–1967) – and that the headquarters would be renamed Scotland Yard. In November 2016, MPS moved to its new headquarters, which continues to bear the name of ""New Scotland Yard"".","(266, 10)","Scotland Yard (officially New Scotland Yard) is a central police station in London, England.

The first Scotland Yard was established in 1855 on a site east of what is now Whitehall near the present-day Charing Cross railway station. The force had its first headquarters there in a converted house and occupied other buildings until 1885. In that year, it moved to its present site. 

The original Scotland Yard building was destroyed by a German bomb during the Second World War and was replaced by the present structure, which opened in 1963. The first female officer to join the Metropolitan Police was Constance Beaumont in 1978.

Missouri, a state near the geographical center
","Missouri, a state near the geographical center of the United States, has three distinct physiographic divisions:  a north-western upland plain or prairie region part of the Interior Plains' Central Lowland (areas Osage Plain 12f and Dissected Till Plains 12e) known as the northern plains
 a lowland in the extreme southeast bootheel region of Missouri, part of the Atlantic Plain known as the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (areas 3e) or the Mississippi embayment
 the Missouri portion of the Ozark Plateau (areas 14a and 14b) which lies between the Mississippi Alluvial Plain and the Central lowland.
The boundary between the northern plains and the Ozark region follows the 
Missouri River from its mouth at St. Louis to Columbia. This also corresponds to the southernmost extent of glaciation during the Pre-Illinoian Stage which destroyed the remnant plateau to the north but left the ancient landforms to the south unaltered. The Ozark boundary runs southwestward from there towards Joplin at the southeast corner of Kansas. The boundary between the Ozark and lowland regions runs southwest from Cape Girardeau on the Mississippi River to the Arkansas border just southwest of Poplar Bluff. Missouri borders eight other US States, more than any other state except Tennessee, which also borders eight states.","(223, 6)","Missouri, a state near the geographical center of the United States, is bounded on the north by the Minnesota border, on the east by the Ohio River, on the south by Arkansas, and on the west by the Mississippi River.

The state's highest point is Mount Whitney in the Sierra Nevada range at 14,505 feet (4,406 meters). Missouri has a generally humid subtropical climate. The average temperature in Missouri ranges from 34 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in the coldest winter months to 92 degrees Fahrenheit (36 degrees Celsius) in the hottest summer months.

Missouri was originally part of Louisiana, and was acquired by the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase. The first European settlement in what would become Missouri was at St. Louis in 1764. After being contested between Spain and France, Louisiana was ceded to the United States in 1803. The U.S. Army built Fort Osage near present-day Saint Louis as a trading post and military outpost to protect American interests in the area. In 1806, Spanish forces under General Urbino captured St. Louis. The U.S. responded by building Fort Madison a few miles downriver and attacking Spanish forces at Fort Osage.

The 8 Spruce Street building was designed by prominent Boston architect George Fowle and featured a grand entrance on Broad Street flanked by two Doric columns. The interior featured lavish marble floors and walls, marble fireplaces, and 12-foot ceilings.

The Waterhouse Hotel quickly became one of Providence's most popular tourist destinations and was visited by many notable figures in American society including President William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and Al Capone.

","Walter Coffin (1784 – 15 February 1867) was a Welsh coalowner and Member of Parliament. Coffin is recognised as the first person to exploit the rich coal fields of the Rhondda Valley on an industrial scale, becoming one of the wealthiest coal mine owners in the world. Early life
Born in 1784 he was the second son of Walter Coffin, the founder of a tanning business in Bridgend, and his second wife Anne Morgan. Coffin was descended from a well known Bridgend family, the Prices of Ty'n Ton, into which his grandfather, an owner of an estate in Selworthy, had married. Coffin was educated at Cowbridge Grammar School and later at a nonconformist academy in Exeter; in 1804 he returned to Wales to join the family business. In 1791 his father had purchased several farmsteads in the parish of Llantrisant, including the area of Dinas Uchef Farm from William Humphries. In 1809, at the age of 24 and bored with the tanning industry, Walter Coffin the younger set out to prospect for coal at his father's farm land in Dinas. He terminated the tenancy of Lewis Robert Richard at the site and with the financial support of his father began prospecting.","(223, 8)","Walter Coffin (1784 – 15 February 1867) was a United States Representative from Massachusetts.

He served as member of the state house of representatives 1820-1824 and 1832-1834. He served as member of the state senate 1836-1838 and 1840-1842.

Coffin's political career began in 1816 when he was elected to the House of Representatives from the state of New York. During his time in Congress, Coffin was known for his dedication to public service and his commitment to the principles of democracy. He was a strong advocate for the rights of the common man and worked tirelessly to ensure that the voice of the people was heard in the halls of power.

Unfortunately, he formed part of a very congested Astros outfield that included César Cedeño, César Gerónimo, Jimmy Wynn and Bob Watson, among others. Schlueter went 1-for-3 and scored one run in seven games, but never returned to the majors. After that, he went to the minors for four more seasons. He was traded along with Lee May from the Astros to the Baltimore Orioles for Enos Cabell and Rob Andrews at the Winter Meetings on December 3, 1974.

Professional Identification is a type of social
","Professional Identification is a type of social identification and is the sense of oneness individuals have with a profession (e.g. law, medicine) and the degree to which individuals define themselves as profession members. Professional identity consists of the individual's alignment of roles, responsibilities, values, and ethical standards to be consistent with practices accepted by their specific profession. Sources of professional identification 
Researchers have found that a desire for quality (rather than profits) is associated with professional identification.  Organizations tend to be concerned with efficiency and profitability, whereas professions care mainly about providing the highest-quality service (as defined by the professions), almost regardless of cost or revenue considerations (Freidson, 2001). Administrators are usually seen as promoting profitability at the expense of profession-defined quality (Freidson, 2001). In one notable study, practicing physicians viewed administrators with medical degrees (e.g., the M.D.) as “outsiders” to the medical profession because of what the physicians believed to be the administrators’ undue emphasis on organizational goals (Hoff, 1999: 336). Practicing physicians viewed administrators with MDs more negatively than those without MDs because the former were thought to have “betrayed” the medical profession by assuming administrative roles (Hoff, 1999: 344).","(237, 9)","Professional Identification is a type of social identification which allows individuals to be recognized as professionals in their field of work. It can take various forms, such as professional certificates, licenses, or membership in professional organizations.

Professional Identification can be divided into two broad categories: formal and informal. Formal professional identification typically takes the form of a credential, such as a degree, certificate, license, or membership in a professional organization. In contrast, informal professional identification is based on reputation and personal credibility. Examples of informal forms of professional identification include being known for excellence in one's field, having an outstanding record of achievements, or being well-respected by one's peers.

 Professional Identification can be important for several reasons. First, it can help individuals to be recognized as experts in their field. Second, it can help to ensure that individuals are performing their jobs properly and following safety guidelines. Third, it can help to ensure that individuals are paid fairly for their work. Finally, it can help to protect individuals from being taken advantage of by dishonest employers or clients.","(206, 11)","Professional Identification is a type of social

involves the development of a unique set of values,
attitudes, and behaviors that are specific to that

because it helps individuals to develop a sense of
purpose and meaning in their work, which can lead to
higher levels of job satisfaction and performance.

Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely
","Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used management protocol in telecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is widely used to manage optical (SONET) and broadband access infrastructure in North America. TL1 is used in the input and output messages that pass between Operations Support Systems (OSSs) and Network Elements (NEs). Operations domains such as surveillance, memory administration, and access and testing define and use TL1 messages to accomplish specific functions between the OS and the NE. TL1 is defined in Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore) Generic Requirements document GR-831-CORE. History 
TL1 was developed by Bellcore in 1984 as a standard man-machine language to manage network elements for the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). It is based on Z.300 series man machine language standards. TL1 was designed as a standard protocol readable by machines as well as humans to replace the diverse ASCII based protocols used by different Network Element (NE) vendors. It is extensible to incorporate vendor specific commands.","(189, 9)","Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used computer language for transactions, chiefly in the banking and financial services sectors. TL1 is considered an industry standard and is used in a wide variety of applications and systems, including automated teller machines (ATMs), point-of-sale systems, and securities exchanges.

TL1 is a programming language designed for use in transactions. It is an industry standard, used in a wide variety of applications and systems, including automated teller machines (ATMs), point-of-sale systems, and securities exchanges. Transactions are generally defined as the execution of an operation or set of operations on data. In banking and financial services, transactions are used to carry out day-to-day business activities such as processing payments, authorizing loans, and issuing securities.

TL1 was designed in the early 1970s by a team of programmers at American Express. TL1 was originally developed for the Amex Data Processing System (ADPS), which was one of the first large-scale transaction processing systems. ADPS was subsequently acquired by WorldCom in 1998. WorldCom continued to develop TL1 until 2003, when it was acquired by PayPal. PayPal continues to develop TL1 as part of its PayPal Transact language product line.

TL1 has been widely adopted by the banking and financial services industries because it is easy to learn and use. It is also versatile and can be used for a wide variety of applications and systems.","(261, 13)","Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely
used programming language in the field of computer science. It is known for its
simplicity and ease of use, making it an ideal choice for beginners and
intermediate programmers. TL1 was developed in the early 1990s by a team of
researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, led by Professor John
Smith. The language was designed to be easy to learn and understand, while still
being powerful enough to handle complex tasks.
One of the key features of TL1 is its
syntax, which is based on a simple set of rules that make it easy to read and
understand. The language uses a combination of keywords, variables, and
expressions to create programs that can perform a wide range of tasks. For
example, a simple ""Hello, World!"" program in TL1 might look like this:
print(""Hello, World!"")
In this example, the keyword ""print"" is used to
output the string ""Hello, World!"", while the parentheses around the string
indicate that it is a literal value. The semicolon at the end of the line is
used to indicate the end of the statement.
Another important feature of TL1 is
its support for data types. The language supports a variety of data types,
including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans. These data
types can be used to store and manipulate data within a program. For example, a
program that calculates the area of a circle might use the following code:
radius = 5.0
area = 3.14 * radius * radius
print(""The area of the circle is"", area)
In this example, we first define a variable
called ""radius"" and assign it a value of 5.0. We then calculate the area of
the circle using the formula A = πr2, where A is the area and r is the
radius. Finally, we print out the result using the ""print"" keyword.
Overall, Transaction Language 1 is a
powerful and flexible programming language that is well-suited for a wide range
of applications. Its simple syntax and support for data types make it easy to
learn and use, while its powerful features make it capable of handling complex
tasks. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, TL1 is a great
choice for your next project.","(443, 20)","Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely
used programming language.
TL1 was developed in the early 1980s by a team of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley.
The language was designed to be easy to learn and use.
It is a high-level language, which means that it can be used to write programs that are more complex than those written in a low-level language.
For example, a program written in C++ can be written in TL1, but not the other way around.
The first version of TL1 was released in 1984.
Since then, it has been updated several times.
The most recent version is TL1.5, which was released in January 2018.
The main features of TL1 are as follows:
TL1 is a procedural language.
This means that programs are written as a series of instructions that tell the computer what to do.
Each instruction is called a 'statement'.
There are many different types of statements, such as 'if' statements, 'while' statements, and 'for' statements.
Each statement has a name and a set of arguments.
The arguments are the pieces of information that the statement needs in order to do its job.
In TL1, there are two types of statements: control statements and data statements.
Control statements tell the computer how to proceed with the program.
Data statements provide the computer with the information it needs to make decisions about what to do next.
There are three types of control statements in TL1: if statements, while statements, and for statements.
An if statement is used to test whether a condition is true or false.
If the condition is true, the statement is executed; if the condition is false, it is not executed.
A while statement repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
A for statement loops through a set of instructions a certain number of times.","(358, 22)","Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely

Supported employment refers to service provisions wherein
","Supported employment refers to service provisions wherein people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, mental health, and traumatic brain injury, among others, are assisted with obtaining and maintaining employment. Supported employment is considered to be one form of employment in which wages are expected, together with benefits from an employer in a competitive workplace, though some versions refer to disability agency paid employment. Companies such as Skilcraft in the United States are an example of ""supported employment"" which is defined in law for state and federal reimbursements (by person not by agency or corporation). Community foundations of supported employment
Supported employment was developed in the United States in the 1970s as part of both vocational rehabilitation (VR) services (e.g., NYS Office of Vocational Services, 1978) and the advocacy for long term services and supports (LTSS) for individuals with significant disabilities in competitive job placements in integrated settings (e.g., businesses, offices, manufacturing facilities). Since the mid-1980s, supported employment in the professional literature primarily has referred to the ""individual placement"" model, either with job coaches or through ""natural supports"" models. The critical issue in supported employment (SE) was viewed as the need for funding for long-term services and supports (LTSS) in the community often termed beyond ""case closure"" (Griffin, Test, Dalton, & Wood, 1995). Supported employment is worldwide in 2013, though moving to new inclusive models, and the term has been used for assisting workers of diverse kinds who may need an extra jump start in the workplace; it is still associated with its roots in disability which includes community integration and deinstitutionalization","(311, 7)","Supported employment refers to service provisions wherein individuals who are unable to work due to a disability are given assistance in order to maintain their economic stability. In many cases, this assistance takes the form of financial support, but it may also take the form of help with finding a job or training.

Supported employment is a key component of many social welfare systems around the world, and it has been shown to be an effective way to help people remain economically stable. The benefits of supported employment include reduced reliance on government assistance, increased independence, and improved self-esteem.

There are a number of different types of supported employment programs, and they vary in terms of the level of assistance they provide. Some programs provide only financial support, while others provide assistance with finding a job or training. Programs typically vary in length from short-term (e.g., six months) to long-term (e.g., several years).

When Moses was seven years old, he was separated from his mother and both were not reunited for several years.  Roper was enslaved by several men in North Carolina and Florida, where after several attempts he successfully managed to escape enslavement. Roper later said he had tried to escape between 16 and 20 times and after each failed attempt, was tortured and abused at the hands of his enslaver.

The Order of Monfragüe was a Spanish
","The Order of Monfragüe  was a Spanish military order founded at the castle of Monfragüe near Plasencia on the Tagus in 1196. The order was founded by the knights of the Order of Mountjoy who dissented from a merger with the Knights Templar. The order never prospered and on 23 May 1221, by order of Ferdinand III of Castile, it was merged into the Order of Calatrava. Formation
In the twelfth century Monfragüe was the centre of a Mountjoy commandary before it became the headquarters of its own order. The earliest reference to the commandary is in an economic transaction involving the commander, Gonzalo Padilla, and his fellow brothers (freyes, freires) of the Order. As early as 1186 the Order had tried to amalgamate with the Templars but failed. The remaining decade of its existence was spent in a state of utter collapse. The Order was united in December 1187 with the Hospital of the Holy Redeemer, but already a distinction had appeared in its ranks between the master of the order, Fralmo, and his followers on one hand and the commander of the Order in the Kingdom of Castile, Rodrigo González, and his support. By mid-1188 there was a schism in the Order, though it does not appear to have broken down along the lines Castile and León on one hand and the Crown of Aragon on the other, as sometimes supposed. When the final split occurred in 1196, over the successful amalgamation with the Templars, all opponents of the merger would have had to leave the lands of Alfonso II of Aragon, a strong supporter of the Temple.","(297, 10)","The Order of Monfragüe  was a military and civil order of Spain.

The military order consisted of four grades, while the civil order consisted of six grades. The insignia for both orders was a red cross pattee on a white field. The orders also had a motto: ""Nemo me impune lacessit"" (Nobody harms me without punishment).

Owen Aldis (1926–2001) was a behavioural psychologist.
","Owen Aldis (1926–2001) was a behavioural psychologist. He was born into a notable Chicago family. His father was one of the trustees of the University of Chicago and ran a real estate management firm, his mother a writer of children's poetry and his maternal grandfather on the editor of the Chicago Tribune.  Aldis taught economics at Yale University and worked in investment in New York. But in the 1950s he moved west to San Francisco's Bay Area and began to develop his academic interest in behavioral psychology. He is most noted for his well received 1971 publication Play Fighting which is an ethological classic examining play in humans and animals. The study was based on extensive observational studies: 1,500 hours of field observation on humans, 700 hours of observations on animals at four California zoos and more than twenty hours of filmed playing humans and various animals. He was a member of the International Society for Human Ethology.","(173, 8)","Owen Aldis (1926–2001) was a behavioural psychologist. He is chiefly known for his work on reinforcement learning, for which he was awarded the prestigious John von Neumann Medal in 1990.

Aldis was born in 1926 in London, England. He received his B.Sc. from the University of London in 1948 and his M.Sc. from the University of Cambridge in 1950. Aldis worked as a research assistant at the University of Cambridge from 1950 to 1952, and then moved to the United States to work as a research associate at the Rand Corporation from 1952 to 1955. Aldis returned to England, and became a lecturer at the University of Cambridge from 1955 to 1958. He moved to the United States again, this time to become a professor at Yale University in 1958. Aldis remained at Yale until his retirement in 2001.

Aldis's work primarily focused on reinforcement learning, which is a field of study that deals with the behaviour of agents who learn by trial and error. He is largely credited with being one of the pioneers of this field, and has written several landmark papers on the topic. Aldis was also known for his work on decision theory, which focuses on the problems that agents face when making decisions under uncertainty.

Aldis died in 2001, at the age of 78.","(245, 14)","Owen Aldis (1926–2001) was a behavioural psychologist.
He made significant contributions to the field of psychology, particularly in the areas of operant conditioning and behaviour analysis.
Aldis received his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1953.
After completing his doctoral studies, he joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he spent the majority of his academic career.
Aldis's research focused on the use of operant conditioning techniques to modify human behavior.
He was particularly interested in the application of these techniques to the treatment of psychological disorders, such as phobias and anxiety disorders.
One of Aldis's most notable contributions to psychology was his development of the ""Aldis Method"" of behavior modification.
This method involved the use of positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors and the use of negative reinforcement to discourage unwanted behaviors.
Aldis believed that this approach could be used to effectively treat a wide range of psychological disorders.
In addition to his research, Aldis was also an influential teacher and mentor to many students and colleagues.
He was known for his ability to inspire and motivate his students, and many of his former students went on to become successful psychologists in their own right.
