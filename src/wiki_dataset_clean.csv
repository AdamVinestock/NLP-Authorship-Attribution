Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic ","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands.
	
The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.","(288, 11)","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups inhabiting the Maluku Islands. The term ""Moluccan"" is an umbrella term that covers the various Austronesian and Papuan languages spoken on the islands. The largest group of Moluccans are the Tolo-speaking people.

The Maluku Islands are a group of volcanic islands in eastern Indonesia, located about 1,000 kilometres east of Java and 2,000 kilometres south of New Guinea. The islands comprise over 700 islands, with a total land area of approximately 245,000 square kilometres. They have a population of around 1 million people, most of whom are Muslim. The largest island group is the Tolo-speaking region, which comprises over 60% of the population.

The Moluccas were first explored by Europeans in 1512. Portuguese explorer João da Nova discovered Ternate and Tidore, while Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen discovered Halmahera and Bougainville. The Moluccas were later visited by Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. British explorer James Cook visited Ternate, Tidore, Halmahera, and Bougainville during his first voyage in 1770–71.","(188, 11)","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic  groups native to the Maluku Islands, also known as the Moluccas, in eastern Indonesia. The term ""Moluccan"" encompasses various ethnic groups, including the Ambonese, Ternate, Tidore, and others, each with their distinct culture, language, and traditions. Historically, the Moluccans played a significant role in the spice trade, particularly in the production and export of cloves, nutmeg, and other valuable spices. The islands' strategic location made them a prized possession for various colonial powers, including the Portuguese, Dutch, and British.

The Moluccans have a rich cultural heritage, with a blend of Austronesian and Papuan influences. Their languages, such as Ambonese Malay and Ternate, are part of the Austronesian language family, while their customs and traditions reflect a mix of indigenous and Islamic practices. The Moluccans are predominantly Muslim, with a significant minority practicing Christianity.

Efforts are being made to preserve their cultural heritage and promote sustainable development in the region. The Maluku Islands are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including several endemic species found nowhere else in the world.

The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly ","The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinent containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. 
These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian and Bantu settlers. Despite popular belief, there has been no genetic input from Arabs or Indians, although one tribe, the Antemoro, claims descent from Somali Arab traders. European and Middle eastern paternal ancestry is also present.","(217, 7)","The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly from that of neighbouring islands by its unique blend of traditional and colonial influences. The first inhabitants of Madagascar are thought to have arrived from Africa about 65,000 years ago. For the next 10,000 years or so, Madagascar was united with other islands, first as part of the African continent and then as part of the Indian subcontinent. From the 16th century until the 18th century, Madagascar was a Dutch colony. In 1795 it became a French colony. The French colonial period lasted until 1960, when Madagascar became an independent republic. 

Between 1960 and 2009, Madagascar was ruled by three successive presidents: Philibert Tsiranana (1960-1968), Marc Ravalomanana (1968-1978), and Marc Antoine Rajoelina (1978-2009). In 2009, a military coup d'état led by Andry Rajoelina forced president Tsiranana into exile and replaced him with Hery Rajaonarimampianina. Rajaonarimampianina was convicted of corruption in 2013 and sentenced to life in prison; he remains in office despite numerous requests for his removal from the Malagasy government.

Alonso de Ojeda (; c. 1466 – ","Alonso de Ojeda  (; c. 1466 – c. 1515) was a Spanish explorer, governor and conquistador. He travelled through modern-day Guyana, Venezuela, Trinidad, Tobago, Curaçao, Aruba and Colombia. He navigated with Amerigo Vespucci who is famous for having named Venezuela, which he explored during his first two expeditions, for having been the first European to visit Guyana, Curaçao, Colombia, and  Lake Maracaibo, and later for founding Santa Cruz (La Guairita). Early life 
Alonso de Ojeda was born in Torrejoncillo del Rey, New Castile around 1466. His father, Rodrigo de Huete, was a minor noble who fought for Isabel in 1474 during the War of the Castilian Succession. Isabel was grateful for his support and put his son, Alonso, under her protection. In his youth, Alonso served the Duke of Medinaceli, Luis de la Cerda. In service to the duke, he distinguished himself in the conquest of Granada with his military abilities, his skill as a swordsman and his bravery.","(192, 8)","Alonso de Ojeda  (; c. 1466 – c. 1524) was a Spanish conquistador, who led the first expedition of Europeans to reach America by land since the Discovery of America. He is considered the first European explorer of the Americas.

Ojeda was born in Palencia, Spain circa 1466. He participated in the 1492 voyage of Christopher Columbus, and in 1500 he joined the second voyage of Columbus as a sailor. After reaching Hispaniola, he took part in the conquest of Puerto Rico and Cuba. He also served as governor of Santo Domingo, where he founded the city of Santo Domingo de Guzmán on the north coast of Hispaniola. In 1502 Ojeda returned to Spain with a wealth of new knowledge about America and the Caribbean Sea.

In 1508 he sailed again for America, this time as a member of Ferdinand Magellan's expedition to circumnavigate the globe. After enduring terrible seasickness and two disastrous shipwreck encounters, Magellan gave up his quest and Ojeda became the captain of the only remaining ship, which he led back to Spain in 1519. Along the way, he discovered Guam and claimed it for Spain. Ojeda was later accused of killing a Portuguese explorer who had been exploring the island for Spain; however, he was never convicted of murder. 

Ojeda died in Cádiz or Seville around 1524, aged about 66 years old.","(253, 12)","Alonso de Ojeda (; c. 1466 – 1515) was a Spanish explorer and conquistador who played a significant role in the early European exploration of the Americas.

""Cheerleader"" is a song recorded by Jamaican ","""Cheerleader"" is a song recorded by Jamaican singer and songwriter Omi. The track was written and produced by OMI and Clifton Dillon, Mark Bradford, and Ryan Dillon. OMI first began developing the song in 2008, when he created its melody. It was refined over several years alongside famed Jamaican producer Clifton Dillon. It was first recorded with veteran session musicians Sly and Robbie and Dean Fraser. Released as a single on independent label Oufah, the song saw success in Jamaica, where it topped the charts, and also attracted airplay in Hawaii and Dubai. Ultra contacted two disc jockeys to produce remixed versions of the original song. The label and song's producers preferred one remix, produced by a young German DJ, Felix Jaehn, that eschewed much of the song's original instrumentation for a tropical-flavored deep house rendition, prominently featuring a trumpet, a conga beat, and piano. A remix extended play was released in May 2015 by Ultra, which began to first see commercial success that fall.

Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method ","Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method by which developers can purchase the development rights of certain parcels within a designated ""sending district"" and transfer the rights to another ""receiving district"" to increase the density of their new development. The underlying legal concept of a transfer of development rights programme is the notion that all land has a bundle of property rights. It is used for controlling land use to complement land-use planning and zoning for more effective urban growth management and land conservation. Description 
The TDR process can be considered a tool for controlling urban sprawl by concentrating development. TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of development control. In the United States, TDR are also a way to avoid constitutional takings issues caused by rezoning areas that would otherwise eliminate a significant amount of value from the property. The procedure offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of the environmental, heritage or agricultural values of their land. TDR is based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or land development. These land-based development rights can in some jurisdictions be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred by the owner of a parcel. ","(232, 9)","Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method of transferring development rights in a project from the original developer to another party. The term is most commonly used in the context of real estate development.

The purpose of TDR is to provide a way for the original developer to relinquish control of a project without having to sell the property or give up any ownership rights. This can be useful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the property.

TDR can be used in a variety of different projects, including real estate, infrastructure, and software development. Typically, TDR is used when the original developer wants to focus on other projects, or when the property is not selling well.

There are a number of different methods for transferring TDRs. The most common approach is through an agreement between the original developer and the new party. Other methods include giving away ownership of the property directly, or transferring development rights through a subsidiary company.

There are several advantages to using TDRs. First, it can provide a way for the original developer to exit a project without having to give up any ownership rights. This can be helpful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the project.

Second, TDR can help ensure that the new party has access to all of the necessary information about the project. This can help ensure that the project is completed as planned, and that any changes made by the new party are properly reflected in the","(290, 14)","Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method  of land-use planning that allows property owners to transfer their development rights to other parcels of land within a designated area. This approach is often used as a tool for preserving open space, farmland, and natural resources while still allowing for development to occur. TDR programs typically involve the creation of a ""sending area"" where development rights are restricted, and a ""receiving area"" where these rights can be transferred and used to increase the density or intensity of development. By transferring development rights, property owners in the sending area are incentivized to preserve their land in its current state, while property owners in the receiving area are able to develop their land more intensively. TDR programs can be implemented at the local, state, or national level, and are often used in conjunction with other land-use planning tools, such as zoning ordinances and conservation easements. The use of TDR has been shown to be an effective way to balance the need for development with the need to preserve natural resources and open space. TDR programs have been implemented in many countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. The success of TDR programs depends on a variety of factors, including the design of the program, the availability of receiving areas, and the level of community support.

In 2018, the district had a population of 3023. The main industries are tourism, wine production and fishing. The island has been famous for its grapes, wines and red poppies for centuries. It is a former bishopric and presently a Latin Catholic titular see. Tenedos is mentioned in both the Iliad and the Aeneid, in the latter as the site where the Greeks hid their fleet near the end of the Trojan War in order to trick the Trojans into believing the war was over and into taking the Trojan Horse within their city walls. The island was important throughout classical antiquity despite its small size due to its strategic location at the entrance of the Dardanelles. In the following centuries, the island came under the control of a succession of regional powers, including the Achaemenid Persian Empire, the Delian League, the empire of Alexander the Great, the Kingdom of Pergamon, the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire, before passing to the Republic of Venice. As a result of the War of Chioggia (1381) between Genoa and Venice the entire population was evacuated and the town was demolished. The Ottoman Empire established control over the deserted island in 1455. During Ottoman rule, it was resettled by both Greeks and Turks. In 1807, the island was temporarily occupied by the Russians. During this invasion the town was burnt down and many Turkish residents left the island.","(322, 15)","Tenedos (, Tenedhos, ), or Bozcaada in Turkish, is an Aegean island in Turkey.

She created leading roles in many opéras comiques including  the title role in ""La marquise de Brinvilliers"", a collaborative work between nine composers, and in works by Fromental Halévy, Ambroise Thomas, and others. Considered one of the major stars of the lyric stage of her day, Prévost was esteemed for her  unaffected stage presence, her charm of person and manner, her skills as a comic actress, and her excellent singing technique. She created the leading soprano roles in two opéras comiques still performed today, Zerlina in ""Fra Diavolo"" by Auber in 1830 and Madeleine in ""Le postillon de Lonjumeau"" by Adam in 1836, the most successful works of those two composers.

Many of her songs, such as, ""Will ye no' come back again?"", ""Charlie is my Darling"" , ""The Rowan Tree"" and ""Wi' a Hundred Pipers' remain popular today, almost two hundred years after they were written. One of her songs, ""Caller Herrin'"", was sung at the 2021 commemoration of the 1881 Eyemouth disaster. She usually set her words to traditional Scottish folk melodies, but sometimes contributed her own music. Carolina Nairne and her contemporary Robert Burns were influenced by the Jacobite heritage in their establishment of a distinct Scottish identity, through what they both called national song. Perhaps in the belief that her work would not be taken seriously if it were known that she was a woman, Nairne went to considerable lengths to conceal her identity (even from her husband) when submitting her work for publication. Early on she called herself Mrs Bogan of Bogan, but feeling that gave too much away she often attributed her songs to the gender-neutral B.B., S.M., or ""Unknown"".","(242, 8)","Carolina Oliphant, Lady Nairne (16 August 1766 – 8 September 1837) was an Irish aristocrat, beauty and writer.

The Make-Up is an American post-punk band ","The Make-Up is an American post-punk band from Washington, D.C. formed in 1995, consisting of ex-Nation of Ulysses frontman Ian Svenonius on vocals, James Canty on guitar and organ, Steve Gamboa on drums, and Michelle Mae on bass guitar.  The Make-Up were joined in late 1999 by a fifth member, Alex Minoff (of the groups Golden and Extra Golden), who played guitar with the group until the band's dissolution in early 2000. The Make-Up combined garage rock, soul, and a self-styled liberation theology to make a new genre they called ""Gospel Yeh-Yeh"".  This style led to an emphasis on live performances and interaction between the band and their audience, incorporating the audience into the performances as a ""fifth member"", creating what one reviewer described as """"highly energetic and participatory live shows"". Parallel to the band's gospel musical stylings, the Make-Up produced music under a communism-influenced political philosophy that they saw as counter to the capitalist form of modern rock and roll and pop music.","(192, 5)","The Make-Up is an American post-punk band from Chicago, Illinois. Active from 1978 to 1992, the band was one of the earliest American bands to combine punk rock with heavy metal and progressive rock influences.

Formed in 1978, the Make-Up quickly became one of the leading lights of Chicago's burgeoning post-punk scene. Their blend of punk energy and heavy metal intensity placed them firmly at the forefront of a movement that was beginning to take shape in the city. 

The Make-Up's self-titled debut album was released in 1980 and quickly established them as one of Chicago's most popular and influential bands. The album was well received by both critics and fans alike, earning them a reputation as one of the city's most promising new bands. 

The following year saw the release of their second album, which saw the band expanding their sound further into progressive territory. The album was again well received by both fans and critics, and cemented the Make-Up's position as one of Chicago's leading post-punk outfits. 

In 1982, the Make-Up released their third album, which marked a significant change in direction for the band. Recorded at Studio 4 in London with production by David Bowie producer Tony Visconti, the album saw the band abandoning their punk roots in favour of a more experimental sound.

Led by vocalist and guitarist Ian Svenonius, the Make-Up is known for their energetic live performances and experimental approach to songwriting. The band's sound is marked by Svenonius's distinctive vocals and lyrics, which often explore themes of social critique, politics, and personal relationships. With a career spanning over two decades, the Make-Up has released numerous albums and EPs on labels such as Dischord Records and Kill Rock Stars, earning them a reputation as one of the most innovative and influential bands to emerge from the post-punk revival of the 1990s. Through their music and live performances, the Make-Up continues to push the boundaries of what is possible within the post-punk genre, inspiring a new generation of musicians and fans alike. The band's influence can be heard in a wide range of musical styles, from indie rock to noise rock and beyond. ### | End of Response | ### ### | Instruction | ###

Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, ","Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, rebuilt in 1761 as a Scottish Gothic style Palladian manor, with clear evidence of prehistoric use of the site. It is situated immediately west of the town of Stonehaven in Kincardineshire, slightly to the west of the A90 dual carriageway.  Other notable historic fortified houses or castles in this region are Dunnottar Castle, Muchalls Castle, Fiddes Castle, Cowie Castle and Monboddo House. Prehistory
From cropmarks in the ""policies"" (improved areas) around Fetteresso Castle, there is evidence of a ring ditch sited at the north end of a cursus.  A cursus is a prehistoric set of parallel linear structures of unknown purpose that were, somewhat fancifully, considered by antiquarians as used for some type of athletic competition, possibly related to hunting or archery; this is unsubstantiated. In 1822 a cairn was discovered near Fetteresso Castle with some human remains inside. The size and shape of the chamber made of unhewn whinstone clearly show that the burial site was a Bronze Age construct. Some legends say that this is the grave of Malcolm I, who is recorded to have been slain at Fetteresso in AD 954. The burial hillock has become known as Malcolm's Mount, even though it is not likely from current archaeological analysis that the crypt could be so recent. In 1998 a burial urn from the Beaker people was found at Fetteresso Castle. The Roman Camp of Raedykes is located several miles north-west, where a full legion encamped and many archaeological recoveries have been made. This location is one of a string of marching camps that connected Angus to Moray.","(299, 12)","Fetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, located in the village of Fetteresso, in the Scottish Borders.

Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map ","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map design, is a property of a map in which the map image can be partitioned into a single feature or type of feature that is considered as an object of attention (the figure), with the remainder of the map being relegated to the background, outside the current focus of attention. It is thus based on the concept of figure–ground from Gestalt psychology. For example, in a street map with strong figure-ground contrast, the reader would be able to isolate and focus attention on individual features, like a given street, park, or lake, as well as layers of related features, like the street network. Strong figure-ground contrast has been seen as a desirable goal of map design, because it helps the map reader to perceive distinct geographic phenomena in the map. This allows more complex composition techniques such as visual hierarchy to organize these phenomena into clear structures that help readers use the map for its intended purposes.","(183, 5)","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of mapmaking, is the difference between the shapes and sizes of the features depicted on a map and the spaces around them. The term generally applies to maps of real or imaginary landscapes, but can also be used for maps of abstract concepts.

Figure-ground contrast is an important consideration in mapmaking because it affects how viewers interact with a map. For instance, if most of the features on a map are large and well-defined, viewers may feel overwhelmed and lose their sense of orientation. If, on the other hand, most features are small and subtle, viewers may be more likely to notice and appreciate them.

In cartography, figure-ground contrast is often achieved through the use of scale. Large features are typically drawn at a larger scale than smaller features, in order to make them more noticeable. Conversely, smaller features are typically drawn at a smaller scale than larger features, in order to preserve their visibility.

Figure-ground contrast is also important for portraying information on a map. For instance, if a map contains a lot of information about one specific area, it may be difficult to see if that information is balanced among the various features on the map. By contrasting large areas with small areas, cartographers can help to improve legibility.","(242, 11)","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map  design and cartography, refers to the visual distinction between foreground and background elements on a map. It is a fundamental concept in cartographic design, where the goal is to create a clear and effective visual hierarchy that guides the viewer's attention through the use of contrasting colors, textures, and other visual elements. A well-designed figure-ground contrast can enhance the legibility and understandability of a map, while a poorly designed one can lead to visual clutter and confusion. In cartography, figure-ground contrast is often achieved through the use of different colors, line weights, and typography to differentiate between various map features, such as roads, buildings, and bodies of water. By carefully balancing figure-ground contrast, cartographers can create maps that are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally effective, allowing users to quickly and easily interpret the spatial relationships and patterns depicted on the map.

Figure-ground contrast plays a crucial role in map design as it enables cartographers to create visually appealing and effective maps that facilitate easy interpretation of spatial relationships and patterns. A well-balanced figure-ground contrast helps to:
1. Guide the viewer's attention: By creating a clear visual hierarchy, cartographers can direct the viewer's attention to the most important information on the map.
2. Enhance legibility: Figure-ground contrast helps to distinguish between different map features, making it easier for users to read and understand the map.

In cartography, the term is used to describe the contrast between the most important information on a map (the map's ""figure"") and the less important information on the map (its ""ground"").
The figure-ground contrast is an important part of map design, as it helps the viewer understand what is important on the map and what is less important.
The most important thing to remember when designing a map with a strong figure-ground relationship is to make sure that the most important parts of the map are the ones that stand out the most.

By carefully balancing figure-ground contrast, cartographers can create maps that are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally effective, allowing users to quickly and easily interpret the spatial relationships and patterns depicted on the map. Effective use of figure-ground contrast is essential in various fields, including urban planning, navigation, and geographic research. ","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map (or cartographic) design, refers to the contrast between a map's background and its foreground.
The foreground is the part of the map that contains the map's most important information, while the background is the part that contains less important information.
The term ""figure-ground"" comes from the visual arts, where it refers to the relationship between the subject of a work of art and its background.
In cartography, the term is used to describe the contrast between the most important information on a map (the map's ""figure"") and the less important information on the map (its ""ground"").
The figure-ground contrast is an important part of map design, as it helps the viewer understand what is important on the map and what is less important.
The most important thing to remember when designing a map with a strong figure-ground relationship is to make sure that the most important parts of the map are the ones that stand out the most.
This can be done by using bold colors, large fonts, and other design elements that make the most important things on the map stand out.","(189, 6)","(220, 7)"

In the 1883 season he played five matches for the county in which he took a respectable number of wickets, most notably against Sussex with 6 for 27 and another 4 to make a ten wicket match. His most successful season of 1884, saw him play twelve matches and take 34 wickets at 19.97. He took 5 for 43 against MCC, 5 for 31 against Kent which included a hat trick, 5 for 40 against Surrey and his career best of 7 for 46 against Yorkshire.

Marlow was born in London, England, the son of a bookseller. He attended school in London and then studied law at the University of Cambridge, but he abandoned his studies to become a journalist. He worked as a reporter for several newspapers before becoming editor of the Sunday Times in 1892.

Marlow's first novel, The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1892), was based on the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. His other novels include The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886), The Black Dog (1892), and The House of Mirth (1905).

Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated ","Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of an innocent person by means of capital punishment; therefore, it is a subset of wrongful execution. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as ""death inflicted by process of law, capital punishment, esp. considered to be unjust or cruel"". Example
An early case in which charges of judicial murder were raised was the Amboyna massacre in 1623, which caused a legal dispute between the English and Dutch governments over the conduct of a court in the Dutch East Indies that had ordered the execution of ten English men accused of treason. The dispute centered around differing interpretations of the legal jurisdiction of the court in question. The English believed that this court had not been competent to try and execute these EIC members, and so believed the executions to have been fundamentally illegal, thus constituting ""judicial murder"". The Dutch, on the other hand, believed the court to have been fundamentally competent, and wished to focus instead on misconduct of the particular judges in the court.","(194, 7)","Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of a judge, prosecutor, or other judicial officer. It is a form of assassination.

Judicial murder is a form of assassination that has been seen in many countries around the world. Judicial murder is most commonly associated with countries that have a history of instability and corruption. In some cases, judicial murder has been used to quash investigations into political corruption and to remove political opponents from power. Judicial murder can also be used to intimidate judges and prosecutors from carrying out their duties.

Judicial murder can take many different forms. Some examples include: shooting or bombarding a judge or prosecutor as they leave work or court; poisoning or smothering a judge or prosecutor in their sleep; rigging trials against the victim; or kidnapping and torturing the victim in order to extract information about their investigation into political corruption.

Judicial murder is a serious threat to the integrity of the justice system and the rule of law. It undermines the public's confidence in the judiciary and can lead to a spiral of corruption and violence. Governments must take measures to protect judges and prosecutors from attack, and they must ensure that investigations into judicial murder are carried out vigorously and impartially.","(229, 11)","Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated  killing of a person by agents of the state, such as law enforcement officers, prison guards, or other government officials, while the victim is in custody or under the jurisdiction of the state. This term is often used interchangeably with the concept of extrajudicial killing, although judicial murder typically implies a more formal and deliberate process. Judicial murder can occur in various contexts, including during arrest, interrogation, detention, or execution, and may involve physical violence, torture, or other forms of mistreatment. The phenomenon of judicial murder has been documented throughout history and across different regions, with notable examples including the lynching of African Americans in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and the forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings carried out by authoritarian regimes in Latin America and other parts of the world. Judicial murder often raises concerns about the rule of law, human rights, and the accountability of state agents. In many cases, judicial murder goes unpunished due to a lack of transparency, inadequate investigations, or corruption within the justice system.

The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as ","The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as the caper family, are a family of plants in the order Brassicales. As currently circumscribed, the family contains 33 genera and about 700 species. The largest genera are Capparis (about 150 species), Maerua (about 100 species), Boscia (37 species) and Cadaba (30 species). Taxonomy 
The Capparaceae have long been considered closely related to and have often been included in the Brassicaceae, the mustard family (APG, 1998), in part because both groups produce glucosinolate (mustard oil) compounds. Subsequent molecular studies support Capparaceae sensu stricto as paraphyletic with respect to the Brassicaceae. However Cleome and several related genera are more closely related to members of the Brassicaceae than to the other Capparaceae. These genera are now either placed in the Brassicaceae (as subfamily Clemoideae) or segregated into the Cleomaceae. Several more genera of the traditional Capparaceae are more closely related to other members of the Brassicales, and the relationships of several more remain unresolved. Based on morphological grounds and supported by molecular studies, the American species traditionally identified as Capparis have been transferred to resurrected generic names. Several new genera have also been recently described.","(226, 10)","The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as capers, is a family of flowering plants in the order Capitatae. The family is subdivided into two subfamilies, Capparinae and Capreolinae. There are about 165 genera and 2,000 species of capers, distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical climates.

The capers are a terrestrial or semiterrestrial family of flowering plants. They are herbs or small shrubs, with fleshy leaves that are either alternate or opposite and entire or toothed. The flowers are arranged in spikelike inflorescences, each with a few small sepals and petals. The fruit is a tiny Capsicum, typically a pepper but sometimes a fruit that resembles a tomato. The genus Capparis contains the typical capers (Capparis spinosa) and the related genus Ceratonia contains the false capers (Ceratonia siliqua), which have edible fruits resembling those of the true capers.

The capers are native to Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Asia Minor, and North America. They have been naturalized in many other parts of the world. They grow best in slightly alkaline soil with good drainage and moderate fertility.","(206, 11)","The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as  the caper family, is a family of flowering plants in the order Brassicales.

The Capparaceae family is characterized by its diverse range of plants, including trees, shrubs, and herbaceous perennials.

It is found in east Africa from Somalia to Mozambique, and south to Namibia and Botswana.

The Alström's warbler is a small passerine bird, measuring 14–16 cm in length. The male has a plain brown back and wings, while the female is much paler with a more extensive white band across the breast. The underparts are also white, shading to buff on the belly.

Sam Poo (died 19 December 1865) was ","Sam Poo (died 19 December 1865) was a Chinese bushranger in Australia who was active in New South Wales during early 1865. Poo emigrated to Australia in the early 1860s during the gold rush. Being an unsuccessful miner, he turned to bushranging. He robbed travellers on the Gulgong–Mudgee for several weeks. On 3 February 1865, Poo killed Senior Constable John Ward, who was looking for him. After the murder of Ward, the New South Wales Police organised a large-scale manhunt, which lasted two weeks and resulted in Poo being arrested and seriously injured during his arrest.  Poo was tried two times after his arrest. The first time on 10 April, he was tried for shooting with intent to kill at Aboriginal tracker Henry Hughes during his arrest and he was found guilty by the jury. The second time on 10 October, he was tried for the wilful murder of John Ward and he was again found guilty by the jury. He was sentenced to death and he was executed by hanging on 19 December 1865. Poo was fictionalised in David Martin's novel The Hero of Too (1965) and since has been a theme of a circus show, a children's novel and a planned feature film.","(230, 11)","Sam Poo (died 19 December 1865) was an English cricketer.

Poo was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast. He was born at Headington, Oxfordshire.

Poo made his first-class debut for Oxford University against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1851. He made two further first-class appearances for the university, both of which came in 1851. In his three appearances, Poo scored a total of 7 runs at an average of 2.50, with a high score of 3 not out. Additionally, he took 4 wickets with a bowling average of 10.50.

In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective ","In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that sees social behavior as an interactive product of the individual and the situation. In other words, it derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from social interaction, whereby subjectively held meanings are integral to explaining or understanding social behavior. This perspective studies the ways in which individuals shape, and are shaped by, society through their interactions. Interactionism thus argues that the individual is an active and conscious piece of the social-context system, rather than merely a passive object in their environment. It believes interactions to be guided by meanings that are attached to the self, to others with whom each individual interacts, and to situations of interaction; all of which are altered in interaction themselves. In this sense, interactionism may stand in contrast to studies of socialization, insofar as interactionism conceives individuals to influence groups at least as much as groups influence individuals.","(174, 6)","In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in human behaviour. It is a philosophical and methodological approach that began to develop in the 1940s and 1950s and has been influential in sociology, anthropology, and psychology.

Interactionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in human behaviour. It is a philosophical and methodological approach that began to develop in the 1940s and 1950s and has been influential in sociology, anthropology, and psychology. The basic idea is that humans are not just individual actors but are also members of social groups, which shapes their behaviour. Social interaction is thus seen as a key factor in understanding human behaviour.

Interactionism has a number of important implications for sociology. First, it emphasises the role of social norms and values in shaping behaviour.Second, it emphasises the importance of contextuality in understanding human behaviour. Finally, it stresses the importance of social interaction as a means of learning and understanding behaviour.

Interactionism has also had an important impact on the methodology of sociology. It has led to the development of social process theory and action research, two important methodological approaches within sociology.","(217, 11)","In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective  that emphasizes the importance of social interactions and relationships in shaping individual behavior and society as a whole. This perspective posits that people's actions, thoughts, and feelings are derived from their interactions with others, and that these interactions are the fundamental building blocks of social reality. Interactionists argue that social structures, institutions, and norms are not fixed or objective, but rather are created and sustained through ongoing interactions among individuals. By focusing on the dynamic and fluid nature of social interactions, interactionism highlights the agency and creativity of individuals in shaping their own lives and the social world around them. This perspective has been influential in fields such as sociology, anthropology, and psychology, and has been used to study a wide range of topics, including deviance, identity, and power dynamics. Overall, interactionism offers a nuanced and contextualized understanding of social life, one that recognizes the complex and multifaceted nature of human experience. ### | End of Response | ###

Born in Thiruvarur, she was brought up at Moovalur, a village near Mayiladhuthurai. She was the author of the 1936 novel Dasigalin Mosavalai alladhu madhi pettra minor (lit. Devadasis' web of deceit or the minor grown wise) which exposed the plight of the Devadasis. Originally a supporter of the nationalist Indian National Congress, she became a member of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement after Periyar left the Congress in 1925. In 1930, she supported Muthulakshmi Reddi's failed attempt to abolish the Devadasi system in the Presidency through legislation. She took part in the Anti-Hindi agitations of 1937-40 and in November 1938, was jailed for six weeks for participating in the agitations. The public awareness created by her novel and her continuous campaign to abolish the Devadasi system, were instrumental in the passage of the Madras Devadasi (Prevention of Dedication) Act or the Devadasi Abolition Bill, which outlawed the practice in 1947. In 1949, she parted ways with Periyar. She became a supporter of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a new party started by Periyar's protégé C. N. Annadurai. She remained a DMK supporter till her death in 1962.

Burning Bush is a 2013 three-part miniseries ","Burning Bush  is a 2013 three-part miniseries created for HBO by Polish director Agnieszka Holland. Based on real characters and events, this haunting drama focuses on the personal sacrifice of a Prague history student, Jan Palach, who set himself on fire in 1969 in protest against the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia in the previous year. Dagmar Burešová, a young female lawyer, became part of his legacy by defending Palach's family in a trial against the communist government, a regime which tried to dishonour Palach’s sacrifice, a heroic action for the freedom of Czechoslovakia. The fight for freedom, for moral principles, self-sacrifice and protest in those desperate times led to the moral unification of a repressed nation, which twenty years later defeated the totalitarian regime. The anniversary of Jan Palach’s death inspired a new generation of students to start protests that led to the eventual fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, part of the eventual destruction of the Iron Curtain.","(179, 5)","Burning Bush  is a 2013 three-part Australian miniseries directed by Belinda McClaren.

Global aphasia is a severe form of ","Global aphasia is a severe form of nonfluent aphasia, caused by damage to the left side of the brain, that affects receptive and expressive language skills (needed for both written and oral language) as well as auditory and visual comprehension. Acquired impairments of communicative abilities are present across all language modalities, impacting language production, comprehension, and repetition. Patients with global aphasia may be able to verbalize a few short utterances and use non-word neologisms, but their overall production ability is limited. Their ability to repeat words, utterances, or phrases is also affected. Due to the preservation of the right hemisphere, an individual with global aphasia may still be able to express themselves through facial expressions, gestures, and intonation. This type of aphasia often results from a large lesion of the left perisylvian cortex. The lesion is caused by an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and is associated with damage to Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and insular regions which are associated with aspects of language. Signs and symptoms
It is most common for the onset of global aphasia to occur after a thrombotic stroke (at the trunk of the middle cerebral artery), with varying severity. The general signs and symptoms include the inability to understand, create, and repeat speech and language.  These difficulties also persist in reading, writing, and auditory comprehension abilities.
Verbal language typically consists of a few recognizable utterances and words (e.g., hello), overlearned phrases (e.g., how are you), and expletives (e.g., a curse word). However, those affected by global aphasia may express themselves using facial expressions, intonation, and gestures.  Extensive lexical (vocabulary) impairment is possible, resulting in an inability to read simple words or sentences. Global aphasia may be accompanied by weakness of the right side of the face and right hemiplegia (paralysis), but can occur with or without hemiparesis (weakness). Additionally, it is common for an individual with global aphasia to have one or more of the following additional impairments: apraxia of speech, alexia, pure word deafness, agraphia, facial apraxia, and depression.","(405, 15)","Global aphasia is a severe form of aphasia that affects all languages, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in producing spoken words and understanding spoken language. It is a disorder of the left hemisphere of the brain, and is more common in older people. It can be caused by a stroke, brain tumour, or head injury.

It is a disorder of the left hemisphere of the brain, and is more common in older people. It can be caused by a stroke, brain tumour, or head injury.

There is no known cure for global aphasia, but there are treatments available that can help improve language skills. Treatment typically includes speech therapy to help improve pronunciation and fluency, as well as rehabilitation programmes that focus on teaching essential daily living skills such as cooking and bathing. Some people may also require assistance with everyday activities such as reading and writing.

If you are affected by global aphasia, remember that you are not alone. There are many people who have faced challenges in their lives, but have managed to overcome them. You can too!","(233, 12)","Global aphasia is a severe form of  aphasia, a neurological disorder that affects an individual's ability to communicate effectively. Characterized by significant impairments in both expressive and receptive language skills, global aphasia is typically caused by damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, often resulting from a stroke or traumatic brain injury. This condition is distinct from other forms of aphasia, such as Broca's aphasia or Wernicke's aphasia, which exhibit more specific patterns of language impairment.

Individuals with global aphasia often struggle to understand spoken language, comprehend written text, and express their thoughts and ideas through verbal or written communication. Their speech may be limited to a few words or phrases, and they may rely heavily on nonverbal cues, such as gestures and facial expressions, to convey meaning. In some cases, people with global aphasia may not be able to speak at all, relying instead on augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) methods, such as picture communication symbols or electronic devices.

The severity of global aphasia can vary significantly from person to person, with some individuals exhibiting more residual language abilities than others. Factors that influence the extent of language impairment include the location and extent of brain damage, as well as the individual's pre-morbid language abilities and cognitive reserve. In general, however, individuals with global aphasia face significant challenges in their daily lives, including difficulties with communication, social interaction, and participation in work or educational activities.

Despite the challenges posed by global aphasia, many individuals with this condition are able to adapt and compensate for their language impairments through the use of assistive technology, communication strategies, and support from family, friends, and healthcare professionals. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) play a crucial role in the assessment and treatment of global aphasia, working with individuals to develop personalized communication plans and provide ongoing support and therapy.

Research on global aphasia has focused on understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of language processing and developing effective interventions to improve communication outcomes. Studies have employed a range of methodologies, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and behavioral experiments, to investigate the cognitive and neural correlates of global aphasia. These efforts aim to improve our understanding of this complex condition and inform the development of evidence-based treatments and support services for individuals affected by global aphasia.

Born to a peasant family, Rodin was drafted into the Red Army in 1920. After fighting in the Russian Civil War, he became an officer and rose to command 50th Rifle Corps Armored and Mechanized forces during the Winter War. After the end of the war, Rodin became deputy commander of the 24th Tank Division and fought in the Baltic Operation and Leningrad Strategic Defensive. Given command of the 124th Tank Brigade in September 1941, he led the unit during battles around Leningrad and in the Lyuban Offensive Operation. From June 1942, Rodin commanded the 26th Tank Corps and led the unit during Operation Uranus. For its actions, the corps became the 1st Guards Tank Corps and Rodin received the title Hero of the Soviet Union. After Stalingrad, he was promoted to command the 2nd Tank Army and led it during Operation Kutuzov and the Battle of the Dnieper, but was dismissed due to lack of progress and heavy losses incurred in the army's advance. In September 1943, Rodin became commander of the Western Front (later 3rd Belorussian Front) Armored and Mechanized Forces, participating in Operation Suvorov, Operation Bagration and the East Prussian Offensive.

Born into a poor peasant family in the town of Maykov near Oryol, Russia, Rodin showed an early interest in art and began to study at the age of sixteen under his father. In 1864 he moved to Paris, where he studied at the Académie des Beaux-Arts under Antoine-Louis Barye and Louis-Léopold David. He returned to Russia in 1870 and soon gained acclaim for his work, which focused on monumental sculpture with a realistic approach. His first public commission was for a monument to Emperor Alexander II in Saint Petersburg.

Rodin's work was frequently criticized for its idealism and heavy handedness, but he remained one of the most popular and influential artists of his time. He had a significant impact on both French art and architecture, as well as on sculpture in general. Many of his works are found in public places around the world, such as The Gates of Hell on the Ismaili Imam Ali Mosque in Mumbai, India, The Thinker (1879) in Central Park in New York City, and The Kiss (1896) at The Louvre in Paris.

His entire career was spent imposing party discipline through the Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Though far less well known than successive chiefs of the Soviet police, such as Nikolai Yezhov or Lavrentiy Beria, he was arguably as steeply involved as either of them in the repression during the Stalin years. Unlike them, escaped arrest or public notoriety. Early career
Matvei Shkiryatov was the son of a peasant, born in a village called Vishnyakovo, in Tula Province. He joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906, and worked in the illegal party organisation in Moscow, Rostov-on-Don and Tula. He was arrested repeatedly, but avoided being deported to Siberia or held in prison for very long. There is no evidence that these arrests were for political activity. He was drafted into the imperial army in 1915. After the February Revolution, he was elected to the executive of the Moscow and Tula soviets. In 1918-20, he was secretary of the Moscow branch of the Garment Workers' Union.","(237, 11)","Matvei Fyodorovich Shkiryatov (Russian: Матвей Фёдорович Шкирятов; 18 October [O.S. 5 October] 1837 – 8 February [O.S. 15 February] 1881) was a Russian composer and pianist who is best remembered for his chamber music.

Matvei Shkiryatov was born in the town of Kremenchug, in what is now the Rostov Oblast of Russia, to a family of musicians. He showed early promise as a pianist, and studied with Nikolai Rubinstein in Moscow. In 1859, he won first prize at the Moscow Conservatory's competition for young composers.

Shkiryatov's earliest compositions were chamber pieces, but he soon began writing larger-scale works for orchestra. His first symphony, ""The Tempest"", was premiered in 1868 under the direction of Tchaikovsky. Shkiryatov's other symphonies include ""The Isle of the Dead"" (1871), ""The Maid of Orleans"" (1876), and ""The Invisible City"" (1881). Among his other orchestral works are the overtures ""The Stone Guest"" (1869), ""The Little Humpbacked Horse"" (1871), and ""Boris Godunov"" (1875).

The village is located on the eastern bank of the River Eden, opposite the village of Appleby-in-Westmorland. The Eden forms part of the border between England and Scotland.

The name Screeb is thought to derive from Old Norse ""skriða"" meaning 'to scrape'. The village has been mentioned in the Domesday Book as ""Scerib"", and was part of the manor of Appleby. In 1086 it was owned by Earl Tostig Godwinson.

The Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist dates from the 12th century, although alterations and additions were made in the 14th and 15th centuries. The roof was replaced in 1822 and further restoration work was carried out in 1892–94. The church contains a number of monuments, including one to Sir Thomas Lowther (died 1685), who served as Governor of Barbados and Jamaica, and another to Revd Richard Lowther (died 1740), who served as rector of Screeb from 1692 until his death.

Rye is a seaside town in Greater ","Rye is a seaside town in Greater Melbourne on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, Australia. It is approximately 95 km south of Melbourne's central business district. Rye's beach, on the eastern side of Port Phillip, is popular with swimmers, fishermen, yachtsmen, and kitesurfers. Its ocean beach (which is not patrolled) is also popular with surfers and divers. Its local government area is the Shire of Mornington Peninsula. Rye is in the traditional country of the Boon wurrung (Bunurong) people of the Kulin nation. History
Rye was proclaimed a town on 26 February 1861 and is partly in the parish of Wannaeue but mainly in the parish of Nepean, which is west of Government Road and Weeroona Street. The township went south to the southern boundary of the cemetery, with its east and west boundaries being Weir Street and Dundas Street. Suburban lots of 21 to 98 acres extended west to French St and south to a point just past the Golf Pde corner. Most of these suburban lots were bought by W.A.Blair, a Melbourne Lime Merchant.
He also received grants for much land in the parishes of Wannaeue and Nepean. His objective was to establish a monopoly, which was only rivalled by John Cain. Many who had been engaged in the production of lime, such as Nathan Page, Tom Bennett, Edward Russell, Harold Bainbridge and Spunner, were dispossessed of their kilns by Blair in about 1867. Lime could be quarried throughout the area west of Boneo Road. Many golf courses and the Peninsula Hot Springs are on the sites of Limeburners' properties between Browns and Limestone Roads. An excellent reproduction of a lime kiln can be seen on the foreshore just east of White Cliff. They were built into the side of a hill so that firewood and napped limestone could be loaded from above.","(344, 17)","Rye is a seaside town in Greater Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

A military officer, he came to power after a military coup in 1969. Establishing a one-party state, with his Sudanese Socialist Union as the sole legal political entity in the country, Nimeiry pursued socialist and Pan-Arabist policies and close collaboration with Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. In 1971 Nimeiry survived a pro-Soviet coup attempt, after which he forged an alliance with Mao Zedong of China (who provided him with significant military and economic assistance), and, eventually, with the United States as well. In 1972 he signed the Addis Ababa Agreement, ending the First Sudanese Civil War. In his last years in power he also adopted aspects of Islamism, and in 1983 he imposed Sharia law throughout the country, precipitating the Second Sudanese Civil War.

The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection was ","The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection was the first world-wide proclamation against the manufacturing and international trade in liquor and drugs as well as the prohibition of legalised vice. It served as a first major campaign to raise public awareness of the need for international agreements on controls for opium and its derivatives. Description of the petition
Addressed to all rulers and nations of the world, this petition to adopt prohibition was written by the American Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) president Frances Willard in 1884. It was carried across the world by at least four World WCTU missionaries who gathered signatures of nearly eight million people in more than fifty countries. The signatures can be categorized in three basic sections: signatures of individual women, written endorsements of men, and attestations of leaders of groups that had endorsed the petition. The signed petitions from the U.S. (over 750,000) were sent to Mrs. Rebecca C. Shuman in Evanston, Illinois who trimmed and mounted them on white muslin, one-half yard in width and bound with red ribbon on one side and blue ribbon on the other. Signed petitions from Great Britain (350,000 signatories) came in already mounted on cloth in time for presentation to the U.S. president in February 1885. The Polyglot Petition is archived in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union Administration Building in Evanston, Illinois, United States of America.","(252, 8)","The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection was a petition started in late 2017 by a coalition of individuals concerned about the rise of nationalism and xenophobia around the world.

The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection was started in late 2017 by a coalition of individuals concerned about the rise of nationalism and xenophobia around the world. The petition called for the protection of multilingualism and the promotion of linguistic diversity. The goal of the petition was to raise awareness about the importance of preserving and promoting multilingualism, and to call on governments to take action to protect languages and cultures from discrimination and violence.

The Polyglot Petition for Home Protection received a significant amount of support from around the world. The petition was signed by over 100,000 people from over 100 countries, including prominent figures such as Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison and actor George Clooney. The petition also received support from organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, which called on governments to take action to protect languages and cultures from discrimination and violence.

In response to the widespread support the Polyglot Petition for Home Protection has received, several governments have announced plans to take action to protect languages and cultures from discrimination and violence.

Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained ","Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained in the lands around the Black Sea, especially in Crimea. They were the least-impactful on the fate of Europe and the longest-lasting of the Gothic communities. Their existence is well attested through the ages though the exact period when they ceased to exist as a distinct culture is unknown; as with the Goths in general, they may have been diffused with the surrounding peoples. In the Fourth Turkish letter by Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, they are described as ""a warlike people, who to this day inhabit many villages"" though in the 5th century, Theodoric the Great failed to rouse Crimean Goths to support his war in Italy. At the time, it was customary to refer to a wide range of Germanic tribes as ""Goths"", so the exact ethnic origin of the Germanic peoples in Crimea is a subject of debate. Aside from textual reports of the existence of the Goths in Crimea, both first and second hand, from as early as 850, numerous archaeological examples also exist, including the ruins of the former capital city of the Crimean Goths: Doros, or Mangup as it is now known. On top of this, there are numerous articles of jewelry, weaponry, shields, buttons, pins, and small personal artifacts on display in museums in Crimea and in the British Museum which have led to a better understanding of the Gothic Kingdom.","(265, 7)","Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained in Crimea after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. They are thought to have assimilated with the locals, and their descendants are today known as Crimean Tatars.

The Greuthungi-Gothic tribes were a group of Germanic people who lived in what is now southern Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus in the 4th century AD. They were closely related to the Goths, who lived in present-day Germany and Denmark. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, the Greuthungi-Gothic tribes remained in Crimea, which was part of the Eastern Roman Empire.

The Crimean Goths were closely related to the Ostrogoths, who lived in present-day Italy and Spain. The Crimean Goths were also closely related to the Visigoths, who lived in present-day France and Portugal.

The Crimean Goths were initially defeated by the Byzantine Empire, but they later defeated the Byzantine Empire and became independent rulers. The Crimean Goths ruled Crimea for more than 400 years. The Crimean Goths were eventually conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1475 AD.","(195, 10)","Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained  in the Crimean Peninsula after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. The term ""Crimean Goths"" refers specifically to those Goths who settled in the Crimean region, as opposed to other Gothic tribes that migrated to other parts of Europe. The Crimean Goths played a significant role in the history of the Eastern Roman Empire, particularly during the reign of Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century. They were known for their military prowess and their ability to adapt to the local environment, which allowed them to maintain a distinct cultural identity despite being surrounded by other ethnic groups. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Crimean Goths developed a unique blend of Gothic and Byzantine cultural influences, which is reflected in their art, architecture, and material culture. Despite their importance in the region, little is known about the daily lives and social structures of the Crimean Gothes, and much of what is known about them comes from fragmented historical accounts and archaeological findings.

The viola da Terceira (also viola Terceirense) ","The  viola da Terceira (also viola Terceirense) is a stringed musical instrument of the guitar family, from the Portuguese islands of the archipelago of the Azores, associated with the island of Terceira. History
The viola and other string instruments were brought during the Portuguese maritime expansion to the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde, Brazil and other locales, becoming common in the populations. Due to its importance in Portuguese music it likely arrived in Angola, Goa and Macau, and as far as Hawaii by the 19th century, where it became the forerunner of the ukulele. These early cordophones, the violas, had characteristics identical to the modern instruments, and great importance along the Iberian Peninsula, where it appeared in iconography, poems and diverse literature. The chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso, who identified it as just a ""Viola"", suggested that it first arrived in the Azores in the second half of the 19th century, brought the first settlers. There is little documentation that dates the arrival of the Portuguese Violas de Arame in the islands of the Azores.","(199, 6)","The  viola da Terceira (also viola da gamba, viola da quarta or viola da quinta) is a bowed string instrument belonging to the violin family. It was formerly known as the viola da gamba de quarta corda, because the fourth string of the viola da gamba is tuned a fourth lower than the other strings. The name ""viola da Terceira"" was introduced in the 18th century. The viola da Terceira is commonly used in classical music, chamber music and as a solo instrument.

The viola da Terceira is generally tuned in fifths, GDAE (Guitar tuning). Unlike the violin, which has four strings in three courses (E, A, D), the viola da Terceira has five strings in four courses. The lowest string is G, the next D, then A, followed by E and finally G. This configuration gives it a brighter sound than the violin and enables it to be played more easily in higher positions on the keyboard.

The viola da Terceira was first constructed around 1550 by Antonio Stradivari and his sons Giuseppe and Antonio. It became one of Stradivari's most popular and renowned instruments, and many of his violas are still extant. The viola da Terceira was often used by composer Antonio Vivaldi and performers like Antonio Caldara and Giovanni Battista Viotti.","(245, 10)","The viola da Terceira (also viola Terceirense)  is a traditional stringed instrument originating from the island of Terceira, in the Azores archipelago, Portugal. It is a member of the viol family, closely related to the viola de gamba and the viola da braccio. Characterized by its flat back and fretted neck, this instrument has a rich history dating back to the 16th century, when it was introduced to the island by Portuguese settlers. Over time, the viola da terceira evolved to become an integral part of Terceira's cultural heritage, with its unique sound and playing style reflecting the island's distinct musical traditions. The instrument is typically played with a bow or by plucking the strings with the fingers, producing a wide range of tonal colors and dynamics. Despite its historical significance and cultural importance, the viola da terceira remains relatively unknown outside of the Azores, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote this traditional instrument, ensuring its continued relevance in modern times.

Cleanliness is both the abstract state of ","Cleanliness is both the abstract state of being clean and free from germs, dirt, trash, or waste, and the habit of achieving and maintaining that state. Cleanliness is often achieved through cleaning. Culturally, cleanliness is usually a good quality, as indicated by the aphorism: ""Cleanliness is next to Godliness"", and may be regarded as contributing to other ideals such as health and beauty. In emphasizing an ongoing procedure or set of habits for the purpose of maintenance and prevention, the concept of cleanliness differs from purity, which is a physical, moral, or ritual state of freedom from pollutants. Whereas purity is usually a quality of an individual or substance, cleanliness has a social dimension and direction or implies a system of interactions. ""Cleanliness,"" observed Jacob Burckhardt, ""is indispensable to our modern notion of social perfection."" A household or workplace may be said to exhibit cleanliness, but not ordinarily purity; cleanliness also would be a characteristic of the people who maintain cleanness or prevent dirtying.","(194, 7)","Cleanliness is both the abstract state of being clean, and the quality of being clean.

Cleanliness is an important factor in maintaining good health. It is necessary for preventing the spread of disease, and for maintaining a pleasant environment. Cleanliness can also be important for personal hygiene and appearance.

There are many ways to achieve cleanliness. Physical cleanliness can involve removal of dirt, dust, and other debris from one's environment. Chemical cleanliness can involve the use of disinfectants or sanitizers to clean surfaces or objects. Biological cleanliness refers to the prevention of the spread of disease by ensuring that objects and surfaces are free of germs.

Cleanliness is an important virtue in many religions and ethical traditions. Some believe that it is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Cleanliness is also an important part of many Eastern philosophies, such as Buddhism and Taoism.","(161, 11)","Cleanliness is both the abstract state of  being clean and free from dirt, grime, or other impurities, and the practice of maintaining this state.

Marcus Herennius Faustus was a Roman senator, ","Marcus Herennius Faustus was a Roman senator, who was active during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian. He was suffect consul in the nundinium of March of April 121 with Quintus Pomponius Marcellus as his colleague.  An inscription on the Colossi of Memnon at Luxor in Egypt refers to a Marcus Herennius M.f. Quir. Faustus Tiberius Julius Clemens Tadius Flaccus, who is likely the same person. Some authorities point to a line at the end of this inscription which has been read as Geta cos and assumed to refer to either Publius Septimius Geta, consul II in 203, or Geta, son of emperor Septimus Severus and consul in 205. If this identification is correct, this inscription would attest to an otherwise unknown consul who lived in the late second century/early third. On the other hand, Werner Eck has offered arguments against a later date, pointing out that the letters in question have also been read as IRISE [...] CETACO, as well as arguing that it would make better sense for this inscription to be carved during the emperor Hadrian's visit in 128.","(202, 8)","Marcus Herennius Faustus was a Roman senator, statesman and philosopher of the first century AD. He was a friend of Cicero and a critical commentator on the works of Plato. Faustus is chiefly known for his philosophical treatise De Divinatione, in which he defends the practice of divination from the charges of superstition.

Marcus Herennius Faustus was born around 100 BC in the town of Arpinum in Latium, one of Rome's most prestigious neighbourhoods. He came from a distinguished family, his father being a consul and his grandfather an equestrian magistrate. Faustus himself entered public life at an early age, serving as a quaestor in Macedonia and as a praetor in Cilicia. In 89 BC he was elected to the Roman Senate, where he performed distinguished service as an orator and advisor to successive Roman governors.

Faustus's greatest achievement came in the years leading up to 50 BC, when he served as praetor and governor of Cilicia. It was during this time that he became close friends with Cicero, with whom he shared a love of philosophy. Faustus is best known today for his philosophical treatise De Divinatione (On Divination), which he wrote in 54 BC in response to charges of superstition levelled against diviners by the Roman senator Gaius Valerius Flaccus.

Thanadelthur ""Thanadeltth'er"" (c. 1697 – 5 February ","Thanadelthur ""Thanadeltth'er"" (c. 1697 – 5 February 1717) was a woman of the Chipewyan Dënesųłı̨ne nation who served as a guide and interpreter for the Hudson's Bay Company. She was instrumental in forging a peace agreement between the Dënesųłı̨ne (Chipewyan) and the Cree people. She was trilingual, able to speak English, Chipewyan, and Cree. Life 
Thanadelthur is thought to have been born during 1697. In early 1713,  a party of Dënesųłı̨ne Chipewyans were attacked by Crees and their women were captured; among these was Thanadelthur. Women were sometimes the cause of tribal warfare, and were the prizes once the battle was over. Female slaves were valuable to the tribal workforce, and this added to the high female mortality rate among them as well. After spending the winter with their Cree captors, Thanadelthur and one other woman escaped and attempted to rejoin their people. Cold and hunger prevented them from doing so, however, and the two endured a year of hardship until Thanadelthur's travelling companion died. Five days later Thanadelthur was discovered by goose hunters from the Hudson's Bay Company. Her story was never self documented despite all of her dealings with the Hudson's Bay Company, and all of her legacy is contained to the journals from members of the HBC.","(242, 11)","Thanadelthur ""Thanadeltth'er"" (c. 1697 – 5 February 1768) was a German-born Swiss painter, draughtsman and etcher.

Thanadelthur was born in 1697 in the city of Mainz, Germany. He was the son of the painter Christian Thanadelthur. He moved to Switzerland in 1727, and settled in Interlaken. Thanadelthur died in Interlaken in 1768.

Thanadelthur is best known for his paintings of landscapes and historical scenes. His work is characterized by its precision and clarity of detail, and his use of light and color to create a sense of harmony and beauty. His paintings are often compared to the works of 17th-century Dutch painters such as Rembrandt and Johannes Vermeer.

Thanadelthur's work has been exhibited in museums around the world, including the Louvre, the National Gallery of Canada, and the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. He has also been awarded several prestigious awards, including the Grand Prix de Rome (1736) and the Royal Gold Medal from King Louis XV of France (1747).","(187, 10)","Thanadelthur ""Thanadeltth'er"" (c. 1697 – 5 February 1717) was a Chipewyan woman who played a significant role in the early history of the Hudson's Bay Company in North America. Born in the Athabasca region of what is now Alberta, Canada, Thanadelthur was a member of the Dëne Sųłiné (Chipewyan) First Nation. In 1715, she was taken captive by the Cree, a rival tribe, during a raid on her village. While in captivity, Thanadelthur learned the Cree language and culture, which would later prove invaluable in her interactions with European traders.

In 1716, Thanadelthur escaped from her captors and made her way to York Factory, a Hudson's Bay Company trading post on Hudson Bay. Her arrival at the post marked the beginning of a significant period in the company's history, as she served as an interpreter and guide for the company's traders. Thanadelthur's knowledge of both Chipewyan and Cree languages enabled her to facilitate trade and communication between the company and various Indigenous groups in the region. Her contributions to the company's success were substantial, and she became a key figure in the development of the fur trade in North America. Despite her importance, Thanadelthur's life was cut short when she died of smallpox in 1717, at the age of approximately 20. Her legacy, however, continues to be recognized and celebrated by historians and scholars today. ### | End of Response | ###

Overview
The Kitayatsu site is located is located on a plateau at an elevation of 145 meters that spreads out at the foot of the southeastern foot of Mount Haruna. In the year 2000, the ruins of a large fortified residence belonging to a gōzoku clan ruling the surrounding area during the Kofun period was discovered. The site was fortified by two ravines forming natural moats to the east and west and two artificial moats with a width of 30 meters and depth of three meters to protect the northern and southern sides. The moats contained masonry with a breccia substrate, and it appears that the north and west moats also served for water storage. It is estimated through analysis of the volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount Asama which had accumulated in the moats to date from the latter half of the 5th century AD, or the middle of the Kofun period.

In traffic flow theory, the Newell–Daganzo merge ","In traffic flow theory, the Newell–Daganzo merge model describes a simple procedure on how to determine the flows exiting two branch roadways and merging to flow through a single roadway. The model is simple in that it does not consider the actual merging process between vehicles as the two branch roadways come together. The only information required to calculate the flows leaving the two branch roadways are the capacities of the two branch roadways and the exiting capacity, the demands into the system, and a value describing how the two input flows interact. This latter input term is called the split priority, or merge ratio, and is defined as the proportion of the two input flows when both are operating in congested conditions. The history of the merge model has its origins in Gordon Newell's description of the merging process, but Daganzo's cell transmission model lays out a diagram for a highway merge, and describes the application of the theory.","(174, 5)","In traffic flow theory, the Newell–Daganzo merge model is a model for the merging of two or more traffic streams into one. The model was developed by John D. Newell and Kenneth D. Daganzo in their 1972 paper ""A Model for the Merging of Traffic Streams.""

The Newell–Daganzo merge model is a mathematical model that is used to understand the behavior of traffic streams that are merging into one. The model accounts for the interactions between the traffic streams, and it can be used to predict the behavior of the combined traffic stream.

The Newell–Daganzo merge model is based on the concept of flow separation. In theory, flow separation occurs when two or more traffic streams are able to remain separate from each other. However, in practice, flow separation is rarely achieved and is instead replaced by flow merging.

Flow merging occurs when two or more traffic streams are forced to merge together. This process can be difficult and can lead to congestion on the roads. The Newell–Daganzo merge model is designed to help us understand how flow merging affects the behavior of the combined traffic stream.

The Newell–Daganzo merge model relies on two basic principles: conflict and cooperation. Conflict refers to the interactions between the different traffic streams, while cooperation refers to the way that the different traffic streams interact with each other.

**Braess's Paradox**
=====================

**Definition**
---------------

Braess' paradox is a phenomenon in traffic flow theory where the addition of a new road or lane can actually increase travel times for all road users, rather than decreasing them as one might expect. This paradox is named after Dietrich Braess, who first described it in 1968.

**History**
------------

Dietrich Braess, a German mathematician, first introduced the concept of Braess' paradox in his 1968 paper ""Über ein Paradoxon aus der Verkehrsplanung"" (""On a Paradox of Traffic Planning""). Since then, the paradox has been extensively studied and applied in various fields, including transportation engineering, economics, and computer science.

**Explanation**
----------------

Braess’ paradox occurs when the addition of a capacity-reducing link (such as a new lane or road) to a traffic network leads to a decrease in the overall efficiency of the network. This happens because the increased capacity of the new link attracts more traffic, which in turn causes congestion on the other links in the network. As a result, the total travel time for all","(477, 22)","In traffic flow theory, the Newell–Daganzo merge (also known as the Newell-Daganzo model) is a mathematical model that describes the merging of two lanes of traffic into a single lane.
The model was developed in the 1960s by American traffic engineer Robert Newell and Israeli traffic engineer Moshe Daganzo. The model is named after Newell and Daganzo.[1]
The model is used to predict the flow of traffic at an intersection. It is based on the assumption that drivers will merge into the lane with the least amount of delay. The model can be used to determine the optimal number of lanes at an intersection, as well as the optimal spacing between the lanes.
The Newell Daganzo model is often used in traffic engineering to determine the number of lanes needed at an intersection and the spacing between them. It is also used to predict traffic flow at intersections with traffic signals. The model has been shown to be accurate in many cases, but it is not always the best model for predicting traffic flow.

Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα) was an Attic ","Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα)  was an Attic festival, celebrated principally at Eleusis, in honour of Demeter (Δήμητρα, η Αλωαίη), protector of the fruits of the earth, of Dionysus, god of the grape and of wine, and Poseidon (Ποσειδώνας ο Φυτάλμιος), god of the seashore vegetation. In Greek, the word hálōs (ἅλως) from which Haloa derives means “threshing-floor” or “garden.” While the general consensus is that it was a festival related to threshing—the process of loosening the edible part of cereal grain after harvest—some scholars disagree and argue that it was instead a gardening festival. Haloa focuses mainly on the “first fruits” of the harvest, partly as a grateful acknowledgement for the benefits the husbandmen received, partly as prayer that the next harvest would be plentiful. The festival was also called Thalysia or Syncomesteria. The festival 
Haloa took place every year, during the month Poseideon (Ποσειδέωνας), after the first harvest was over. The festival took place around the threshing floor (αλώνια) at the same time throughout Attica. All women were expected to attend this event, but men were almost always excluded. Men had a legal and moral expectation to pay for their wives’ expenses in these festivities.
The strange timing of the harvest festival—mid-winter—is significant as well. The Greeks regarded the festival as sacred to not only Demeter but also to Dionysus. With the inclusion of Dionysus in the festival worship, the date shifted towards the winter as “he possessed himself of the festivals of Demeter, took over her threshing-floor and compelled the anomaly of a winter threshing festival.” In many ways, the festival was just as connected, if not more so, with Dionysus than with Demeter. Thus, we see the power and influence of the incoming god and of the importance of wine to Greek cult activity. Practically, Greeks were able to coax out a harvest just early enough to revel with Dionysus.","(368, 13)","Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα)  was an ancient city in the middle of the Nile Delta in present-day Al Fayyum governorate, Egypt. It was one of the most important cultural and commercial centers of Lower Egypt during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods. 

The name Haloa derives from the ancient Egyptian word ""h(a)r-w-aa"" meaning ""white"". The site is located on the eastern bank of the River Nile, opposite to modern Cairo, and was originally settled during the Predynastic Period. The city was abandoned following a series of floods in the New Kingdom period, but was briefly occupied by the Roman Empire in the late 1st century AD. It was later abandoned for good after a series of fires in late antiquity. The ruins of Haloa are today located approximately 2 km south of the present-day city of Al Fayyum.

Haloa was an important cultural and commercial center during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods. The city was home to a number of significant ancient sites, including a temple dedicated to Pharaoh Menkaure, a necropolis dating back to Dynasties III and IV, and a large granary. The city also played an important role in the development of writing in ancient Egypt, as it was home to one of the earliest known scriptoria.","(238, 10)","Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα) was an Attic  festival celebrated in ancient Greece in honor of Dionysus, the god of wine, fertility, and theater.

The name ""Haloa"" is derived from the Greek word ""halos,"" meaning ""threshing floor,"" which refers to the location where the festivities took place.

The Haloa festival was typically held in the month of Anthesterion, which corresponds to late February or early March in the modern Gregorian calendar. During this time, the Athenians would gather at the threshing floors on the outskirts of the city, where they would engage in various rituals and ceremonies to honor Dionysus. The festival was characterized by music, dance, and theater performances, as well as the consumption of wine and other offerings to the god.

One of the primary purposes of the Haloa festival was to ensure the fertility of the land and the success of the upcoming agricultural season. The Athenians believed that Dionysus, as the god of fertility, had the power to grant them a bountiful harvest, and they would offer sacrifices and prayers to him in the hopes of securing his favor. The festival also served as a time for socializing and community building, as the citizens of Athens would come together to celebrate and share in the joy of the occasion.

The force moved from Great Scotland Yard in 1890, to a newly completed building on the Victoria Embankment, and the name ""New Scotland Yard"" was adopted for the new headquarters. An adjacent building was completed in 1906. A third building was added in 1940. In 1967, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) moved its headquarters from the three-building complex to a tall, newly constructed building on Broadway in Victoria. In summer 2013, it was announced that the force would move to the Curtis Green Building – which is the third building of New Scotland Yard's previous site (1890–1967) – and that the headquarters would be renamed Scotland Yard. In November 2016, MPS moved to its new headquarters, which continues to bear the name of ""New Scotland Yard"".","(266, 10)","Scotland Yard (officially New Scotland Yard) is a central police station in London, England. The main building, located on the Strand at the eastern end of Trafalgar Square, is a Grade I listed building and the largest police station in the United Kingdom. It has a capacity of 1,000 officers and is responsible for policing the City of London and Westminster.

The first Scotland Yard was established in 1855 on a site east of what is now Whitehall near the present-day Charing Cross railway station. The force had its first headquarters there in a converted house and occupied other buildings until 1885. In that year, it moved to its present site. 

The original Scotland Yard building was destroyed by a German bomb during the Second World War and was replaced by the present structure, which opened in 1963. The first female officer to join the Metropolitan Police was Constance Beaumont in 1978.

 a lowland in the extreme southeast bootheel region of Missouri, part of the Atlantic Plain known as the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (areas 3e) or the Mississippi embayment
 the Missouri portion of the Ozark Plateau (areas 14a and 14b) which lies between the Mississippi Alluvial Plain and the Central lowland.

Walter Coffin (1784 – 15 February 1867) ","Walter Coffin (1784 – 15 February 1867) was a Welsh coalowner and Member of Parliament. Coffin is recognised as the first person to exploit the rich coal fields of the Rhondda Valley on an industrial scale, becoming one of the wealthiest coal mine owners in the world. Early life
Born in 1784 he was the second son of Walter Coffin, the founder of a tanning business in Bridgend, and his second wife Anne Morgan. Coffin was descended from a well known Bridgend family, the Prices of Ty'n Ton, into which his grandfather, an owner of an estate in Selworthy, had married. Coffin was educated at Cowbridge Grammar School and later at a nonconformist academy in Exeter; in 1804 he returned to Wales to join the family business.

Professional Identification is a type of social ","Professional Identification is a type of social identification and is the sense of oneness individuals have with a profession (e.g. law, medicine) and the degree to which individuals define themselves as profession members. Professional identity consists of the individual's alignment of roles, responsibilities, values, and ethical standards to be consistent with practices accepted by their specific profession. Sources of professional identification 
Researchers have found that a desire for quality (rather than profits) is associated with professional identification.  Organizations tend to be concerned with efficiency and profitability, whereas professions care mainly about providing the highest-quality service (as defined by the professions), almost regardless of cost or revenue considerations (Freidson, 2001). Administrators are usually seen as promoting profitability at the expense of profession-defined quality (Freidson, 2001). In one notable study, practicing physicians viewed administrators with medical degrees (e.g., the M.D.) as “outsiders” to the medical profession because of what the physicians believed to be the administrators’ undue emphasis on organizational goals (Hoff, 1999: 336). Practicing physicians viewed administrators with MDs more negatively than those without MDs because the former were thought to have “betrayed” the medical profession by assuming administrative roles (Hoff, 1999: 344).","(237, 9)","Professional Identification is a type of social identification which allows individuals to be recognized as professionals in their field of work. It can take various forms, such as professional certificates, licenses, or membership in professional organizations.

Professional Identification can be divided into two broad categories: formal and informal. Formal professional identification typically takes the form of a credential, such as a degree, certificate, license, or membership in a professional organization. In contrast, informal professional identification is based on reputation and personal credibility. Examples of informal forms of professional identification include being known for excellence in one's field, having an outstanding record of achievements, or being well-respected by one's peers.

 Professional Identification can be important for several reasons. First, it can help individuals to be recognized as experts in their field. Second, it can help to ensure that individuals are performing their jobs properly and following safety guidelines. Third, it can help to ensure that individuals are paid fairly for their work. Finally, it can help to protect individuals from being taken advantage of by dishonest employers or clients.","(206, 11)","Professional Identification is a type of social  identity that refers to an individual's perception of themselves as a member of a particular profession or occupation. It encompasses the values, norms, and expectations associated with a specific profession, which shape an individual's behavior, attitudes, and self-concept. Professional identification is a complex and multifaceted concept that is influenced by various factors, including education, training, work experience, and social interactions.

In many cases, professional identification is closely tied to an individual's sense of purpose and meaning, as well as their feelings of belonging and identity. For instance, a doctor may identify as a healer, a teacher as an educator, or an engineer as a problem-solver. This identification can have a significant impact on an individual's motivation, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. Research has shown that strong professional identification is associated with higher levels of job engagement, commitment, and performance.

However, professional identification can also be influenced by external factors, such as societal expectations, organizational culture, and power dynamics. For example, individuals from underrepresented groups may face challenges in developing a strong professional identity due to biases and stereotypes. Understanding professional identification is essential for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, as well as for fostering a positive and productive work environment. By examining the complexities of professional identification, researchers and practitioners can develop strategies to support individuals in developing a strong and authentic sense of self within their profession. ### | End of Response | ###

It encompasses the values, norms, and expectations associated with a specific profession, which shape an individual's behavior, attitudes, and self-concept. Professional identification is a complex and multifaceted concept that is influenced by various factors, including education, training, work experience, and social interactions.

In many cases, professional identification is closely tied to an individual's sense of purpose and meaning, as well as their feelings of belonging and identity. For instance, a doctor may identify as a healer, a teacher as an educator, or an engineer as a problem-solver. This identification can have a significant impact on an individual's motivation, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. Research has shown that strong professional identification is associated with higher levels of job engagement, commitment, and performance.

However, professional identification can also be influenced by external factors, such as societal expectations, organizational culture, and power dynamics. For example, individuals from underrepresented groups may face challenges in developing a strong professional identity due to biases and stereotypes. Understanding professional identification is essential for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, as well as for fostering a positive and productive work environment. By examining the complexities of professional identification, researchers and practitioners can develop strategies to support individuals in developing a strong and authentic sense of self within their profession.

Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely ","Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used management protocol in telecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is widely used to manage optical (SONET) and broadband access infrastructure in North America. TL1 is used in the input and output messages that pass between Operations Support Systems (OSSs) and Network Elements (NEs). Operations domains such as surveillance, memory administration, and access and testing define and use TL1 messages to accomplish specific functions between the OS and the NE. TL1 is defined in Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore) Generic Requirements document GR-831-CORE. History 
TL1 was developed by Bellcore in 1984 as a standard man-machine language to manage network elements for the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). It is based on Z.300 series man machine language standards. TL1 was designed as a standard protocol readable by machines as well as humans to replace the diverse ASCII based protocols used by different Network Element (NE) vendors. It is extensible to incorporate vendor specific commands.","(189, 9)","Transaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used computer language for transactions, chiefly in the banking and financial services sectors.

TL1 is a programming language designed for use in transactions. It is an industry standard, used in a wide variety of applications and systems, including automated teller machines (ATMs), point-of-sale systems, and securities exchanges. Transactions are generally defined as the execution of an operation or set of operations on data. In banking and financial services, transactions are used to carry out day-to-day business activities such as processing payments, authorizing loans, and issuing securities.

TL1 was designed in the early 1970s by a team of programmers at American Express. TL1 was originally developed for the Amex Data Processing System (ADPS), which was one of the first large-scale transaction processing systems. ADPS was subsequently acquired by WorldCom in 1998. WorldCom continued to develop TL1 until 2003, when it was acquired by PayPal. PayPal continues to develop TL1 as part of its PayPal Transact language product line.

Supported employment refers to service provisions wherein ","Supported employment refers to service provisions wherein people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, mental health, and traumatic brain injury, among others, are assisted with obtaining and maintaining employment. Supported employment is considered to be one form of employment in which wages are expected, together with benefits from an employer in a competitive workplace, though some versions refer to disability agency paid employment. Companies such as Skilcraft in the United States are an example of ""supported employment"" which is defined in law for state and federal reimbursements (by person not by agency or corporation). Community foundations of supported employment
Supported employment was developed in the United States in the 1970s as part of both vocational rehabilitation (VR) services (e.g., NYS Office of Vocational Services, 1978) and the advocacy for long term services and supports (LTSS) for individuals with significant disabilities in competitive job placements in integrated settings (e.g., businesses, offices, manufacturing facilities). Since the mid-1980s, supported employment in the professional literature primarily has referred to the ""individual placement"" model, either with job coaches or through ""natural supports"" models. The critical issue in supported employment (SE) was viewed as the need for funding for long-term services and supports (LTSS) in the community often termed beyond ""case closure"" (Griffin, Test, Dalton, & Wood, 1995). Supported employment is worldwide in 2013, though moving to new inclusive models, and the term has been used for assisting workers of diverse kinds who may need an extra jump start in the workplace; it is still associated with its roots in disability which includes community integration and deinstitutionalization","(311, 7)","Supported employment refers to service provisions wherein individuals who are unable to work due to a disability are given assistance in order to maintain their economic stability. In many cases, this assistance takes the form of financial support, but it may also take the form of help with finding a job or training.

Supported employment is a key component of many social welfare systems around the world, and it has been shown to be an effective way to help people remain economically stable. The benefits of supported employment include reduced reliance on government assistance, increased independence, and improved self-esteem.

There are a number of different types of supported employment programs, and they vary in terms of the level of assistance they provide. Some programs provide only financial support, while others provide assistance with finding a job or training. Programs typically vary in length from short-term (e.g., six months) to long-term (e.g., several years).

This approach contrasts with traditional sheltered workshops, where individuals with disabilities are often segregated from the general workforce. The primary goal of supported employment is to enable individuals with disabilities to secure and maintain competitive employment in the open labor market, thereby promoting independence, self-esteem, and economic self-sufficiency.

The concept of supported employment has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s, when advocates for disability rights began pushing for greater inclusion of individuals with disabilities in the workforce. In the United States, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 provided significant legislative backing for supported employment initiatives. These laws prohibited discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment and mandated that employers provide reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to job opportunities.

Supported employment programs typically involve a team of professionals, including job coaches, employment specialists, and vocational rehabilitation counselors, who work closely with individuals with disabilities to identify suitable job placements and provide ongoing support. Job coaches may assist with tasks such as resume development, interview preparation, and on-the-job training, while employment specialists help individuals navigate the job search process and connect them with potential employers. Vocational rehabilitation counselors may provide additional support, such as counseling and benefits planning, to help individuals with disabilities achieve their employment goals.

Research has consistently shown that supported employment can lead to improved employment outcomes, increased earnings, and enhanced quality of life for individuals with disabilities. Studies have also highlighted the benefits of supported employment for employers, including increased productivity, reduced turnover rates, and enhanced diversity and inclusion in the workplace. As a result, supported employment has become an increasingly popular approach to disability employment services, with many countries around the world adopting and adapting this model to meet the unique needs of their populations. ### | End of Response | ###

The primary goal of supported employment is to enable individuals with disabilities to secure and maintain competitive employment in the open labor market, thereby promoting independence, self-esteem, and economic self-sufficiency.

The concept of supported employment has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s, when advocates for disability rights began pushing for greater inclusion of individuals with disabilities in the workforce. In the United States, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 provided significant legislative backing for supported employment initiatives. These laws prohibited discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment and mandated that employers provide reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to job opportunities.

Supported employment programs typically involve a team of professionals, including job coaches, employment specialists, and vocational rehabilitation counselors, who work closely with individuals with disabilities to identify suitable job placements and provide ongoing support. Job coaches may assist with tasks such as resume development, interview preparation, and on-the-job training, while employment specialists help individuals navigate the job search process and connect them with potential employers. Vocational rehabilitation counselors may provide additional support, such as counseling and benefits planning, to help individuals with disabilities achieve their employment goals.

Research has consistently shown that supported employment can lead to improved employment outcomes, increased earnings, and enhanced quality of life for individuals with disabilities. Studies have also highlighted the benefits of supported employment for employers, including increased productivity, reduced turnover rates, and enhanced diversity and inclusion in the workplace. As a result, supported employment has become an increasingly popular approach to disability employment services, with many countries around the world adopting and adapting this model to meet the unique needs of their populations.

Moses Roper ( – April 15, 1891) ","Moses Roper ( – April 15, 1891) was an African American abolitionist, author and orator. He wrote an influential narrative of his enslavement in the United States in his Narrative of the Adventures and Escape of Moses Roper from American Slavery and gave thousands of lectures in Great Britain and Ireland to inform the European public about the brutality of American slavery. Early life 
Roper was born around 1815 in Caswell County, North Carolina. He was born to a Southern planter, Henry Roper, who was also his enslaver; his mother, Nancy, was of African American and indigenous descent who was enslaved by Henry Roper. When his wife discovered that Henry had raped Nancy, she attempted to murder Nancy but was prevented from doing so by Nancy's mother. When Moses was seven years old, he was separated from his mother and both were not reunited for several years.  Roper was enslaved by several men in North Carolina and Florida, where after several attempts he successfully managed to escape enslavement. Roper later said he had tried to escape between 16 and 20 times and after each failed attempt, was tortured and abused at the hands of his enslaver. In his slave narrative, he described his method of escaping recapture in Georgia: he encountered a group of farmers who wrote a free pass for him:","(247, 9)","Moses Roper ( – April 15, 1891) was an American historian and civil rights activist.

The Order of Monfragüe was a Spanish ","The Order of Monfragüe  was a Spanish military order founded at the castle of Monfragüe near Plasencia on the Tagus in 1196. The order was founded by the knights of the Order of Mountjoy who dissented from a merger with the Knights Templar. The order never prospered and on 23 May 1221, by order of Ferdinand III of Castile, it was merged into the Order of Calatrava. Formation
In the twelfth century Monfragüe was the centre of a Mountjoy commandary before it became the headquarters of its own order. The earliest reference to the commandary is in an economic transaction involving the commander, Gonzalo Padilla, and his fellow brothers (freyes, freires) of the Order. As early as 1186 the Order had tried to amalgamate with the Templars but failed. The remaining decade of its existence was spent in a state of utter collapse. The Order was united in December 1187 with the Hospital of the Holy Redeemer, but already a distinction had appeared in its ranks between the master of the order, Fralmo, and his followers on one hand and the commander of the Order in the Kingdom of Castile, Rodrigo González, and his support. By mid-1188 there was a schism in the Order, though it does not appear to have broken down along the lines Castile and León on one hand and the Crown of Aragon on the other, as sometimes supposed. When the final split occurred in 1196, over the successful amalgamation with the Templars, all opponents of the merger would have had to leave the lands of Alfonso II of Aragon, a strong supporter of the Temple.","(297, 10)","The Order of Monfragüe  was a military and civil order of Spain.

The military order consisted of four grades, while the civil order consisted of six grades. The insignia for both orders was a red cross pattee on a white field. The orders also had a motto: ""Nemo me impune lacessit"" (Nobody harms me without punishment).

Its name is derived from the Monfragüe Castle, a strategic fortress located in the province of Cáceres, Extremadura, which served as the order's headquarters.

At its peak, the Order of Monfrague consisted of a large number of knights, men-at-arms, and support personnel, who were drawn from the nobility and commoners alike. Members of the order were required to take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, and were expected to adhere to a strict code of conduct.

Owen Aldis (1926–2001) was a behavioural psychologist. ","Owen Aldis (1926–2001) was a behavioural psychologist. He was born into a notable Chicago family. His father was one of the trustees of the University of Chicago and ran a real estate management firm, his mother a writer of children's poetry and his maternal grandfather on the editor of the Chicago Tribune.  Aldis taught economics at Yale University and worked in investment in New York. But in the 1950s he moved west to San Francisco's Bay Area and began to develop his academic interest in behavioral psychology. He is most noted for his well received 1971 publication Play Fighting which is an ethological classic examining play in humans and animals. The study was based on extensive observational studies: 1,500 hours of field observation on humans, 700 hours of observations on animals at four California zoos and more than twenty hours of filmed playing humans and various animals. He was a member of the International Society for Human Ethology.","(173, 8)","Owen Aldis (1926–2001) was a behavioural psychologist. He is chiefly known for his work on reinforcement learning, for which he was awarded the prestigious John von Neumann Medal in 1990.

Aldis was born in 1926 in London, England. He received his B.Sc. from the University of London in 1948 and his M.Sc. from the University of Cambridge in 1950. Aldis worked as a research assistant at the University of Cambridge from 1950 to 1952, and then moved to the United States to work as a research associate at the Rand Corporation from 1952 to 1955. Aldis returned to England, and became a lecturer at the University of Cambridge from 1955 to 1958. He moved to the United States again, this time to become a professor at Yale University in 1958. Aldis remained at Yale until his retirement in 2001.

Aldis's work primarily focused on reinforcement learning, which is a field of study that deals with the behaviour of agents who learn by trial and error.

Operant Conditioning
Operant conditioning is a type of learning process in which behavior is modified based on its consequences. This concept was first introduced by American psychologist B.F. Skinner in the 1930s and has since become a fundamental theory in the field of psychology.

Skinner's work on operant conditioning was influenced by the earlier work of Edward Thorndike, who proposed the law of effect, which states that behaviors followed by a satisfying consequence will be strengthened, while behaviors followed by an unsatisfying consequence will be weakened. Skinner expanded on Thorndike's ideas and developed the concept of operant conditioning as we know it today.

The Wealden hall house is a type ","The Wealden hall house is a type of vernacular medieval timber-framed hall house traditional in the south east of England. Typically built for a yeoman, it is most common in Kent (hence ""Wealden"" for the once densely forested  Weald) and the east of Sussex but has also been built elsewhere.  Kent has one of the highest concentrations of such surviving medieval timber-framed buildings in Europe. The original floor plan usually had four bays with the two central ones forming the main hall open to the roof with the hearth in the middle and two doors to the outside at one end forming a cross passage. The open hearth was later moved towards the cross passage and became a fireplace with chimney, sometimes the chimney pile even blocking the cross passage, which had soon been screened off the main hall. Beyond the cross passage the outer bay at the ""screens end"" or ""lower end"" of the hall, usually contained two rooms commonly called buttery and pantry, while the rooms in the bay at the other end, the ""upper end"", were called parlours. The end bays each had an upper floor containing solars, which did not communicate with each other, as the hall rose to the rafters between them. The upper stories on both ends typically extended beyond the lower outer wall being jettied on at least one side of the building. As the main hall had no upper floor the outer wall ran straight up without jettying, and thus the central bays appeared recessed. 
The early buildings had  thatched roofs and walls of wattle and daub often whitewashed. Later buildings would have a brick infilling between timbers, sometimes leading to a complete replacement of the outer walls of the basement with solid stone walls.","(325, 11)","The Wealden hall house is a type of historic house built in the 17th and 18th centuries in England.

Ballet as a music form progressed from ","Ballet as a music form progressed from simply a complement to dance, to a concrete compositional form that often had as much value as the dance that went along with it. The dance form, originating in France during the 17th century, began as a theatrical dance. It was not until the 19th century that ballet gained status as a “classical” form. In ballet, the terms ‘classical’ and ‘romantic’ are chronologically reversed from musical usage. Thus, the 19th century Classical period in ballet coincided with the 19th century Romantic era in music. Ballet music composers from the 17th–20th centuries, including the likes of Jean-Baptiste Lully, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Igor Stravinsky, and Sergei Prokofiev, were predominantly in France and Russia. Yet with the increased international notoriety seen in Tchaikovsky's and Stravinsky's lifetime, ballet music composition and ballet in general spread across the western world. History
Until about the second half of the 19th century, the role of music in ballet was secondary, with the main emphasis on dance, while music was simply a compilation of danceable tunes. Writing ""ballet music"" used to be a job for musical craftsmen, rather than for masters. For example, critics of the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–1893) mentioned his writing of ballet music as something demeaning.","(248, 10)","Ballet as a music form progressed from its origins in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century to become one of the most prominent and renowned art forms in the world. While ballet initially served as an accompaniment to song, it developed into its own distinct genre, characterized by its choreography, music and dramatic elements.

In the early days of ballet, courtly performances were accompanied by music played on pipe organs or harpsichords. As courtly dances grew more elaborate and intricate, however, their accompanying music became too difficult for courtiers to play. This led to the development of an entirely new form of ballet music, known as chamber ballet. Chamber ballet was typically performed by a small group of dancers accompanied only by string instruments such as violins or cellos.

As ballet grew in popularity and complexity, it began to be performed in larger venues with a wider range of accompanying musicians. This led to the creation of opera ballets, which featured lavish sets and costumes and extended dance scenes that could take up entire performances. Opera ballets were typically performed by large castes of actors and dancers who wore elaborate costumes and makeup.

Today, ballet is one of the most popular forms of art in the world. It is widely enjoyed by people of all ages, and is often used as an educational tool in schools. Ballet is also a major component of many professional musical theatre productions.","(263, 12)","Ballet as a music form progressed from 15th-century courtly entertainment in Italy to a highly technical and expressive art form in the 19th and 20th centuries. At its core, ballet music refers to the orchestral accompaniment used in classical ballet performances. Characterized by its dramatic and emotive qualities, ballet music serves as a vital component in conveying the narrative and emotional depth of a ballet. Composers such as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Sergei Prokofiev, and Igor Stravinsky have made significant contributions to the development of ballet music, creating iconic scores for renowned ballets like Swan Lake, Romeo and Juliet, and The Rite of Spring. Ballet music often employs a range of orchestral instruments, including strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion, to create a rich and dynamic sound. The use of leitmotifs, a recurring musical theme associated with a particular character or idea, is also a distinctive feature of ballet music. In addition to its role in ballet performances, ballet music has also been used in other contexts, such as film scores and concert performances.

The McLaren M6A was a race car ","The McLaren M6A was a race car developed by driver Bruce McLaren and his Bruce McLaren Motor Racing team for their entry in 1967 Can-Am season.  As a replacement for the team's M1Bs from 1966, the Chevrolet-powered M6A's improved design earned Bruce McLaren and his team their first of multiple Can-Am championships.  After the M6As were replaced by the M8A in preparation for 1968, McLaren and technical partner Trojan–Tauranac Racing developed the M6B which was sold to customers for use in Can-Am as well as other racing series. The M6 name was later used in the development of a closed-cockpit sports car for the 24 Hours of Le Mans and known as the M6GT.  The company's plan to homologate it for the FIA's Group 4 regulations was, however, never completed, and only a few M6GT prototypes were finished by McLaren and Trojan.  Two M6GTs were later converted to road cars, one of which became Bruce McLaren's personal transport.","(175, 6)","The McLaren M6A was a race car designed by McLaren for Formula One racing. The car was introduced at the 1995 Australian Grand Prix and raced for three seasons.

The McLaren M6A was designed by McLaren to replace the outgoing McLaren M5A. The M5A had been a successful Formula One car, but it was aging and lacked competitiveness against newer cars from Ferrari and Williams. The M6A was designed to address these issues, and it proved to be a successful car.

The M6A was a radical departure from the M5A. It featured a radically new carbon-fiber monocoque chassis, which made it much lighter and more responsive than the older car. The M6A also had a much more powerful engine, which allowed it to compete with the newer cars from Ferrari and Williams.

The M6A only competed in three seasons in Formula One, but it proved to be a successful car. It finished fifth in the 1995 Australian Grand Prix, fourth in the 1996 Canadian Grand Prix, and third in the 1997 French Grand Prix. These results were enough to secure a third place in the Constructors' Championship for McLaren at the 1997 season finale in France.","(215, 11)","The McLaren M6A was a race car  designed and built by the British Formula One constructor McLaren in 1967.

He was born and died at Watchet, Somerset. Pearse was a middle-order right-handed batsman whose club cricket was for Watchet Cricket Club, where Harold Gimblett was his contemporary. As a 16-year-old, playing for Watchet against Wellington Cricket Club, he joined Gimblett with the Watchet score at 37 for seven chasing a total of 160. The pair added the 123 runs needed, Gimblett scoring 91 and Pearse 33. Pearse followed Gimblett into the Somerset side, making his debut in 1936 at the Agricultural Showgrounds, Frome, the same ground where Gimblett had made his sensational debut a year earlier. In his first innings he scored 20, which was the second highest of the Somerset innings against Kent. But in five other first-class matches in the 1936 season he failed to score more than 10 in any innings, and in two matches in 1937 he also made little impression.

In 1921, Allan founded the journal ""Fianna Éireann"", which he edited until 1923. That year he also wrote and directed his first play, ""The Plough and the Stars"". The play was not well received by audiences or critics, but it has since been seen as a significant work in Irish theatre. In 1924, he married Mary Clarke.

Pearse's poetry is characterised by its dense language and its romanticism of Irish nationalism. His best-known work is the short poem ""Easter 1916"", which commemorates the Easter Rising that took place two years earlier.

Allan Fulton Worthington (born February 5, 1929), ","Allan Fulton Worthington (born February 5, 1929), nicknamed ""Red"", is a former professional baseball pitcher. He played all or part of 14 seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York / San Francisco Giants (1953–54, 1956–59), Boston Red Sox (1960), Chicago White Sox (1960), Cincinnati Reds (1963–64) and Minnesota Twins (1965–69). Worthington batted and threw right-handed. Raised in Birmingham, Alabama, Worthington played baseball at the University of Alabama before becoming a professional. Acquired by the Giants in 1953, he began his career with the ballclub as a starter, pitching two shutouts in his first two major league games. After spending most of 1954 and all of 1955 in the minor leagues, he became a full-time starter again in 1956. During 1957–58, he split his time between the rotation and the bullpen, and by 1959 he was almost exclusively used as a relief pitcher. He split 1960 between the Red Sox, the minor leagues, and the White Sox, retiring with about a month left in the season because the White Sox were engaged in ruses to steal opposing team's signs, and he could not play for the team with a clear conscience. He completed his degree at Howard College, then decided to return to baseball and spent two years in the minor leagues for the White Sox. The Reds acquired him in 1963, and Worthington posted a 2.99 earned run average (ERA) out of the bullpen for them that year. He began 1964 with Cincinnati, was sent to the minor leagues, and had his contract purchased by the Twins, whom he would spend the rest of his career with. Sports Illustrated called his 1.37 ERA with the team that year ""impressive."" In 1965, Worthington had a career-high 21 saves and a career-low 2.13 ERA, also winning 10 games. From 1966 to 1967 he saved 32 games, and in 1968 he led American League (AL) relievers with 18 saves. In a 14-year career, Worthington compiled a 75–82 record with 834 strikeouts, a 3.39 ERA, and 110 saves in  innings pitched.","(404, 15)","Allan Fulton Worthington (born February 5, 1929), is an American businessman, investor, and philanthropist who founded Worthington Industries, one of the largest privately held corporations in the United States.

Norwood Russell Hanson (August 17, 1924 – ","Norwood Russell Hanson (August 17, 1924 – April 18, 1967) was an American philosopher of science. Hanson was a pioneer in advancing the argument that observation is theory-laden — that observation language and theory language are deeply interwoven — and that historical and contemporary comprehension are similarly deeply interwoven. His single most central intellectual concern was the comprehension and development of a logic of discovery. Work
Hanson's best-known work is Patterns of Discovery (1958), in which he argues that what we see and perceive is not what our senses receive, but is instead filtered sensory information, where the filter is our existing preconceptions – a concept later called a 'thematic framework.' He cited optical illusions such as the famous old Parisienne woman (Patterns of Discovery, p. 11), which can be seen in different ways. Hanson drew a distinction between 'seeing as' and 'seeing that' which became a key idea in evolving theories of perception and meaning. He wanted to formulate a logic explaining how scientific discoveries take place. He used Charles Sanders Peirce's notion of abduction for this.","(204, 8)","Norwood Russell Hanson (August 17, 1924 – September 5, 2003) was an American philosopher. He is known for his work in meta-ethics and moral philosophy, as well as for his contributions to logical theory and the philosophy of language. He also wrote extensively on religion and Christian theology.

Hanson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on August 17, 1924. He received his B.A. from Calvin College in 1946 and his M.A. from the University of Minnesota in 1948. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1952.

Hanson taught at the University of California, Berkeley from 1952 to 1958, at Yale University from 1958 to 1968, and at Princeton University from 1968 to 2002. He was a visiting professor at the University of Cambridge (1972), the University of Munich (1976), and the University of Geneva (1985).

He died on September 5, 2003, in Princeton, New Jersey.

Hanson wrote extensively on a variety of topics in meta-ethics, moral philosophy, logical theory, and the philosophy of language. His seminal book is The Foundations of Metaphysics (1958), in which he develops a systematic treatment of metaphysical problems from a Neo-Kantian perspective. His other major works include: Ethics (1969), Thereneutics (1975), Meta-Ethics (1979), Logic: A New Introduction (1990), Truth: A New Conception (1991), The Concept of God (1993), The Reasoning Animal","(280, 14)","Norwood Russell Hanson (August 17, 1924 – 1967) was an American philosopher who made significant contributions to the fields of epistemology and the philosophy of science.

### | Analysis | ###
### Main Arguments: ###
The text presents the following main arguments about Hanson's contributions:

1. **Challenge to scientific objectivity**: Hanson's work in ""Patterns of Discovery"" questioned traditional notions of objective scientific inquiry, suggesting that all observations are influenced by pre-existing theoretical frameworks.

### Significance of Theory-Ladenness: ###
Hanson's concept of theory-laddenness is significant because it:

Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898–1986) was an acoustical ","Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898–1986) was an acoustical physicist, who in 1940 while a professor at the University of Michigan invented the first practical ultrasonic testing method and apparatus. He was granted US Patent 2,280,226 for the invention in 1942. Manufactured by Sperry Corporation, the testing device was known variously as the Firestone-Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope and sometimes also just as a Supersonic Reflectoscope, the name Firestone had originally coined for the instrument. The technology is not just used in quality control in factories to reject defective parts before shipment, but also revolutionized transportation safety. For example, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintenance inspection of railroad cars, particularly axles and wheels, aircraft, particularly fuselages, and other transportation vessels for material fatigue. Dr. Firestone’s ultrasonic pulse echo technique for metal defect testing was also later applied in medical diagnosis, giving birth to the field of Echocardiography and to the field of Medical Ultrasonography, generally. Dr. Firestone was the editor of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America from 1939-1957. Among Firestone’s many other inventions in his field are in a single year an “automatic device for the minute inspection of flaws”, “a new and useful improvement in hook-up of electrical apparatus”, and “[a] device for measuring noise”, and, even, later a “musical typewriter”. In 1933, Firestone proposed an alternative to the mechanical–electrical analogy of James Clerk Maxwell in which force is made the analogy of voltage (the impedance analogy).  Firestone's analogy (now called the mobility analogy) makes force the analogy of current.  In this work he introduced the concept of ""through"" and ""across"" variables and demonstrated that there were analogies for these variables in other energy domains, making it possible to treat a complex system as a unified whole in analysis.  Firestone's analogy became popular amongst mechanical filter designers because it has the property of preserving network topologies when transforming between the mechanical and electrical domains.","(379, 12)","Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898–1986) was an acoustical engineer and inventor who developed the first practical synthetic rubber. He is also credited with the invention of the Firestone tire, which revolutionized automotive transportation.

Monitor proofing or soft-proofing is a step ","Monitor proofing or soft-proofing is a step in the prepress printing process. It uses specialized computer software and hardware to check the accuracy of text and images used for printed products. Monitor proofing differs from conventional forms of “hard-copy” or ink-on-paper color proofing in its use of a calibrated display(s) as the output device. Monitor proofing systems rely on calibration, profiling and color management to produce an accurate representation of how images will look when printed. 
While a “soft-proof” function has existed in desktop publishing applications for some time, commercial monitor proofing extends this capability to multiple users and multiple locations by specifying the hardware to be used, and by enforcing one set of calibration procedures and color management policies for all users of the system. This ensures that all viewers are calibrated to a known set of conditions, and given hardware of equal capabilities will therefore be viewing the same color on screen.","(171, 6)","Monitor proofing or soft-proofing is a step in the editorial process of producing a digital publication where one checks the look, feel, and content of a document before it is published online.

Soft monitor proofing refers to the use of software to check the document against user feedback. This feedback can come from a survey, an anonymous user rating system, or comments from fellow editors.

There are several reasons for conducting monitor proofing. One reason is to make sure that all the content in a document is accurate. Another reason is to make sure that all of the formatting is correct. Finally, monitor proofing can be used to check for typos and other errors.

At the beginning of the Depression, he was asked by J.P. Morgan & Co. to turn around the failing Montgomery Ward and succeeded in restoring its profitability by making huge changes. In 1936, Fortune magazine said that Avery was ""generally held to be the No. 1 Chicago businessman."" In the postwar years, however, he failed to take advantage of the demand for durable goods and did not expand Montgomery Ward, costing it prominence in the retail field. Avery was active in Chicago civil activities, for instance, supporting the Commercial Club's plan for a Museum of Science and Industry and serving as its first president. He was also prominent in social circles, and in 1912 founded the private Lincoln Park Gun Club with Oscar F. Mayer, Philip K. Wrigley, and other prominent Chicagoans.","(189, 7)","Sewell Lee Avery (November 4, 1874 – November 5, 1944) was an African American educator, civil rights activist, and author. Avery is best known for his work as a teacher and president of Atlanta's Spelman College, where he helped to create the first black college in the South.

Avery was born in Decatur, Alabama, on November 4th, 1874. He was the eldest of twelve children born to enslaved parents, George and Elizabeth Avery. Sewell's father had been born a slave in Georgia, but had been emancipated and moved to Alabama in 1847. Upon emancipation, George Avery became a carpenter and house painter.

As a child, Sewell attended segregated schools in Decatur. In 1892 he enrolled at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, where he studied mathematics and science. After two years at Tuskegee, Avery left to attend Hampton Institute in Virginia. There he studied theology and completed his undergraduate studies in 1896.

Avery returned to Alabama in 1896 to become an instructor at Tuskegee Institute. He remained there for six years before moving to Atlanta in 1902 to take a position as principal of Atlanta's Hampton Institute Preparatory School. Avery soon became involved in the city's burgeoning black community. In 1906 he co-founded the Atlanta Urban League with W. E. B. Du Bois; he served as its first president until 1910.

Dana was born into a wealthy family of New York society in 1920. They lost almost all of their money and property in the wake of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Because part of those funds had already been set aside in trust funds for the education of Dana and her two sisters, they received a thorough education at the Lenox School. Her younger sister, Leora Dana, went on to become a stage and screen star; her older sister, Ethel Dana, became a medical doctor and relocated to California. Doris Dana received a Bachelor's degree in Classics (Latin) from Barnard College, Columbia University. Although she briefly taught night school in New York City, the job that she held the longest was to write script ""treatments"" in New York City during the 1950s, until Mistral's death in 1957 provided her with so much money that she never worked full-time again.","(215, 8)","Doris Dana (1920 – November 28, 2006) was an American singer and actress.

Francoist Spain or the Francoist dictatorship , ","Francoist Spain   or the Francoist dictatorship , was the period of Spanish history between 1939 and 1975, when Francisco Franco ruled Spain with the title . After his death in 1975, Spain transitioned into a democracy. During this time period Spain was officially known as the Spanish State . The nature of the regime evolved and changed during its existence. Months after the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed head of state on 1 April 1939, ruling a dictatorship over the territory controlled by the Nationalist faction. The 1937 Unification Decree, which merged all parties supporting the rebel side, led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the FET y de las JONS. The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the exile of Republican institutions. The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as ""fascistized dictatorship"", or ""semi-fascist regime"", showing clear influence of fascism in fields such as labor relations, the autarkic economic policy, aesthetics, and the single-party system. As time went on, the regime opened up and became closer to developmental dictatorships, although it always preserved residual fascist trappings.","(231, 9)","Francoist Spain   or the Francoist State was a dictatorship in Spain that lasted from 1936 to 1975. It was led by General Francisco Franco, who ruled until his death in 1975. The state was characterized by authoritarianism and social conservatism, as well as a strong emphasis on the Catholic Church.

After the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, Franco's Nationalist forces emerged victorious. As a result, Franco became dictator of Spain and ruled through a dictatorship, which suppressed political opposition and made radical changes to the economy and social structures. Under Franco's guidance, Spain became a one-party state and remained so until his death in 1975. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 granted limited autonomy to the semi-autonomous regions of Castile and León and Balearic Islands, while retaining the central government's power to intervene in their affairs.

During the early decades of the dictatorship, Spain saw rapid economic growth, which supported the regime's autocratic rule. However, after 1970s Spain entered a period of economic decline, which caused major social problems such as unemployment and poverty.

The Greeks or Hellenes (; , Éllines ","The Greeks or Hellenes (; , Éllines ) are an ethnic group and nation native to the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea regions, namely Greece, Cyprus, Albania, Italy, Turkey, Egypt and, to a lesser extent, other countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. They also form a significant diaspora, with Greek communities established around the world. Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, but the Greek people have always been centered on the Aegean and Ionian seas, where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age. Until the early 20th century, Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula, the western coast of Asia Minor, the Black Sea coast, Cappadocia in central Anatolia, Egypt, the Balkans, Cyprus, and Constantinople. Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization. The cultural centers of the Greeks have included Athens, Thessalonica, Alexandria, Smyrna, and Constantinople at various periods.","(207, 6)","The Greeks or Hellenes (; , Éllines, Hellenes; ), were a nation and cultural group native to the Greek peninsula, who spoke the Greek language and were predominantly Christian. They formed an important part of the population and culture of ancient Greece, where they flourished for over two thousand years.

The Greeks are a people who have been identified with the Hellenes in ancient Greece, particularly in Athens. The ethnonym derives from the ancient Greek word Hellas (Ἑλλάς), which referred to the southernmost region of mainland Greece. Herodotus is often cited as the first historian to use the term Hellenes to describe the inhabitants of southern Greece.

The Greeks are ethnically and linguistically homogeneous, although there are significant differences among them in terms of religion, politics, and culture. Nevertheless, they share many common elements such as the Mycenaean civilisation, which flourished during their Bronze Age period, Classical antiquity, which saw their greatest achievements in literature and philosophy, and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

The first recorded use of the term ""Greeks"" is in Herodotus' Histories, which refers to them as Γραικοί (Greeks), where he distinguishes them from Ionian Greeks and Aeolian Peloponnesians. He describes them as a people who live in the Peloponnese, whose language he does not know.

Black July (; Kalu Juliya) was an ","Black July (;  Kalu Juliya) was an anti-Tamil pogrom that occurred in Sri Lanka during July 1983. The pogrom was premeditated, and was finally triggered by a deadly ambush on 23 July 1983, which caused the death of 13 Sri Lanka Army soldiers, by the Tamil militant group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Although initially orchestrated by members of the ruling UNP, the pogrom soon escalated into mass violence with significant public participation. On the night of 24 July 1983, anti-Tamil rioting started in the capital city of Colombo and then spread to other parts of the country. Over seven days, mainly Sinhalese mobs attacked, burned, looted, and killed Tamil civilians. Estimates of the death toll range between 400 and 3,000, and 150,000 people became homeless. Around 8,000 homes and 5,000 shops were destroyed. The economic cost of the riots was estimated to be $300 million. The NGO International Commission of Jurists described the pogrom as a genocide in a report published in December 1983.","(190, 9)","Black July (;  Kalu Juliya) was a month-long period of civil unrest in Sri Lanka in 1983. The events leading to the unrest are still disputed.

On 7 July 1983, the military government of Sri Lanka announced a series of free and fair elections for the month of November. However, the military government also introduced a new security law, the Defense and Security Act, which was seen by many as an attempt to curtail political opposition. This led to protests and large demonstrations throughout the country.

On 18 July 1983, a group of soldiers marched on the Presidential Palace in Colombo, demanding that President J. R. Jayawardene step down. After negotiations failed, the soldiers stormed the palace and took President Jayawardene hostage. The next day, 19 July, the military responded with a violent crackdown on civilian protesters. This is now known as Black July. Over the course of the next several days, over 300 people were killed and thousands were injured. The military government eventually lost control of the country and was replaced by a democratic government in 1986.","(202, 11)","Black July (; Kalu Juliya) was an 11-day anti-Tamil pogrom that took place in Sri Lanka from July 23 to August 2, 1983.

The violence was sparked by an ambush on a Sri Lankan Army patrol by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which resulted in the deaths of 13 soldiers. In response, Sinhalese mobs attacked Tamil communities across the country, targeting homes, businesses, and places of worship. The attacks were characterized by widespread looting, arson, and brutality, with many victims being hacked to death or burned alive. The exact number of fatalities remains disputed, with estimates ranging from 400 to over 3,000. The Black July riots had a profound impact on Sri Lankan society, exacerbating ethnic tensions and further polarizing the conflict. The international community condemned the violence, with many countries imposing economic sanctions on Sri Lanka.

Cirquent calculus is a proof calculus that ","Cirquent calculus is a proof calculus that manipulates graph-style constructs termed cirquents, as opposed to the traditional tree-style objects such as formulas or sequents. Cirquents come in a variety of forms, but they all share one main characteristic feature, making them different from the more traditional objects of syntactic manipulation. This feature is the ability to explicitly account for possible sharing of subcomponents between different components. For instance, it is possible to write an expression where two subexpressions F and E, while neither one is a subexpression of the other, still have a common occurrence of a subexpression G (as opposed to having two different occurrences of G, one in F and one in E). Overview
The approach was introduced by G. Japaridze in  as an alternative proof theory capable of “taming” various nontrivial fragments of his computability logic, which had otherwise resisted all axiomatization attempts within the traditional proof-theoretic frameworks. The origin of the term “cirquent” is CIRcuit+seQUENT, as the simplest form of cirquents, while resembling circuits rather than formulas, can be thought of as collections of one-sided sequents (for instance, sequents of a given level of a Gentzen-style proof tree) where some sequents may have shared elements.

Cirquent calculus is a proof calculus that focusses on the use of cirques to prove properties about mathematical expressions. Cirquent calculus was developed by Simon Polak and is described in his thesis ""Cirquent Calculus: A New Proof Language and its Applications"" (PDF). cirques are a type of looping structure often found in mathematics and computer science, used to represent recursive functions. In cirquent calculus, a cirque is used to represent a function that takes one input and returns another input. The function can be represented as a set of nested loops, where each loop contains the input and output of the previous loop.

One of the main benefits of using cirques to represent functions is that they can be easily mapped onto structural equation models (SEM). SEMs are a popular tool for predicting the outcomes of complex interactions between variables. By mapping cirques onto SEMs, it is possible to automatically determine the effects of changes to the variables on the outcome. This allows for more accurate predictions than would be possible with traditional methods.

Another benefit of using cirques to represent functions is that they provide a compact way to represent recursive functions. By compactly representing recursive functions,","(269, 13)","Cirquent calculus is a proof calculus that  generalizes both linear logic and classical logic.

Cirquent calculus is notable for its ability to capture a wide range of logical systems, including both classical and intuitionistic logics, as well as various substructural logics such as relevance logic and linear logic. By providing a unified framework for reasoning about different logical systems, cirquent calculus has significant implications for the study of logic, mathematics, and computer science, particularly in areas such as proof theory, model theory, and formal verification.

Known familiarly from childhood as 'Elsie', Grant was born in Edinburgh on 21 July 1887, but grew up with a strong sense of belonging to the Scottish Highlands and especially the area around Badenoch and Strathspey, with its ancient links to the Clan Grant. A family member of the Grants of Tullochgorm, and daughter of a colonel in the Seaforth Highlanders, she was sent to London and the care of her grandfather Field Marshal Sir Patrick Grant, Goldstick-in-Waiting to Queen Victoria, and his daughter Miss Frances Gough Grant – known as 'Aunt Fan' – when her parents were posted to India. It was Aunt Fan who accompanied Elsie on early visits to museums and art galleries in London, inspiring a life-long interest in material culture and collecting. Later visits to folk museums in Scandinavia encouraged Elsie to dream of a museum for the Highlands and Islands that would preserve and promote a better appreciation of the rapidly disappearing material cultures and Gaelic traditions of northern and western Scotland.","(210, 5)","Isabel Frances Grant MBE (1887–1983) was a British suffragette, writer and broadcaster.

Perryella is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian ","Perryella is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian temnospondyl. The type and only species, P. olsoni, was named in 1987 from the Wellington Formation of Oklahoma, which is Early Permian in age. It is known from several skulls and partial remains of vertebrae and limbs. It has large orbits, or eye sockets, and large otic notches (rounded indentations at the back of the skull). A bone called the palatine, which is usually found on the underside of the skull, is partially exposed on the top of the skull. Present on the margin of the orbit, the palatine takes the place of the lacrimal bone, which usually touches the orbit in temnospondyls. Another distinguishing feature of Perryella is the presence of two small projections on the quadratojugal bone at the back of the skull. The lowermost projection forms a cup-like shape that attaches to the lower jaw. The classification of Perryella was at first uncertain because it shared features with two groups, Trimerorhachidae and Dissorophoidea, which were thought to be distantly related. In 2006, a phylogenetic analysis involving Perryella placed it within Dvinosauria as an intermediate form between trimerorhachids and other dvinosaurs.","(214, 10)","Perryella is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian theropod dinosaur that lived in the Late Cretaceous Period, about 80 million years ago. It was a small, slender dvinosaurian, with a long tail and a small head. It was the only known member of its genus.

Perryella was first described by American palaeontologist Charles Whitney in 1927. The type specimen, NHMUK R.5337, is a partial skeleton that consists of the skull, forelimbs, and hindlimbs. It is missing the front legs and most of the tail. The skeleton was discovered in the Isle of Wight in southern England.

Perryella is a diminutive dvinosaurian, measuring only 2 metres (6.6 feet) long and weighing about 40 kilograms (88 pounds). Its skeleton is relatively undeveloped for its size, with only the skull and some skeletal elements preserved. Despite its small size, Perryella had a long tail and a small head. Its teeth were supplemented by serrated blades on the jaws, which may have been used to eat meat.

Despite its small size and undeveloped skeleton, Perryella is one of the most primitive dvinosaurs known. It shares many features with other primitive dvinosaurs such as Allosaurus fragilis and Sinraptor ostrommaysorum, which suggests that it was an early member of this group of dinosaurs. Perryella may have been an active predator that hunted smaller animals such","(248, 14)","Perryella is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian  parareptiles that lived during the Early Permian period, approximately 280 million years ago. The name Perryella was coined by paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer in 1945. Perryella fossils have been discovered in the United States, specifically in the state of Texas. These ancient reptiles were characterized by their elongated bodies, short limbs, and distinctive skull morphology. Perryella species were likely semi-aquatic, inhabiting freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands. The genus is classified within the family Dvinosauridae, a group of parareptiles known for their unique adaptations to aquatic environments. Perryella is considered one of the most primitive members of the Dvinosauridae family, providing valuable insights into the evolution of these ancient reptiles. The discovery of Perryella fossils has contributed significantly to our understanding of the Permian period's biodiversity and the early history of reptilian evolution. Further research on Perryella is ongoing, with ongoing excavations and studies aimed at uncovering more information about this enigmatic genus. The study of Perryella continues to captivate paleontologists and scientists, offering a glimpse into the lives of ancient creatures that once inhabited our planet. ### | End of Response | ### ### | Instruction | ###

The name Perryella was coined by paleontologist Alfred Sherwood Romer in 1945. Perryella fossils have been discovered in the United States, specifically in the state of Texas. These ancient reptiles were characterized by their elongated bodies, short limbs, and distinctive skull morphology. Perryella species were likely semi-aquatic, inhabiting freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands. The genus is classified within the family Dvinosauridae, a group of parareptiles known for their unique adaptations to aquatic environments. Perryella is considered one of the most primitive members of the Dvinosauridae family, providing valuable insights into the evolution of these ancient reptiles. The discovery of Perryella fossils has contributed significantly to our understanding of the Permian period's biodiversity and the early history of reptilian evolution. Further research on Perryella is ongoing, with ongoing excavations and studies aimed at uncovering more information about this enigmatic genus. The study of Perryella continues to captivate paleontologists and scientists, offering a glimpse into the lives of ancient creatures that once inhabited our planet.

The 1910 Cuba hurricane, popularly known as ","The 1910 Cuba hurricane, popularly known as the Cyclone of the Five Days, was an unusual and destructive tropical cyclone that struck Cuba and the United States in October 1910. It formed in the southern Caribbean on October 9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October 16, corresponding to Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. That same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged the coast of the Southeastern United States on its way out to sea. Due to its unusual loop, initial reports suggested it was two separate storms that developed and hit land in rapid succession. Its track was subject to much debate at the time; eventually, it was identified as a single storm. Analysis of the event gave a greater understanding of weather systems that took similar paths.","(191, 9)","The 1910 Cuba hurricane, popularly known as the Great Hurricane of 1910, was the most intense and destructive hurricane in the history of Cuba. Formed on October 25 near the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane rapidly strengthened as it moved towards the Caribbean Sea. On October 29, the hurricane made landfall near Yara, Cuba as a Category 4 storm with winds estimated at 185 mph (300 km/h). The cyclone rapidly weakened as it moved over land, and dissipated on November 5 near Key West. The hurricane killed at least 1,500 people in Cuba, injured thousands more, and caused $120 million (1910 USD) in damage.

Due to this great variety of influences, Bulgaria has adopted many unusual traditions. Thracian artifacts include numerous temples, tombs, golden treasures and ancient rites and rituals, while ancient Bulgars have left traces of their heritage in statehood, early architecture, music and dances. Thracian rituals such as the Tryphon Zarezan which is dedicated to Saint Tryphon of Campsada, Kukeri and Martenitza are to this day kept alive in the modern Bulgarian culture.
The oldest treasure of worked gold in the world, dating back to the 5th millennium BC, comes from the site of the Varna Necropolis. Bulgaria functioned as the hub of Slavic Europe during much of the Middle Ages, exerting considerable literary and cultural influence over the Eastern Orthodox Slavic world by means of the Preslav and Ohrid Literary Schools.

The Principality of Bulgaria emerged in 827 AD and became an independent Bulgarian state in 927 AD. In 1256, Bulgaria entered into a union with the Byzantine Empire, which ended in 1396 with the fall of the Second Bulgarian Empire. The Ottoman Turks conquered Bulgaria in 1444, and Bulgaria became part of the Ottoman Empire. A period of great change began in 1878, when Bulgaria became a republic under Prince Ferdinand I. In 1885, Ferdinand I was assassinated and his son Alexander was forced to abdicate the throne. A period of political instability followed until 1912, when Ferdinand II was restored to the throne. In 1918, Bulgaria became a member of the First World War-era Balkan League and fought in the war against Serbia and Greece. In 1934, Alexander Stamboliyski was assassinated, and his son Boris III was forced to abdicate the throne. A period of political instability followed until 1945, when Bulgaria became a communist state under Tsar Boris III. A coup in 1946 led to the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a People's Republic of Bulgaria.

Alcyone is an opera by the French ","Alcyone is an opera by the French composer Marin Marais. It takes the form of a tragédie en musique in a prologue and five acts. The libretto, by Antoine Houdar de la Motte, is based on the Greek myth of Ceyx and Alcyone as recounted by Ovid in his Metamorphoses. The opera was first performed on 18 February 1706 by the Académie royale de musique at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in Paris. The score is particularly famous for the storm scene (tempête) in act 4. The ""Marche pour les Matelots"", from act 3, became popular as a dance tune and is the basis of the Christmas carol ""Masters in This Hall"". Having been recorded by Erato in 1990, Alcione received its first stage production since the composer's death as the first work to appear at the newly refurbished Opéra Comique in Paris on 25 April 2017; directed by Louise Moaty, Jordi Savall conducted Le Concert des Nations, with Lea Desandre in the title role and Marc Mauillon, Cyril Auvity, Lisandro Abadie and Antonio Abete among the cast.","(201, 7)","Alcyone is an opera by the French composer Georges Bizet.

Ceyx, a sea-god, falls in love with her and helps her to escape. They marry and have a son named Zephyr. After Zephyr is killed by Apollo, Alcyone kills herself.

Louis XV (15 February 1710 – 10 ","Louis XV (15 February 1710 – 10 May 1774), known as Louis the Beloved , was King of France from 1 September 1715 until his death in 1774. He succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV at the age of five. Until he reached maturity (then defined as his 13th birthday) on 15 February 1723, the kingdom was ruled by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, as Regent of France.
Cardinal Fleury was chief minister from 1726 until his death in 1743, at which time the king took sole control of the kingdom. His reign of almost 59 years (from 1715 to 1774) was the second longest in the history of France, exceeded only by his predecessor, Louis XIV, who had ruled for 72 years (from 1643 to 1715).  In 1748, Louis returned the Austrian Netherlands, won at the Battle of Fontenoy of 1745. He ceded New France in North America to Great Britain and Spain at the conclusion of the disastrous Seven Years' War in 1763. He incorporated the territories of the Duchy of Lorraine and the Corsican Republic into the Kingdom of France. Historians generally criticise his reign, citing how reports of his corruption embarrassed the monarchy, while his wars drained the treasury while producing little gain. His grandson and successor Louis XVI would inherit a kingdom in need of financial and political reform which would ultimately lead to the French Revolution of 1789.","(264, 10)","Louis XV (15 February 1710 – 10 May 1774) was a French monarch who reigned from 1715 to 1774. He was the last Bourbon King of France, and his reign is known for the French Revolution.

Born at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Louis was the eldest son of Louis XIV and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Spain. At the age of five, he became King of France when his father died, although he was not crowned until two years later. In 1723, at age seven, Louis became Crown Prince of France. Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were his parents' only children.

At the death of his father in 1765, Louis XV became King of France and Navarre. He continued the French Revolution by his actions during the Reign of Terror and the War in the Vendée. In 1770, he executed Louis Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien for high treason in a public show trial. The execution led to international condemnation and brought him into conflict with many of France's European allies.

In 1774, after the death of his two younger brothers, Louis XVI was forced to abdicate in favour of his infant son Louis XVIII. He lived out the rest of his life in exile in Prussia and Austria, dying on 10 May 1774 at the Palace of Versailles.","(250, 12)","Louis XV (15 February 1710 – 10  May 1774) was the King of France from 1715 until his death in 1774.

During his reign, Louis XV faced numerous challenges, including the War of the Polish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, and the Seven Years' War. Despite these conflicts, he implemented various reforms, such as the establishment of the Encyclopédie, a comprehensive reference work that aimed to promote Enlightenment values. The king's personal life was also marked by controversy, particularly his relationship with Madame de Pompadour, a prominent courtesan who exerted significant influence over him. Louis XV's foreign policy was characterized by a series of alliances and treaties, including the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which aimed to maintain a delicate balance of power in Europe. His reign was also notable for the rise of the French Enlightenment, which emphasized reason, science, and intellectual curiosity. Throughout his life, Louis XV struggled with poor health, which ultimately contributed to his early death at the age of 64. Despite his controversies and challenges, Louis XV remains an important figure in French history, and his legacy continues to be studied and debated by historians and scholars today.

Paul Zeltwanger (born March 28, 1966) is ","Paul Zeltwanger (born March 28, 1966) is the Representative of the 54th district of the Ohio House of Representatives.  Zeltwanger entered the primary election against Peter Beck, who was facing dozens of felony charges, and Mary Jo Kubicki.  He won the primary with 51% of the vote, and won the general election with 72% of the vote. Zeltwanger works as a real-estate developer. He is a certified public accountant. COVID-19 and impeachment 
In August 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, he joined John Becker, Candice Keller, and Nino Vitale in sponsoring a move to impeach against Mike DeWine, Ohio's Republican governor. The move was widely and immediately panned on both sides of the aisle and by legal scholars and commentators. Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken ""issued a scathing condemnation of the trio of conservatives"", calling the move “a baseless, feeble attempt at creating attention for themselves.” Ohio House Speaker, Republican Bob Cupp, called it an ""imprudent attempt"" to cause ""a state constitutional crisis"". Legal scholar Jonathan Entin said the proposal ""means that we’ve distorted our understanding both of what impeachment is supposed to do and how people – especially, elected officials – are supposed to disagree with each other. Do we really want to say that the government can’t act in an emergency because the officials are afraid that if they do anything, they’ll be removed from office? Of course, if they don’t do anything, maybe the response is going to be ‘Well you should be impeached for not acting.' CNN's Chris Cillizza analyzed it as one of several examples of how Donald Trump had politicized public health matters to the point Republican lawmakers felt they needed to make extreme and pointless moves in order to satisfy the base. DeWine responded by recommending his foes visit a hospital and talk to nurses.","(357, 13)","Paul Zeltwanger (born March 28, 1966) is a German-born American biochemist who is a Professor of Biochemistry at the University of California, Irvine.

Historically in North America, ""livery stable"" had a somewhat different meaning: a stable where horses, teams and wagons were for hire, but also where privately owned horses could be boarded for a short time.

The rebellion began on 17 August 1977, with a series of coordinated nationwide strikes and demonstrations, and lasted for almost three years until it was suppressed by the Pakistani military. The uprising was led by Mohandas Gandhi's grandson, Arvind Kejriwal, who became the country's first democratically elected Prime Minister after the rebellion's conclusion. The uprising was notable for its widespread violence and its regional dimensions, as well as for its significant economic, political, and social impacts.

Pakistan is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia. It is the most populous country in the region and sixth-largest in the world.

The coup was the culmination of a long-standing power struggle between Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and the country's military establishment. Tensions between the two had been escalating since the PPP's landslide victory in the 1970 general elections, which saw Bhutto become the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Pakistan.

The war began on March 25, 1971, when East Pakistan declared its independence from Pakistan as the independent state of Bangladesh. The war ended in December 1971 with the surrender of the Pakistani army.
The conflict was triggered by the Pakistani government's decision to impose Urdu as the sole official language of East Pakistan. The Bengali-speaking people of East Pakistan were outraged by this decision, which they saw as an attempt by West Pakistan to impose its culture on them.
The Bengali people also felt that they were being discriminated against by the West Pakistani government. For example, they were not allowed to serve in the Pakistani army, which was dominated by West Pakistanis. They were also not allowed to hold high-ranking positions in the government or the military.
In addition, the Bengali people felt that their culture was being suppressed by the West Pakistan government. They wanted to be able to speak their own language, wear their own clothes, and practice their own religion. They also wanted the right to self-determination, which meant that they should be able to decide for themselves whether or not they wanted to be part of Pakistan.
The Pakistani government responded to these demands by imposing martial law in East Pakistan.

It was led by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who seized power from the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The coup was the culmination of a long-standing power struggle between Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and the country's military establishment. Tensions between the two had been escalating since the PPP's landslide victory in the 1970 general elections, which saw Bhutto become the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Pakistan. Bhutto's policies, including land reforms and nationalization of key industries, were seen as a threat to the interests of the country's powerful landowning elite and the military. The coup marked the beginning of a period of military rule in Pakistan, which lasted for over a decade and had far-reaching consequences for the country's politics, economy, and society.
